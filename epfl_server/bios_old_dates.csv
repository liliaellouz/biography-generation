"Rabbi Samuel ben Abraham Aboab (Hebrew:     ; c. 1610 – August 22, 1694) also known by his acronym RaSHA ("", Rabbi Shmuel ben Avraham) was a 17th century Western Sephardic rabbi and scholar, who is considered to be one of the greatest rabbinic sages of Italy. [SEP] He served as the av bet din of Venice, where he rose to great prominence due to his vast knowledge of rabbinic literature. He is known for being an adamant opponent of the Sabbatean movement, and an early supporter of the old Yishuv.    Born into the Aboab family in Hamburg, Germany in 1610. His father Abraham Aboab V, was a former Crypto-Jew and founding father of the Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg. At age 13, Rabbi Samuel was sent by his father to study in Venice under Rabbi David Franco, whose daughter, Mazzal-Tov Franco he later married at age eighteen. He was soon appointed Chief Rabbi of Verona, where he garnered such a reputation for learning that disciples sought him out, such as Samson Morpurgo and Jacob Hagiz, even the learned rabbis of Italy turned to him with difficult religious questions. Rabbi Samuel was also acquainted with secular learning and knew several languages including Latin, German, Ladino and Italian. After serving as Chief Rabbi of Verona, he was appointed Av Bet Din of Venice in 1650, where he became involved in the controversy concerning Sabbethai Zevi and his apostle, Nathan of Gaza, who confessed to Rabbi Samuel, that his prophecies concerning the Messianic character of Sabbethai Zevi were mere deceptions. Rabbi Samuel was also responsible for obtaining financial support from Jewish communities in Western Europe for the Jewish settlements in the Land of Israel, particularly those in Hebron. In 1643, he collected funds for the ransoming of the Jews of Kremsier taken captive by the Swedes. In his advanced age Rabbi Samuel became the victim of many misfortunes. Domestic troubles and severe illness afflicted him, as well as a dispute with the doge who forced him to leave Venice. It was only shortly before his death that he received permission from the doge to return to the city and to reassume his office, which in his absence had been conducted by his son Joseph, who later immigrated to Hebron. Rabbi Samuel died on August 22, 1694 in Venice. His son Jacob Aboab, was also a prominent rabbi in Venice, whose descendants eventually settled in Turkey.   "
"Giovanni Battista Agnello (fl. 1560–1577) was a Venetian alchemist working in London in the 1560s and 1570s. [SEP] He was the author of the second book in Italian printed in England, Espositione sopra vn libro intitolato Apocalypsis spiritus secreti. He was also the first to declare that the ore brought back by Martin Frobisher from Baffin Island contained gold.    Agnello described himself on the title page of a published work in 1566 as 'Giovanbatista Agnello Venetiano'; however the date of his arrival in England from his native Venice is unknown. According to Castells, he was among a number of 'Protestant men of learning who came to London as a result of the Reformation'. Some sources state that he was the 'J.B. Agnelli' authorized to import gold bullion for use in English coinage from 1547 to 1549. However Jones states that Agnello did not arrive in England until 1569. According to Harkness, he lived in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and operated a 'dangerous blast furnace' there. What is known with certainty is that Agnello was recommended to Sir William Cecil by Jean de Ferrieres (1520–1586), the Vidame of Chartres, who on 4 November 1569 wrote to Cecil from Holborn commending Agnello as 'a man of honest and industry'. With his letter, the Vidame sent Cecil a copy of Agnello's book, saying that he wished it had been printed on cleaner paper, 'but that of dusky hue best suits the works of Vulcanicorum hominum'.Shortly after this, Agnello suggested a plan to Queen Elizabeth I to make lead testons and to remedy the 'scarcity of pence, half pence, and other small coins'.     At the beginning of January 1577 Agnello was approached by Michael Lok, one of the principal backers of Martin Frobisher's first voyage in 1576 to the Canadian Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. On the voyage a black stone 'as great as a half-penny loaf' had been collected loose on the surface of Hall's Island off Baffin Island by Robert Garrard, who took it to be sea coal, of which they had need.In a letter to the Queen on 22 April 1577 Lok stated that the stone was presented to him on Frobisher's ship on 13 October 1576 in the presence of Rowland Yorke as 'the first thing Frobisher had found in the new land'. The only contemporary account of what happened next is found in George Best's True Discourse: After his arrival in London, being demanded of sundry his friends what thing he had brought them home of that country, [Frobisher] had nothing left to present them withal but a piece of this black stone. And it fortuned a gentlewoman, one of the adventurer’s wives, to have a piece thereof, which by chance she threw and burned in the fire so long that at the length being taken forth and quenched in a little vinegar it glistered with a bright marquesset of gold. Whereupon the matter being called in some question, it was brought to certain goldfinders in London to make assay thereof, who indeed found it to hold gold, and that very richly for the quantity. Afterwards the same goldfinders promised great matters thereof if there were any store to be found, and offered themselves to adventure for the searching of those parts from whence the same was brought.  Some that had great hope of the matter sought secretly to have a lease at her Majesty’s hands of those places, whereby to enjoy the mass of so great a public profit unto their own private gains. In conclusion, the hope of the same gold ore to be found kindled a greater opinion in the hearts of many to advance the voyage again. Best does not identify the adventurer's wife; modern sources conclude that she was Michael Lok's second wife, Margery Perient (died c.1583), the widow of Cesare Adelmare, a Venetian like Agnello. Doubt has been cast on Best's account, however, since there is no mention of Margery Lok's involvement in the voluminous depositions and letters of Michael Lok himself.Irrespective of whether the story of Lok's wife's actions is to be believed, extant documents confirm that Lok suspected that the stone might contain gold, and took pieces of it for analysis to William Williams, Assay Master of the Mint, and to two members of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths: one Wheeler, a gold refiner, and George Needham, Assay Master of the Society of the Mines Royal, none of whom found any trace of gold.Despite these negative results Lok persisted, and in early January 1577 took three small pieces of the stone to Agnello, as described in one of Lok's later depositions: In the beginning of January I delivered a small piece thereof to John Baptista Agnello, not telling what nor from whence, but prayed him to prove what metal was therein. And within three days I came to him for answer. He showed me a very little powder of gold, saying it came thereout, and willed me to give him another piece to make a better proof.  I did so, and within three days again he showed me more powder of gold.  I told him I would not believe it without better proof. He asked another piece to make a better proof, saying that he would make anatomy thereof. I gave it him saying that I marvelled much of his doings sith I had given pieces to other 3 to make proof who could find no such thing there. He answered me, Bisogna sapere adulare la natura. Lok was secretly reporting the results of the assays to Sir Francis Walsingham, who had Sir Edward Dyer analyse a sample of the ore. Dyer found no gold, confirming Walsingham in his view that Agnello's results were 'but an alchemist matter'. Agnello and Lok were not discouraged; Agnello advised Lok that he had a 'friend in the court' who would move the Queen to grant them a licence to mine the ore, and on 19 March 1557 Lok and Agnello entered into an agreement for bringing back to England more ore like the original black stone. However, by then the secret had leaked out, largely through Agnello's own indiscretion. Sir William Winter asked to meet with Lok on 29 March, and revealed that he had learned of Agnello's assays of the ore from Sir William Morgan, who had had the news from Sir John Berkeley, who had had it from Agnello himself. Moreover, not only had Agnello communicated his findings to Berkeley, but he had been assisted in some of his tests by Christopher Schutz, a German metallurgist working in London who had been introduced to Agnello by Berkeley and Morgan. According to Winter, the matter was of too great importance for himself and Lok, and fit only for 'the Prince'. In a lengthy letter dated 22 April 1577 Lok outlined all these matters to the Queen, and enclosed therewith six 'writings' to him from Agnello, as well as a copy of the contract signed by himself and Agnello.Agnello was later involved in assaying the tons of black ore brought back to England on Frobisher's second voyage to Baffin Island in 1577. Between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 Christopher Schutz performed three 'great proofes' of this ore. Agnello and another German metallurgist working in England, Burchard Kranich, also assayed the ore. Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Martin Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'. Numerous documents survive showing Kranich's involvement in the assaying of the ore, including a letter of 26 November 1577 in which Kranich reported to Sir Francis Walsingham on the amount of gold found in his tests. Amid growing doubts about the value of the ore, Kranich insisted that it contained a significant amount of gold, and asked for £200 and a daily wage of £1 to refine it. On 20 December 1577 Agnello submitted his own report to Walsingham on the amount of gold to be found in the ore. According to Castells an English alchemist named George Wolfe was then brought in to assist Agnello; there were disagreements as to methodology, after which Agnello was 'shut out of the enterprise'.Despite the favourable findings of Schutz, Kranich and Agnello, the hornblende ore from Baffin Island contained no gold, and it was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to £50 per ton. The story that Kranich allegedly doctored the assay tests is found in a deposition to the Privy Council by Michael Lok; in the deposition Lok claims that the evidence of Kranich's fraud was presented to Lord Burghley at his house in the Strand in the presence of Lok, Sir Walter Mildmay, and all the Commissioners involved in supervising the Frobisher expeditions.Modern research has confirmed that the 1,400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island in 1577 and 1578 were not gold-bearing. Moreover, the original black stone on which Agnello conducted his tests in January 1577 had been found on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage; according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'.Despite having been the first to declare that the ultimately worthless ore contained gold, Agnello appears to have survived the Frobisher debacle relatively unscathed. Investors, including a number of prominent courtiers, among them Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who invested £3,000, lost heavily, and the lawsuits which followed ruined Michael Lok.Agnello's date of death is unknown.

"Domenico Alberti (c. 1710 – 14 October 1740 or 1746) was an Italian singer, harpsichordist, and composer. [SEP] Alberti was born in Venice and studied music with Antonio Lotti. He wrote operas, songs, and sonatas for keyboard instruments, for which he is best known today. These sonatas frequently employ arpeggiated accompaniment in the left hand in one of several patterns that are now collectively known as Alberti bass. Alberti was one of the earliest composers to use these patterns, but was not the first or only. The most well-known of these patterns consists of regular broken chords, with the lowest note sounding first, then the highest, then the middle and then the highest again. This pattern is repeated. Today, Alberti is regarded as a minor composer, and his works are played or recorded only irregularly. The Alberti bass was used by many later composers, and it became an important element in much keyboard music of the Classical music era. An example of Alberti bass (Mozart's Piano Sonata, K 545):  In his own lifetime, Alberti was known as a singer. He often used to accompany himself on the harpsichord. In 1736, he served as a page for Pietro Andrea Cappello, the Venetian ambassador to Spain. While at the Spanish court, the famous castrato singer Farinelli heard him sing. Farinelli was said to have been impressed, although Alberti was an amateur. Alberti's best known pieces are his keyboard sonatas, although even they are very rarely performed. It is thought he wrote around 36 sonatas, of which 14 have survived. They all have two movements, each in binary form. It is probable that Mozart's first violin sonatas, written at the age of seven, were modeled on Alberti's work. Alberti died in 1740 or 1746 in Rome.   "
"Pietro Cesare Alberti (1608–1655) — later Peter Caesar Alburtus — was a Venetian immigrant to the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, commonly regarded as the first Italian American settler at least in what is now New York State. [SEP]    Pietro Alberti was born on the island of Malamocco in 1608 at the height of Venice's commercial power. There is no evidence for the former assertion that Pietro was the son of the Secretary of the Ducal Treasury, Andrea Alberti and his wife, Lady Veronica Cremona, but his family were apparently a Venetian branch of the powerful Florentine Alberti family and were attested as members of the Church of San Luca from 1326. The family was influential throughout the Italian peninsula and also had a branch in Genoa. Pietro's paternal relatives may have included the famed Italian polymath and statesman Leon Battista Alberti.     During the Thirty Years' War troops from the Netherlands were stationed in Malamocco, a narrow inlet in the Venetian Lagoon. These troops carried with them a particularly virulent strain of bubonic plague. The plague spread rapidly, killing 46,000 of the city's 140,000 residents. The immense decline in Venice's population led to a similar decline in its commercial power. Because the Albertis' power was derived from the success of Venetian traders, Pietro decided at the age of 27 to seek a new life in the New World. At some point, Alberti had also converted to Protestantism. He sailed from Texel aboard the Dutch ship De Coninck David (King David), arriving in New Amsterdam on June 2, 1635.  Alberti acclimated well in New Amsterdam's cosmopolitan environment. In 1642 he married a Walloon woman named Judith Manje (also spelled Magnee) in the Dutch Reformed Church. The couple had seven children from 1642 to 1655, including one who died in infancy. The Albertis lived in a home on Broad Street until 1646 when Pietro applied for a land grant from the Dutch. The Albertis farmed 100 acres in Brooklyn until Pietro and Judith were killed in an Indian raid in 1655.    Alberti was the first of millions of Italian Americans who would later form part of American culture. A small stone in New York City's Battery Park, near the bronze statue of Giovanni da Verrazzano, commemorates Pietro Alberti's arrival and declares June 2 to be ""Alberti Day"".Over the centuries, the family name Alberti had variations in spelling like Albertis, Alburtus, Alburtis and Burtis.  Indeed, nearly every American bearing the surnames Burtis and Alburtis can trace their ancestry back to Peter Caesar Alberti.   "
"Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was an Italian Baroque composer. [SEP] His output includes operas, concertos, sonatas for one to six instruments, sinfonias, and solo cantatas. While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is known today for his instrumental music, especially his concertos. He is also remembered today for a work called ""Adagio in G minor"", attributed to him but said to be written by Remo Giazotto, a modern musicologist and composer, who was a cataloger of the works of Albinoni.    Born in Venice, Republic of Venice, to Antonio Albinoni, a wealthy paper merchant in Venice, he studied violin and singing. Relatively little is known about his life, which is surprising considering his contemporary stature as a composer, and the comparatively well-documented period in which he lived. In 1694 he dedicated his Opus 1 to the fellow-Venetian, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (grand-nephew of Pope Alexander VIII). His first opera, Zenobia, regina de Palmireni, was produced in Venice in 1694. Albinoni was possibly employed in 1700 as a violinist to Charles IV, Duke of Mantua, to whom he dedicated his Opus 2 collection of instrumental pieces. In 1701 he wrote his hugely popular suites Opus 3, and dedicated that collection to Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.In 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi; Antonino Biffi, the maestro di cappella of San Marco was a witness, and evidently was a friend of Albinoni. Albinoni seems to have no other connection with that primary musical establishment in Venice, however, and achieved his early fame as an opera composer at many cities in Italy, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. During this time, he was also composing instrumental music in abundance: prior to 1705, he mostly wrote trio sonatas and violin concertos, but between then and 1719 he wrote solo sonatas and concertos for oboe.Unlike most contemporary composers, he appears never to have sought a post at either a church or noble court, but then he had independent means and could afford to compose music independently. In 1722, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, to whom Albinoni had dedicated a set of twelve concertos, invited him to direct two of his operas in Munich. Around 1740, a collection of Albinoni's violin sonatas was published in France as a posthumous work, and scholars long presumed that meant that Albinoni had died by that time. However, it appears he lived on in Venice in obscurity; a record from the parish of San Barnaba indicates Tomaso Albinoni died in Venice in 1751, of diabetes mellitus.     Most of his operatic works have been lost, largely because they were not published during his lifetime. However, nine collections of instrumental works were published. These were met with considerable success and consequent reprints. He is therefore known more as a composer of instrumental music (99 sonatas, 59 concerti and 9 sinfonie) today. In his lifetime these works were compared favourably with those of Arcangelo Corelli and Antonio Vivaldi. His nine collections published in Italy, Amsterdam and London were either dedicated to or sponsored by an impressive list of southern European nobility. Albinoni wrote at least fifty operas, of which twenty-eight were produced in Venice between 1723 and 1740. Albinoni himself claimed 81 operas (naming his second-to-last opera, in the libretto, as his 80th). In spite of his enormous operatic output, today he is most noted for his instrumental music, especially his oboe concerti (from 12 Concerti a cinque op. 7 and, most famously, 12 Concerti a cinque op. 9). He is the first Italian known to employ the oboe as a solo instrument in concerti (c. 1715, in his op. 7) and publish such works, although earlier concerti featuring solo oboe were probably written by German composers such as Telemann or Händel. In Italy, Alessandro Marcello published his well-known oboe concerto in D minor a little later, in 1717. Albinoni also employed the instrument often in his chamber works.  His instrumental music attracted great attention from Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote at least two fugues on Albinoni's themes (Fugue in A major on a theme by Tomaso Albinoni, BWV 950, and Fugue in B minor on a theme by Tomaso Albinoni, BWV 951) and frequently used his basses for harmonic exercises for his pupils. Part of Albinoni's work was lost in World War II with the destruction of the Dresden State Library. As a result, little is known of his life and music after the mid-1720s. The famous Adagio in G minor, the subject of many modern recordings, is thought by some to be a musical hoax composed by Remo Giazotto. However, a discovery by musicologist Muska Mangano, Giazotto's last assistant before his death, has cast some doubt on that belief. Among Giazotto's papers, Mangano discovered a modern but independent manuscript transcription of the figured bass portion, and six fragmentary bars of the first violin, ""bearing in the top right-hand corner a stamp stating unequivocally the Dresden provenance of the original from which it was taken"". This provides support for Giazotto's account that he did base his composition on an earlier source.   "

"Pope Alexander VIII (22 April 1610 – 1 February 1691), born Pietro Vito Ottoboni, was Pope from 6 October 1689 to his death in 1691. [SEP] He is to date the last pope to take the pontifical name of ""Alexander"" upon his election to the papacy.       Pietro Vito Ottoboni was born in 1610 of a noble Venetian family, and was the youngest of nine children of Vittoria Tornielli and Marco Ottoboni, grand chancellor of the Republic of Venice.His early studies were made with marked brilliance at the University of Padua where, in 1627, he earned a doctorate in canon and civil law. Ottoboni went to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Urban VIII and served as the Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura, and later served as the governor of the cities Terni, Rieti, Citta di Castello and Spoleto. He also served as the auditor of the Sacred Roman Rota.    Pope Innocent X appointed him to the cardinalate and in 1652 at the request of the Venetian government and he was made the Cardinal-Priest of San Salvatore in Lauro. He was appointed as Bishop of Brescia in 1654 and later received episcopal consecration in the church of San Marco in Rome. He would spend a quiet decade in his diocese. He opted to be Cardinal-Priest of San Marco in 1660 and resigned as Bishop of Brescia in 1664. Ottoboni also opted to become Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere in 1677 and later as Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prassede in 1680. He later became the Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina in 1681 and then to Frascati in 1683. His last swap was that of Porto e Santa Rufina in 1687. Ottoboni was also the Vice-Dean of the College of Cardinals from 1687 to his pontifical election.        The ambassador of King Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) succeeded in procuring his election on 6 October 1689, as the successor to Pope Innocent XI (1676–89); nevertheless, after months of negotiation Alexander VIII finally condemned the declaration made in 1682 by the French clergy concerning the liberties of the Gallican church.He chose the pontifical name of ""Alexander VIII"" in gratitude to Cardinal Flavio Chigi, the nephew of Pope Alexander VII, who also had helped support his candidacy. Ottoboni was crowned as pontiff on 16 October 1689 by the protodeacon Cardinal Francesco Maidalchini and took possession of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 28 October 1689. Old but of a strong constitution, Alexander VIII was said to be an able diplomat. During his brief pontificate he managed to destroy most of his predecessor's good work. All the money saved by Innocent XI was spent on enriching the Ottoboni family and to a cardinal he said: ""I have no time to lose; for me the day is almost done!""Alexander VIII was almost an octogenarian when elected to the papacy, which lasted only sixteen months, during which time little of importance was done. Louis XIV, whose political situation was now critical, profited by the peaceful dispositions of the new pope, restored Avignon to him, and renounced the long-abused right of asylum for the French Embassy.    Charities on a large scale and unbounded nepotism exhausted the papal treasury, reversing the policies of his predecessor. Among the various nominations, his 22-year-old grandnephew Pietro was made cardinal and vice-chancellor of the Church, nephew Marco, son of his brother Agostino, was made inspector of naval fortifications and Duke of Fiano, and nephew Antonio, another of Agostino's children, was made general of the church. His nephew Giovanni Rubin was made secretary of state and bishop of Vicenza. Out of compassion for the poor of the impoverished Papal States, he sought to help them by reducing taxes. But this same generous nature led him to bestow on his relations the riches they were eager to accumulate; on their behalf, and to the discredit of his pontificate, he revived sinecure offices which had been suppressed by Innocent XI. He bought the books and manuscripts of Queen Christina of Sweden for the Vatican Library. Alexander VIII assisted his native Venice by generous subsidies in the war against the Turks, as well as sending seven galleys and 2,000 infantry for the campaign in Albania.  In 1690 he condemned the doctrines of the so-called philosophical sin, taught in the Jesuit schools. He also held three consistories that saw 14 new cardinals elevated.    Alexander VIII confirmed the cultus of Kinga of Poland on 11 June 1690 which served as the beatification. On 16 October 1690, he canonized several saints: Ss. Pascal Baylon, Lorenzo Giustiniani, John of Sahagun, John of God and John of Capistrano.     The pope created 14 cardinals in three consistories and elevated individuals such as his grandnephew Pietro Ottoboni in a restoration of nepotism that had not been seen in his predecessor's reign.    Alexander VIII died on 1 February 1691. His grandiose tomb in St. Peter's was commissioned by his grandnephew, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, and designed by Count Arrigo di San Martino. The bas-relief at the base and the flanking figures (1704) were sculpted by Angelo de' Rossi, while the bronze statue of the pope was cast by Giuseppe Bertosi.

"Count Francesco Algarotti (11 December 1712 – 3 May 1764) was a Venetian polymath, philosopher, poet, essayist, anglophile, art critic and art collector. [SEP] He was a man of broad knowledge, an expert in Newtonianism, architecture and opera. He was a friend of Frederick the Great and leading authors of his times: Voltaire, Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens, Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis and the atheist Julien Offray de La Mettrie. Lord Chesterfield, Thomas Gray, George Lyttelton, Thomas Hollis, Metastasio, Benedict XIV and Heinrich von Brühl were among his correspondents.    Algarotti was born in Venice as the son of a rich merchant. His father and uncle were art collectors. Unlike his older brother Bonomo he did not step into the company, but decided to become an author. Francesco studied natural sciences and mathematics in Rome and Bologna under Francesco Maria Zanotti and in 1728 he experimented with optics. (Zanotti became a lifelong friend.) He was educated in his native Venice and in Rome and Bologna. His youthful curiosity led him to travel extensively, and he visited Paris for the first time in his early 20s. There his urbanity, his brilliant conversation, his good looks, and his versatile intelligence promptly made an impression on such intellectuals as Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Voltaire. Two years later he was in London, where he was made a fellow of the Royal Society. He became embroiled in a lively bisexual love-triangle with the politician John Hervey, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Algarotti left for Italy and finished his Neutonianismo per le dame (""Newtonism for Ladies"") (1737 – dedicated to Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle) – a work consisting of information on astronomy, physics, mathematics, women and science and education.    Algarotti had made acquaintance with Antiochus Kantemir, a Moldavian diplomat, poet and composer. He was invited to visit Russia for the wedding of Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick. In 1739 he left with Lord Baltimore from Sheerness to Newcastle upon Tyne. Because of a heavy storm the ship sheltered in Harlingen. Algarotti was discovering ""this new city"", which he called the great window ... to which Russia looks on Europe. Returning from Saint Petersburg, they visited Frederick the Great in Rheinsberg. Algarotti had obligations in England and came back the year after. Then Algarotti went together with Frederick to Königsberg where he was crowned.  Frederick, who was impressed with this walking encyclopedia, made him and his brother Bonomo Prussian counts in 1740. Algarotti accompanied Frederick to Bayreuth, Kehl, Strasbourg and Moyland Castle where they met with Voltaire, who was taking baths in Kleve for his health. In 1741 Algarotti went to Turin as his diplomat. Frederick had offered him a salary, but Algarotti refused. First, he went to Dresden and Venice, where he bought 21 paintings, a few by Jean-Étienne Liotard and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo for the court of Augustus III of Poland. Algarotti did not succeed in inducing the Kingdom of Sardinia to launch a treacherous attack upon Austria.     Algarotti's choice of works reflects the encyclopedic interests of the Neoclassic era; he was uninterested in developing a single unitary stylistic collection, and envisioned a modern museum, a catalog of styles from across the ages. For contemporary commissions, he wrote up a list of paintings he recommended commissioning, including history paintings from Tiepolo, Pittoni, and Piazzetta; scenes with animals from Castiglione, and veduta with ruins from Pannini. He wanted ""suggetti graziosi e leggeri"" from Balestra, Boucher, and Donato Creti. Other artists he supported were Giuseppe Nogari, Bernardo Bellotto, and Francesco Pavona. In 1747 Algarotti went back to Potsdam and became court chamberlain, but left to visit the archeological diggings at Herculaneum. In 1749 he moved to Berlin. Algarotti was  involved in finishing the architectural designs of Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff who had fallen ill. In February 1753, after several years residing in Prussia, he returned to Italy, living most of the time in Bologna. In 1759 Algarotti was involved in a new opera-style in the city of Parma. He influenced Guillaume du Tillot and the Duke of Parma.  Algarotti's Essay on the Opera (1755) was a major influence on the librettist Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni and the composer Tommaso Traetta, and in the development of Gluck's reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of opera seria, with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music, ballet or staging. The drama itself should ""delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense"". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist Calzabigi, writing their Orfeo ed Euridice.In 1762 Algarotti moved to Pisa, where he died of tuberculosis. Frederick the Great, who several times had needed Algarotti for writing texts in Latin, sent in a text for a monument to his memory on the Campo Santo.   "

"Andrew III the Venetian (Hungarian: III. Velencei András, Croatian: Andrija III. Mlečanin, Slovak: Ondrej III.; c. 1265 – 14 January 1301) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1290 and 1301. [SEP] His father, Stephen the Posthumous, was the posthumous son of Andrew II of Hungary although Stephen's brothers considered him a bastard. Andrew grew up in Venice, and first arrived in Hungary upon the invitation of a rebellious baron, Ivan Kőszegi, in 1278. Kőszegi tried to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary, but the conspiracy collapsed and Andrew returned to Venice. Being the last male member of the House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king after the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a coronation diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule. Hungary was in a state of constant anarchy during Andrew's reign. The Kőszegis, the Csáks, and other powerful families autonomously governed their domains, rising up nearly every year in open rebellion against Andrew. With Andrew's death, the House of Árpád became extinct. A civil war ensued which lasted for more than two decades and ended with the victory of Mary of Hungary's grandson, Charles Robert.    Andrew was the son of Stephen the Posthumous, the self-styled Duke of Slavonia, and his second wife, Tomasina Morosini. Andrew's father was born to Beatrice D'Este, the third wife of Andrew II of Hungary, after the king's death. However, Andrew II's two elder sons, Béla IV of Hungary and Coloman of Halych, accused Beatrice D'Este of adultery and refused to acknowledge Stephen the Posthumous as their legitimate brother. Andrew's mother, Tomasina Morosini, was the daughter of wealthy Venetian patrician Michele Morosini.The exact date of Andrew's birth is unknown. According to historians Tibor Almási, Gyula Kristó, and Attila Zsoldos, he was born in about 1265. Stephen the Posthumous nominated his wife's two kinsmen, including her brother Albertino Morosini, as Andrew's guardians before his death in 1272.     Andrew came to Hungary for the first time in 1278 at the invitation of a powerful lord, Ivan Kőszegi. Kőszegi wanted to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Andrew, who was the only male member of the royal family besides the king, adopted the title of ""Duke of Slavonia, Dalmatia and Croatia"" and marched as far as Lake Balaton. Andrew achieved nothing, however, and went back to Venice in autumn.Andrew returned to Hungary at the beginning of 1290. On this occasion, Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom, also urged him to come, since the archbishop wanted to dethrone the excommunicated Ladislaus IV with the assistance of Ivan Kőszegi. Before Andrew was successful, Arnold Hahót, an enemy of the Kőszegis, invited him to the fort of Štrigova and captured him. Hahót sent Andrew to Vienna, where Albert I, Duke of Austria, held him in captivity.Three Cuman assassins murdered Ladislaus IV on 10 July 1290, and Archbishop Lodomer subsequently dispatched two monks to Vienna to inform Andrew of the king's death. With the monks' assistance, Andrew left his prison in disguise and hastened to Hungary.       Upon Andrew's arrival, his opponents tried to bribe Theodore Tengerdi, Provost of the Székesfehérvár Chapter, not to hand over the Holy Crown of Hungary to the soon-to-be-king, but the prior refused them. Archbishop Lodomer crowned Andrew king in Székesfehérvár on 23 July. The lords and prelates swore loyalty to Andrew only after he issued a charter promising the restoration of internal peace and respect for the privileges of the nobility and the clergymen. He then appointed the most powerful noblemen, who had for years administered their domains independently of the monarch, to the highest offices. Amadeus Aba, who dominated the northeastern parts of the kingdom, was made palatine, Ivan Kőszegi, the lord of the western parts of Transdanubia, became master of the treasury, and Roland Borsa remained the voivode of Transylvania. Andrew held a diet before 1 September. To put an end to anarchy, the ""prelates, barons and noblemen"" ordered the destruction of castles which had been erected without royal permission and the restoration of estates that had been unlawfully seized to their rightful owners. Andrew promised that he would hold a diet each year during his reign.  There were several other challengers to Andrew's claim to the throne. Rudolf I of Germany claimed that Hungary escheated to him after Ladislaus IV's childless death, because Ladislaus IV's grandfather, Béla IV of Hungary, had sworn fidelity to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor during the Mongol invasion of Hungary. Although Pope Innocent IV had years before freed Béla IV of his oath, Rudolf I of Germany attempted to bestow Hungary on his own son, Albert of Austria, on 31 August. The self-declared ""Andrew, Duke of Slavonia""—an adventurer who claimed to be identical to Ladislaus IV's dead younger brother—also challenged King Andrew's right to the crown and stormed into Hungary from Poland. He was shortly thereafter forced to return to Poland, where he was murdered.Andrew married Fenenna, the daughter of Ziemomysł of Kuyavia, before the end of 1290. Andrew then held a general assembly for the barons and the noblemen of five counties to the east of the river Tisza—Bihar, Kraszna, Szabolcs, Szatmár, and Szolnok—at Nagyvárad (Oradea) in early 1291. The assembly outlawed Stephen Balogsemjén, a staunch supporter of the late Ladislaus IV, for major trespass. From the assembly, Andrew went to Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia). Here he issued the decrees of his 1290 diet at the assembly of the local noblemen, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians, in February or March. Around the same time, Andrew dismissed Amadeus Aba and made Ivan Kőszegi palatine.Ladislaus IV's sister Mary, wife of Charles II of Naples, announced her claim to the throne in April 1291. The Babonići, Frankopans, Šubići, and other leading Croatian and Slavonian noble families accepted her as the lawful monarch. Andrew's main concern, however, was Albert of Austria's claim. He invaded Austria, forcing Albert to withdraw his garrisons from the towns and fortresses—including Pressburg (Bratislava) and Sopron—that he had captured years before, many of which were held by the Kőszegis before their conquest. The Peace of Hainburg, which concluded the war, was signed on 26 August, and three days later Andrew and Albert of Austria confirmed it at their meeting in Köpcsény (Kopčany). The peace treaty prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert of Austria had seized from the Kőszegis. The Kőszegis rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292, acknowledging Mary's son, Charles Martel, as King of Hungary. The royal troops subdued the rebellion by July, but the Kőszegis captured and imprisoned Andrew during his journey to Slavonia in August. Andrew was liberated within four months, after his supporters sent their relatives as hostages to the Kőszegis.    Upon Andrew's request, his mother, Tomasina, moved to Hungary in 1293. Andrew appointed her to administer Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia. Due to her activities, the Babonići, Šubići, and the Dalmatian towns acknowledged Andrew's rule. Andrew visited the northern parts of Hungary and ordered the revision of former land grants in February. After his return to Buda, he again made Amadeus Aba palatine. In August, Andrew arranged a marriage between his cousin, Constance Morosini, and Vladislav, son of Stefan Dragutin of Serbia, who had earlier acknowledged Charles Martel's claim to Hungary.  Roland Borsa besieged and captured Benedict, Bishop of Várad's fortress at Fenes (Finiș) on 23 May 1294. Andrew held a general assembly and outlawed Borsa.  According to historian Attila Zsoldos, he made Nicholas Kőszegi palatine on this occasion. Andrew laid siege to Borsa's fort at Adorján (Adrian). The siege lasted three months before the fort fell to Andrew in October. Andrew replaced Roland Borsa with Ladislaus III Kán as voivode of Transylvania, but the former preserved all his domains in the lands east of the Tisza.The Croatian lord Paul Šubić again turned against Andrew and joined the camp of Charles Martel in early 1295, but Charles died in August. Within two months, the Babonići also rebelled against Andrew. Early the next year, the recently widowed King Andrew visited Vienna and arranged a marriage with Duke Albert's daughter Agnes. The Kőszegis soon rose up in open rebellion. Andrew declared war on the rebels, and Archbishop Lodomer excommunicated them. Andrew and Albert jointly seized the Kőszegis' main fort at Kőszeg in October, but could not subdue them. Andrew's mother seems to have died at the end of the year because references to her activities disappear from the contemporaneous documents.Matthew III Csák, whom Andrew had made palatine in 1296, turned against Andrew at the end of 1297. Andrew's staunch supporter, Archbishop Lodomer, died around the same time. In early February 1298, Andrew visited Albert of Austria in Vienna and promised to support him against Adolf of Nassau, King of Germany. Andrew sent an auxiliary troop, and Albert of Austria routed King Adolf in the Battle of Göllheim on 2 July.     Andrew held an assembly of the prelates, noblemen, Saxons, Székelys, and Cumans in Pest in the summer of 1298. The preamble to the decrees that were passed at the diet mentioned ""the laxity of the lord king"". The decrees authorized Andrew to destroy forts built without permission and ordered the punishment of those who had seized landed property with force, but also threatened Andrew with excommunication if he did not apply the decrees. At the gathering, he appointed his uncle, Albertino Morosini, Duke of Slavonia. After the close of the diet, Andrew entered into a formal alliance with five influential noblemen – Amadeus Aba, Stephen Ákos, Dominic Rátót, Demetrius Balassa and Paul Szécs – who stated that they were willing to support him against the Pope and the bishops. Gregory Bicskei, the Archbishop-elect and Apostolic Administrator of Esztergom, forbade the prelates to participate at a new diet which was held in 1299. The prelates ignored the archbishop's order and Andrew deprived him of Esztergom County.A group of powerful lords—including the Šubići, Kőszegis and Csáks—urged Charles II of Naples to send his grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary in order to become king. The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300. Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb. The Kőszegis and Matthew Csák, however, were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Andrew's envoy to the Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert's adventure, either. Andrew, who had been in poor health for a while, was planning to capture his opponent, but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301. According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Kristó, the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved.Andrew was buried in the Franciscan church in Buda. Years later, Palatine Stephen Ákos referred to Andrew as the ""last golden branch"" of the tree of King Saint Stephen's family, because with Andrew's death the House of Árpád, the first royal dynasty of Hungary, ended. A civil war between various claimants to the throne—Charles Robert, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and Otto of Bavaria—followed Andrew's death and lasted for seven years. The civil war ended with Charles Robert's victory, but he was forced to continue fighting against the Kőszegis, the Abas, Matthew Csák, and other powerful lords up to the early 1320s.     Andrew's first wife, Fenenna of Kuyavia (d. 1295), gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1291 or 1292. Elizabeth became engaged to Wenceslaus, the heir to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, in 1298, but the betrothal was broken in 1305. She joined the Dominican convent at Töss where she died a nun on 5 May 1338. She is now venerated as Blessed Elizabeth of Töss. Andrew's second wife, Agnes of Austria, was born in 1280. She survived her husband, but did not marry again; she died in the Königsfelden Monastery of the Poor Clares in 1364.   "
"Giuseppe Angeli (Venice 1709- Venice, 1798) was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque, known for depicting both genre and religious subjects.

In 1756, he began as an instructor at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice; in 1772, he became president of the Academy. He is known for two canvases in the church of San Stae and for fresco murals at the Villa Widmann-Foscari at Mira, near Padua. His other works include an Immaculate Conception with Saints (ca1760) moved to sacristy of San Francesco della Vigna; two scenes of the Via Crucis for the church of Santa Maria Zobenigo; the altarpiece of St Pietro I Orseolo receives the monk's habit from St Romuald in the church of Santa Maria della Pietà; an Immaculate Conception with Saints in the basilica of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari; an Ecstasy of St Francis in the Sanctuary of the Madonna del Pilastrello at Lendinara; an Apparition of the Virgin to St Simon Stock at the church of Santa Maria Maddalena; the frescoes in the salone of Villa Giovanelli Colonna at Noventa Padovana, a ceiling in the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, and in the Palazzo Barbaro-Curtis in Venice; and a painting of a Soldato con tamburo in the Louvre.

For a number of years he studied under Corona, and on the death of that painter completed several works left unfinished by him. His own activity seems to have been confined to the production of pieces for several of the churches and a few private houses in Venice, and the old guide-books and descriptions of the city notice a considerable number of paintings by him.

"René-Louis de Voyer de Paulmy, Marquis d'Argenson (18 October 1694 – 26 January 1757) was a politician and friend of Voltaire, who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from November 1744 to January 1747. [SEP] His younger brother, Marc-Pierre, Comte d'Argenson (1696-1764), was Minister of War from 1743 to 1747.    René-Louis de Voyer de Paulmy was born 18 October 1694, eldest son of Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1652-1721) and Marguerite Le Fèvre de Caumartin (1672-1719). He had a younger brother, Marc-Pierre, Comte d'Argenson (1696-1764), who served as Minister of War from 1743 to 1747. His father was Lieutenant General of Police and Controller-General of Finances, one of the most important positions in the Ancien Régime. He was a member of the Noblesse de robe or Nobles of the robe, a class that formed the Second Estate whose rank derived from holding judicial or administrative posts. They were usually hard-working professionals, unlike the aristocratic Noblesse d'épée or Nobles of the Sword. His grandfather and great-grandfather both served as French ambassador to the Republic of Venice.    D'Argenson qualified as a lawyer, and held successively the posts of councillor at the Parlement (1716), maître des requêtes (1718), councillor of state (1719), and Intendant of justice, police and finance in Hainaut. During his five years’ tenure of the last office he was mainly employed in provisioning the troops, who were suffering from the economic confusion resulting from John Law's system and the aftermath of the Mississippi Bubble.D'Argenson returned to court in 1724 to exercise his functions as councillor of state. At that time he had the reputation of being a conscientious man, but ill-adapted to intrigue, and was nicknamed ""la bête"". He entered into relations with the philosophers, and was won over to the ideas of reform. He was the friend of Voltaire, who had been a fellow-student of his at the Jesuit college Louis-le-Grand, and frequented the Club de l'Entresol, the history of which he wrote in his memoirs. It was then that he prepared his Considérations sur le gouvernement de la France, which was published posthumously by his son.D'Argenson was also the friend and counsellor of the minister Germain Louis Chauvelin. In May 1744 he was appointed member of the council of finance, and in November of the same year King Louis XV chose him as secretary of state for foreign affairs, his brother, Marc-Pierre, Comte d'Argenson, being at the same time secretary of state for war. France was at that time engaged in the War of the Austrian Succession, and the government had been placed by Louis XV virtually in the hands of the two brothers. The marquis d’Argenson endeavoured to reform the system of international relations. He dreamed of a ""European Republic"", and wished to establish arbitration between nations in pursuance of the ideas of his friend the abbé de Saint-Pierre. But he failed to realize any part of his projects. The generals negotiated in opposition to his instructions; his colleagues laid the blame on him; the intrigues of the courtiers passed unnoticed by him; whilst the secret diplomacy of the king neutralized his initiative. He concluded the marriage of the Louis, the Dauphin to  Maria, a daughter of King Augustus III of Poland, but was unable to prevent the election of the Francis, Grand-Duke of Tuscany as Holy Roman Emperor in 1745.On 10 January 1747 Louis XV thanked d'Argenson for his services. He then retired into private life, eschewed the court, associated with Voltaire, Condillac and d’Alembert, and spent his declining years in working at the Académie des Inscriptions, of which he was appointed president by the king in 1747, and revising his Mémoires. Voltaire, in one of his letters, declared him to be ""the best citizen that had ever tasted the ministry"". He died on 26 January 1757.   "
"Giovanna Baccelli, real name Giovanna Francesca Antonia Giuseppe Zanerini, (1753–1801) was a Venetian ballerina who was the principal ballerina at the King's Theatre, Haymarket.    Giovanna Baccelli was born Giovanna Francesca Antonia Giuseppe Zanerini in Venice in 1753. She took her mother's name of Baccelli as her stage name.    She was the principal ballerina at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. She was the mistress of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. Dorset commissioned a painting of her (above) in 1780–81 from Thomas Gainsborough, which is considered to be one of Gainsborough's later masterpieces.  He also commissioned a painting by Joshua Reynolds and a sculpture showing her nude and prone on a divan and cushions; this is still to be found at Knole. When made Ambassador to France, Dorset even took her to Paris with him, and she danced at the Opera by invitation.

"Jean Antoine de Baïf (19 February 1532 – 19 September 1589) was a French poet and member of the Pléiade. [SEP]    He was born in Venice, the natural son of the scholar Lazare de Baïf, who was at that time French ambassador at Venice. Thanks, perhaps, to the surroundings of his childhood, he grew up an enthusiast for the fine arts, and surpassed in zeal all the leaders of the Renaissance in France. His father spared no pains to secure the best possible education for his son. The boy was taught Latin by Charles Estienne, and Greek by Ange Vergèce, the Cretan scholar and calligraphist who designed Greek types for Francis I. When he was eleven years old he was put under the care of the famous Jean Daurat. Ronsard, who was eight years his senior, now began to share his studies. Claude Binet tells how young Baïf, bred on Latin and Greek, smoothed out the tiresome beginnings of the Greek language for Ronsard, who in return initiated his companion into the mysteries of French versification. Baïf possessed an extraordinary facility, and the mass of his work has injured his reputation. Besides a number of volumes of short poems of an amorous or congratulatory kind, he translated or paraphrased various pieces from Bion of Smyrna, Moschus, Theocritus, Anacreon, Catullus and Martial. He resided in Paris, and enjoyed the continued favor of the court. In 1570, in conjunction with the composer Joachim Thibault de Courville, with royal blessing and financial backing, he founded the Académie de Poésie et de Musique, with the idea of establishing a closer union between music and poetry; his house became famous for the concerts which he gave, entertainments which Charles IX and Henry III frequently attended.  Composers such as Claude Le Jeune, who was to become the most influential musician in France in the late 16th century, and Jacques Mauduit, who carried the Academie's ideas into the 17th century, soon joined the group, which remained secretive as to its intents and techniques.

"Adriano Balbi (April 25, 1782 – March 14, 1848), Italian geographer, was born at Venice. [SEP] The publication of his Prospetto politico-geografico dello stato attuale del globo (Venice, 1808) obtained his election to the chair of professor of geography at the college of San Michele at Murano; in 1811–1813 he was professor of physics at the Lyceum of Fermo, and afterwards became attached to the customs office at his native city.In 1820 he visited Portugal, and there collected materials for his Essai statistique sur le royaume de Portugal et d’Algarve, published in 1822 at Paris, where the author resided from 1821 until 1832. This was followed by Variétés politiques et statistiques de la monarchie portugaise, which contains some observations respecting that country under the Roman sway. In 1826 he published the first volume of his Atlas ethnographique du globe, ou classification des peuples anciens et modernes d’après leurs langues, a work of great erudition. In 1829 he published, with Andre-Michel Guerry, Statistique comparée de l'état de l'instruction et du nombre des crimes dans les divers arrondissements des Académies et des Cours Royales de France, the first comparative choropleth map showing crime in relation to level of instruction.In 1832 appeared the Abrégé de Geographie, which, in an enlarged form, was translated. into the principal languages of Europe. Balbi retired to Padua and there died in 1848.His son, Eugenio Balbi (1812–1884), followed a similar career, being professor of geography at Pavia, and publishing his father's Scritti Geografici (Turin, 1841), and original works in Gea, ossia la terra (Trieste, 1854–1867) and Saggio di geografia (Milan, 1868).

"Gasparo Balbi was an Italian jeweller, merchant, and author from Venice, who is best known for his account of his travels to India and the East from 1579–1588. [SEP] He mainly travelled with Portuguese merchant and naval vessels and to forts and trading posts owned by or friendly to that country's commerce. His story, published in 1590 in Venice, was titled Voyage to the Oriental Indies.    His travels began in Cyprus, whence he moved to Aleppo, then to Babylon and Basra, and finally to the Portuguese fort of Hormuz. From there, he embarked over water past the Portuguese fort of Dibba (Debe), to the post at Diu, from there to Daman and then to the walled city of Chiauul (Chaul), then Goa, then Cocchi, through Cananor (Cannanore) and Onor. He then went to Negapatan (Nagapattinam), then to San Thome and then to Pegu. He then visited Dala, Dogon and the ruins of Sirian (Syriam), Meccao, and Silon. He went then to Maraban, Malacca. and from there to Cocchi (Kingdom of Cochin). He visited the Portuguese fortress of Colombo in Seilan (Ceylon, now Sri Lanka). He returned via Hormuz, Basra, and Babylon.    He visited the temple of Alefanta (Elephanta Caves) near what is today Bombay, and attributed its construction to Alexander the Great, in the same way later European visitors to the Taj Mahal in past centuries attributed the structure to European visitors. The ships on which he traveled had to fight off corsairs from the Malabar Coast. There is little analysis or confession in the account; the account is often a dry businessman's succinct observations of places and their contents. As a merchant at heart discussing the mechanics of trade, he details the various exchange rates for coins in Basra, Goa and Negapatan including silver Serafini (Xerafims), Venetian Liri, and Gold Zecchini. He describes how merchants used the abacus for calculations, and their units of measurement. In Cocchi, he was able to see the arrival of a merchant ship from China, and was able to discuss the coins used by merchants in Malacca, and the emperor-sponsored preaching of Christianity by the Jesuits in China.Near San Thome and other sites in India, he observed on the rites of suttee. In Negapatan he watched the funeral rites for the king, including when women of his harem and some of his subjects willingly threw themselves and died under the wheels of a funeral carriage procession. He also had numerous observations on Hindu rites. He describes people drowning themselves in the Ganges to gain paradise. He claims Brahmin priests in Cochin can exert licentiousness with woman in the province, rich or poor, married or single.Yet his account, often cursory, seems stress the barbarity of the place, and his abhorrence of non-Christian religions, often deriding them as devil-worship. He finds as much to fear from man as from animals. He noted frequently the danger from man-eating tigers. In the Andaman islands, they stop off on an island named Carnalcubar, which they say is populated by savage cannibals.He describes the four white elephants kept by the king of Pegù. He also describes how they catch and domesticate wild elephants. He described their marriage ceremonies,. and festivities. He described the harsh physical punishments, including castration, for different immoral offences. He also described that he witnessed the king of Pegu, after a war, put four thousand inhabitants, men, women, and children, of a town to death by fire. He states he watched it with great compassion and my pain, seeing young blameless angels suffer martyrdom. In another anecdote, in 1583, Nadabayin, then king of Pegu, inquired from Balbi, as to who was the king of Venice. Balbi replied, there was no king, and that it is governed as a republic and not dominated by any king, taken by such a great marvel this king, began to laugh in such fashion that he was overcome with coughing and he said it gave him great displeasure (for me) to have such said to great persons like him.While Marco Polo's travels were, by then, centuries old; Balbi's commentary is generally contemporary with travels by the fellow-Venetian Niccolò de' Conti and Cesare Federici. The Genoese Hieronymo di San Stefano and Varthema of Bologna, occurred at the beginning of the 16th century. The more eloquent tale of Gemelli Careri in Giro del Mondo would be over a century later.   "
"Hieronymus Balbus (also called Girolamo Balbi or Accellini) was a Renaissance Humanist, poet, diplomat, and Bishop of Gurk in Carinthia, b. about 1450 in Venice; d. there, probably 1535. [SEP] He was a pupil of Julius Pomponius Laetus, the founder of the Roman Academy.  As a young man, he was reportedly of a quarrelsome disposition, and, for a time, led a very loose life. But in later years he was highly respected and came to be regarded as one of the most accomplished men of his day. In 1485 he was professor at the University of Paris. His overbearing manner here soon brought him into conflict with various scholars, and in consequence of the attack which these men made on his character, he was obliged to leave Paris in 1491. A few years later (1494), at the invitation of Emperor Maximilian I, he went to the University of Vienna, where he lectured on poetry, the Roman classics, and jurisprudence. He was again in Paris, for a short period, in 1495, and visited London in 1496, but resumed his professorship in Vienna in 1497. Here he became a member of the Danube Society, and lived on terms of close friendship with its founder, Conrad Celtes the Humanist, at that time professor and librarian at the University of Vienna. In little less than a year, renewed contentions with his colleagues forced him to quit Vienna. Balbus next went to Prague (1498), where he accepted a professorship that had been obtained for him by his Viennese friends. But his irregular conduct, scandalous writings, and disputatious temper soon drove him from the city. On leaving Prague he withdrew to Hungary (Pécs), and remained in retirement for a period of fifteen years, during which time he changed his manner of life completely, and even took religious orders. His subsequent career as an ecclesiastic was one of considerable distinction. He became provost of the Cathedral Chapter in Waizen, 1515, later also of that in Bratislava, and, for some years, held an important position at the Court of Hungary, where he was a tutor of the royal princes, and private secretary to the king, Ladislaus VI. In 1521 Balbus appeared at the Diet of Worms as the ambassador of Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia, and attracted considerable attention by a discourse in which he protested against the innovations of Martin Luther, and urged upon the assembled princes the necessity of a joint undertaking against the Turks. Shortly afterward he was in the service of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, who, in 1522, designated him Bishop of Gurk, and sent him to Rome on a congratulatory embassy to the newly elected pontiff, Adrian VI. It was a part of his mission also to induce the pope to proclaim a crusade against Turkey. The address which he made on being received by the pope in a public audience, 9 February 1523, was well received in humanistic circles as a marvel of eloquence. Balbus remained in Rome for some time and was there consecrated Bishop of Gurk, 25 March 1523. As a bishop, he was frequently absent from his diocese. From one of his letters, we learn that in the time of Clement VII he lived in Rome for some years in the papal palace and was much in the confidence of that pontiff. In 1530, though quite an old man, he accompanied Emperor Charles V to Bologna to attend the emperor's coronation. At Bologna he wrote his best-known work, De coronatione principum, which, on account of the views it contains on the relation of Church and State, was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, 23 July 1611. Balbus was the author of many other works, including poetical, oratorical, and politico-moral writings which were edited by Joseph von Retzer (Vienna, 1791–92, 2 vols.).   "
"Vittorio Baldini (died 21 February 1618) was an Italian printer and engraver. [SEP] He started publishing in Venice, where he was born, and later moved to Ferrara, joining the court of Duke Alfonso II d'Este in mid-to-late 1582, where he was the official ducal music printer. He may have met the duke through Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, whose translation and commentary on Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico Baldini printed in early 1582.His first work as ducal music printer, and indeed his first print of music, was an anthology of madrigals, Il lauro secco (1582), written by the most renowned composers of Rome and Northern Italy, as well as introducing important new composers, and was inspired by Laura Peverara. He later printed the anthology Il lauro verde (1583), meant as a companion to Il lauro secco, and presented to Peverara on the occasion of her marriage in late February 1583.Baldini published very little music for Alfonso between 1586 and 1594, and began publishing regularly again 1594-1596, when he printed anthologies containing madrigals by some of the most important madrigalists of the seconda pratica, including  Luzzasco Luzzaschi, Carlo Gesualdo, and Alfonso Fontanelli, all of whom were part of the Este court at the time. These books, however, may have been funded by Gesualdo, who was at the court for his marriage to Leonora d'Este. During the period Baldini printed little for Alfonso; he did print a number of treatises on music and art, including those by Giovanni Battista Aleotti and Ercole Bottrigari. After Ferrara devolved to the papacy, Baldini published under the imprint of ""Episcopal or State Printer and Printer to the Academy of the Intrepidi."" During this period he printed descriptions and texts for various intermezzos and other theatrical entertainments. Baldini's works are set apart by the beauty of the lettering, the finery of their engraving, beautiful title pages, and high quality paper. He used a number of signs, including a bell, Daedalus, and the sun.

"Niccolò Bambini (1651–1736) was an Italian painter of the late-Renaissance and early-Baroque periods. [SEP]    He was born in Venice in 1651, and first studied under Giulio Mazzoni at Venice. To this period belong the ceiling of the church of S. Moisè, in a poor state of preservation, and an Allegory of Venice in the hall of the Four Doors of the ducal Palace. Later went to Rome, where he became a pupil of Carlo Maratti. On his return to his homeland, seeing that the whole world was running after the paintings of Liberi, he also followed that beautiful way of painting. An example of his imitations from Liberi is the allegorical ceiling of Ca 'Pesaro (1682). While The Nativity of the Virgin in the church of San Stefano, according to Zanetti, was ""conducted following the style of the art school of Rome"". However, this painting of porcelain colors and pungent design, however, represented an isolated case. Usually Roman memories are reduced in his paintings to some generic motifs typical of the Maratta's followers. Among his best works are The Adoration of the Magi in St.Zaccaria in Venice, painted in competition with A. Balestra, as well as the decoration of the library hall of the bishop's palace in Udine (1709). In his last period, he approached Sebastiano Ricci so much to be almost confused with him, as in the allegorical compartment with Minerva who Crowns Titus Livius in the ceiling of the library of the patriarchal seminary of Venice. For this reason it cannot be excluded that some works that considered of Ricci's youthful period belong to Nicolo Bambini, especially from the Parma group. He died in Venice. He had two sons who were painters, Giovanni and Stefano.   "
"Jacomo Barbarigo was a Venetian commentator and also the provveditore of Morea. [SEP] During the 15th century, he wrote a series of dispatches pertaining to the military events that transpired in the Peloponnesus. These letters were written between 1465 and 1466."
"Daniele Matteo Alvise Barbaro (also Barbarus) (8 February 1514 – 13 April 1570) was an Italian architect, writer on architecture, and translator of, and commentator on, Vitruvius. [SEP] He also had a significant ecclesiastical career. Barbaro's fame is chiefly due to his vast output in the arts, letters, and mathematics. A cultured humanist, he was a friend and admirer of Torquato Tasso, a patron of Andrea Palladio, and a student of Pietro Bembo. Francesco Sansovino considered Daniele to be one of the three best Venetian architects, along with Palladio and Francesco's father Jacopo.    He was born in Venice, the son of Francesco di Daniele Barbaro and Elena Pisani, daughter of the banker Alvise Pisani and Cecilia Giustinian. Barbaro studied philosophy, mathematics, and optics at the University of Padua.  He has been credited with the design of the university's botanical garden.Barbaro served the Republic of Venice as ambassador to the court of  Edward VI in London and as representative at the Council of Trent. In 1561 Pope Pius IV appointed him a cardinal in pectore, that is, secretly, to avoid causing diplomatic complications, but since Pius never made the appointment public Barbaro was never a cardinal. In 1550 he was elected Patriarch of Aquileia, an ecclesiastical appointment that required the approval of the Venetian Senate.  On the death of his father, he inherited a country estate with his brother Marcantonio Barbaro. They commissioned Palladio to design their shared country home Villa Barbaro, which is now part of a World Heritage Site. Palladio and Barbaro visited Rome together and the architecture of the villa reflects their interest in the ancient buildings they saw there. The interior of the villa is decorated with frescoes by Paolo Veronese, who also painted oil portraits of Daniele; one reproduced in this article shows him dressed as a Venetian aristocrat, the other shows him in clerical dress.Barbaro died in Udine. His will refers to his collection of purchased and constructed astronomical instruments. Daniele renounced his inheritance in favor of his brother Marcantonio and was buried in an unmarked grave behind the Church of San Francesco della Vigna instead of the family chapel there. Daniele commissioned the church's altarpiece of The Baptism of Christ (c. 1555) by Battista Franco.   "
"Ermolao or Hermolao Barbaro, also Hermolaus Barbarus (21 May 1454 – 14 June 1493), was an Italian Renaissance scholar. [SEP]    Ermolao Barbaro was born in Venice, the son of Zaccaria Barbaro, and the grandson of Francesco Barbaro. He was also the uncle of Daniele Barbaro and Marcantonio Barbaro Much of his early education was outside of Venice, accompanying his father who was an active politician and diplomat. He received further education in Verona with an uncle, also named Ermolao. In 1462 he was sent to Rome, where he studied under Pomponius Laetus and Theodorus Gaza.  By 1468 he had returned to Verona, where Frederick III awarded him a laurel crown for his poetry.He completed his education at the University of Padua, where he was appointed professor of philosophy there in 1477. Two years later he revisited Venice, but returned to Padua when the plague broke out in his native city.    Barbaro had an active political career, though he resented these duties as a distraction from his studies.  In 1483 he was elected to the Senate of the Republic of Venice.  He was twenty when he gave the funeral oration for Doge Nicholas Marcello.  In 1486, he was sent to the court of the Duchy of Burgundy in Bruges.  In 1488 he held the important civil post of Savio di Terrafirma.  In 1489 he was appointed ambassador to Milan and in 1490 he was appointed Ambassador to Rome.  In 1491, Pope Innocent VIII, nominated him to the office of Patriarch of Aquileia.  It was illegal under Venetian law for ambassadors to accept gifts or positions of foreign heads of state.  There was also a dispute between Venice and the Papacy as to who should nominate Patriarchs of Aquileia. Barbaro was accused of treason and the Venetian Senate ordered him to refuse the position. Pope Innocent and his successor Alexander VI threatened to excommunicate Barbaro if he resigned as Patriarch of Aquileia.The Venetian Senate revoked Barbaro's appointment as ambassador and exiled him from Venice. They threatened the same for his father, Zaccaria, as well as confiscation of both men's property, but Zaccaria died shortly afterwards.Barbaro then lived in a Roman villa on the Pincian Hill belonging to his brothers Daniele and Ludovico.  He died there of the plague in 1493 and was buried at the church of Santa Maria del Popolo. Ferdinando Ughelli mentions an inscription to Barbaro there, but it was lost by 1758.  Valeriano wrote a tribute to Barbaro.   "
"Francesco Barbaro (March 16, 1546 in Venice – April 27, 1616 in Udine) was a Venetian diplomat and an Italian Catholic bishop He was the great-grandson of Francesco Barbaro and son of Marcantonio Barbaro. [SEP] From 1578 to 1581 he was ambassador at the court of Savoy. He served as Ambassador to Florence in 1585.When the Patriarch of Aquileia, Giovanni Grimani, asked Pope Sixtus V for an assistant, the Pope chose Francisco Barbaro for his experience in politics and diplomacy. On October 17, 1585, Barbaro was consecrated as the titular Archbishop of Tyre. On 3 October 1593, Grimani died and Francesco Barbaro was officially named to replace him, as Patriarch of Aquileia.In 1595 Barbaro opened the diocesan synod in the Castello di San Daniele. This synod was marked by conflict between the canons of Udine and Cividale over which of two locations was the most important. Barbaro decided that precedent supported Udine; the clerics of Cividale protested. In the same year Francesco asked Pope Clement VIII to appoint his younger brother Ermolao Barbaro as his coadjutor.  On February 12, 1596 the Pope appointed Ermolao Barbaro as archbishop of Tyre. Francesco supported the Roman Rite of Pius V over the older Aquileian Rite. He persuaded Udine to adopt the Roman Rite at the provincial synod held on October 19–27, 1596. Barbaro did the same on 11 May 1600 at the provincial synod of Cividale and on 23 June 1602 with that of Gorizia. Patriarch Francesco had a new Patriarchal Palace built in Udine and a new seminary for clerics. Until that time the residence of the patriarchs had been on top of the hill, but as the Republic of Venice wanted to build a fortress there. Statues of the previous Patriarchs were set up in the new building and Barbaro donated his personal library. He is buried in the church of Sant 'Antonio Abate di Udine, along with his brother who succeeded him to lead the Patriarchate under the name of Ermolao Barbaro II.   "
"Francesco Barbaro (1390–1454) was an Italian politician, diplomat, and humanist from Venice and a member of the patrician Barbaro family. [SEP] He is interred in the Church of the Frari, Venice.    Francesco Barbaro was the son of Candiano Barbaro, uncle of Ermolao Barbaro, grandfather of the younger Ermolao Barbaro, and great-great grandfather of Marcantonio Barbaro and Daniele Barbaro. Francesco's father died in 1391 and Francesco was raised by his older brother Zaccaria. In 1419, Franceso married Maria Loredan, daughter of Procurator Pietro Loredan. Francesco and Maria had five daughters and one son, Zaccaria, who was born in 1422.    Francesco Barbaro was a student at the University of Padua and studied under John of Ravenna, Gasparino Barzizza, Vittorino da Feltre, Guarino Veronese, and Giovanni Conversini.    In 1419, Barbaro was appointed senator of the Republic of Venice. He was elected governor of Como in 1421, though he declined the post. Later that year he accepted the governorship of Trivigi. He served as governor of Vicenza in 1423, of Bergamo in 1430, and of Verona in 1434.In 1426 Barbaro was sent as a special envoy to the Papal Court to try to persuade Pope Martin V to ally with Venice against Milan. In 1428, the Pope assembled a congress at Ferrara, which ended the war, with Francesco Barbaro being one of Venice’s representatives there. That year Barbaro also served as ambassador in Ferrara and Florence. In 1433, Barbaro represented Venice at the court Emperor Sigismund in Bohemia, where he and the other envoys were knighted by the Emperor. At Emperor Sigismund’s request, Francesco Barbaro attempted to soothe relations between the Emperor and the Hussites. Eugenius IV also employed Barbaro in his negotiations with the Emperor.Barbaro served as Venetian ambassador to Mantua in 1443, Ferrara in 1444, and Milan in 1446.As governor of Brescia, from 1437 to 1440, Francesco Barbaro was able to reconcile the two rival factions of Avogadri and Martinenghi and he attained a great reputation in his defense of the city against the forces of the Duke of Milan, led by Niccolò Piccinino. Barbaro's success was commemorated by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo in his painting The Glorification of the Barbaro Family.Barbaro was governor of Verona again in 1441, and later was appointed governor of Padua and Governor General of Friuli in 1445. In 1444 he arbitrated a border dispute between the cities of Verona and Vicenza. He finally returned to Venice as a state councilor and was elected Procurator of St Mark's in 1452. Francesco Barbaro also served as Luogotenente of Friuli from 1448 to 1449.In 1453, Barbaro's friend, Filippo da Rimini, serving as chancellor of Venetian Corfu, sent him an account of the fall of Constantinople. When Barbaro died the following year, da Rimini delivered a funeral oration.    Barbaro engaged in research, collection and translation of ancient manuscripts and served as a patron to George of Trebizond and Flavio Biondo.Early in his career, he translated two of Plutarch’s Lives, those of Aristides and Cato from Greek texts into Latin and dedicated them to his older brother Zaccaria.He wrote a treatise on marriage, De re uxoria, in 1415 to celebrate the marriage of Lorenzo de' Medici and Ginevra Cavalcanti. It was inspired by ancient Latin and Greek sources, and he wrote it in just 25 days. In 1513, the treatise was published in Paris by Badius Ascensius, a transcription having been made in Verona by André Tiraqueau at the house of Guarino Veronese. A French translation was made by Martin du Pin in 1537. The work was translated into Italian by Alberto Lollio in 1548. The Latin version was reprinted in Paris in 1560 and again in Amsterdam in 1639. In 1667, another French translation was made by Claude Joly under the title L'Etat du Marriage. Another Italian translation was made in 1785 as A Scelta Della Moglie.Some of his letters and speeches were published for the first time in Brescia in 1728 under the title of Evangelistae Manelmi Vicentini Commentariorum de Obsidione Brixiae ann. 1438. Among the people he corresponded with were Alberto da Sarteano, Guarino Guarini, and Ludovico Trevisan. Many of his letters were published by Bernard Pez in Brescia in 1753. He may have been the author of a history of the Siege of Brescia.   "
"Marcantonio Barbaro (1518–1595) was an Italian diplomat of the Republic of Venice. [SEP]    He was born in Venice into the aristocratic Barbaro family. His father was Francesco di Daniele Barbaro and his mother Elena Pisani, daughter of the banker Alvise Pisani and Cecilia Giustinian. Barbaro married Giustina Giustiniani in 1534 and they had four sons, one of which, Francesco, became Patriarch of Aquileia, and another, Alvise, married a daughter of Jacopo Foscarini.On the death of Francesco Barbaro, Marcantonio and his elder brother Daniele Barbaro jointly inherited a country estate at Maser. There was already a house on the estate, but the brothers replaced it with a new house designed for them by the architect Palladio; this Villa Barbaro is now preserved as part of the World Heritage Site ""City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto"". The brothers probably had some input in the design of the building.  Daniele was a published author whose interests included architecture. Marcantonio Barbaro was an amateur sculptor, and seems to have focused mainly on the garden of the new house (in particular, a water feature, the nymphaeum).Towards the end of Palladio's life, Marcantonio commissioned him to design a circular chapel, the Tempietto, to serve the Maser estate, and he personally supervised its construction. However, Marcantonio was not buried at Maser, but rather in the family chapel in San Francesco della Vigna in Venice.    Marcantonio was educated at the University of Padua.  In the 1590s he was to return to the university as its Rector. Galileo was teaching there at the same time.In 1560, he held the office of Savio di Terraferma. He served as ambassador to France from 1561-64. and later served as bailo of Constantinople, i.e. ambassador to the Sublime Porte (Ottoman Empire) from 1568–73 and again in 1574. Barbaro negotiated a peace treaty in the aftermath of his country's loss of Cyprus in 1571 and the Battle of Lepanto later the same year. In 1583, he was instructed by the Senate to map the Friulan frontier to avoid border disputes. In 1593 he was finally authorized to begin fortification of the area. He was involved in the development of the fortress town of Palmanova. Barbaro was a candidate for Doge of Venice in 1570, 1578, 1585, and 1595.Barbaro used his position as a senator to influence public architecture in Venice. In 1558 he and his brother Daniele supported Palladio's design for a new façade for the Cathedral of San Pietro di Castello. Palladio’s project for rebuilding the Doge's Palace after a fire was rejected despite Barbaro's support.  However, Palladio’s design for the church of the Redentore was approved by the senate.After Palladio’s death, Barbaro transferred his support to Vincenzo Scamozzi. In 1587 he supported Scamozzi's design for a triple-arched Rialto Bridge, though Antonio da Ponte’s design for a single-arched bridge was chosen instead, and was one of three Venetian noblemen appointed to oversee the rebuilding of the bridge.Marcantonio was an early pioneer of Jewish rights within the Republic of Venice. He played an instrumental role in acceptance of Solomon of Udine, Turkish ambassador to Venice, at the Doge's Palace.   "

"Jacopo de' Barbari, sometimes known or referred to as de'Barbari, de Barberi, de Barbari, Barbaro, Barberino, Barbarigo or Barberigo (c. 1460/70 – before 1516), was an Italian painter and printmaker with a highly individual style. [SEP] He moved from Venice to Germany in 1500, thus becoming the first Italian Renaissance artist of stature to work in Northern Europe. His few surviving paintings (about twelve) include the first known example of trompe l'oeil since antiquity. His twenty-nine engravings and three very large woodcuts were also highly influential.    His place and date of birth are unknown, but he was described as a Venetian by contemporaries, including Albrecht Dürer (""van Venedig geporn""), and as 'old and weak' in 1511, so dates of between 1450 and 1470 have been proposed. Since the earlier part of the range would have him achieve sudden prominence at the age of nearly fifty, the later part would seem more likely. There have also been suggestions he was of German extraction; but it now seems clear he was Italian; there are surviving documents of his in Italian addressed to Germans. He signed most of his engravings with a caduceus, the sign of Mercury, and the Munich Still-Life with Partridge and Gauntlets (right) with this below his name: ""Jac.o de barbarj p 1504"" on the painted piece of paper. He was probably not of the important Venetian Barbaro family as he was never listed in that family's genealogy. Nothing is known about his first decades, although Alvise Vivarini has been suggested as his master. He left Venice for Germany in 1500, and thereafter is better documented. There he worked for the Emperor Maximilian I in Nuremberg for a year, then in various places for Frederick the Wise of Saxony in 1503–5, before moving to the court of the Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg for about the years 1506–8. In Germany he was often known as ""Jacop Walch"", probably from ""Wälsch"" meaning foreigner, a term especially used for Italians. He may have returned to Venice with Philip the Handsome of Burgundy, for whom he  later worked in the Netherlands. By March 1510 he was working for Philip's successor Archduchess Margaret in Brussels and Mechelen. In January 1511 he fell ill and made a will, and in March the Archduchess gave him a pension for life, on account of his age and weakness (""debilitation et vieillesse""). By 1516 he had died, leaving the Archduchess in possession of twenty-three engraving plates, which since many of his plates were probably engraved on both sides, means some engravings may not have survived.        His earliest documented work is his huge (1.345 x 2.818 metres, from six blocks) and impressive woodcut aerial view Map of Venice, for which a privilege was granted to its publisher in 1500, recording that the work had taken three years. This clearly drew on the work of many surveyors, but was a spectacular feat nonetheless, and caused a considerable stir from the first. It was later updated by others to reflect major new building projects in a second state of the print. Apart from the Map of Venice, he produced two other woodcuts, both of men and satyrs, which were the largest and most impressive figurative woodcuts yet produced, and which established the Italian tradition of fine, large, woodcuts for the following decades. These may have also been produced before 1500; they are clearly strongly influenced by Mantegna.     By the time the Map of Venice was published de' Barbari had already left for Germany, where he met Dürer, who he may have already known from Dürer's first Italian trip (a passage in a letter of Dürer's is ambiguous). They discussed human proportion, not obviously one of de' Barbari's strengths, but Dürer was evidently fascinated by what he had to say, though he recorded that de' Barberi had not told him everything he knew:  ...I find no one who has written anything about how to make canon of human proportions except for a man named Jacob, born in Venice and a charming painter. He showed me a man and a woman which he had made according to measure, so that I would now rather see what he meant than behold a new kingdom... Jacobus did not want to show his principles to me clearly, that I saw well. (From an unpublished draft of the Introduction to Dürer's own book on human proportions) Twenty years later Dürer tried unsuccessfully to get the Archduchess Margaret, Habsburg Regent of the Netherlands, to give him a manuscript book she had on the subject by de' Barbari, by then dead; the book has not survived.    De' Barberi spent a year in Nuremberg, where Dürer lived, in 1500–1, and influences flowed in both directions between him and Dürer for a number of years. None of his engravings are dated, so much of the dating of them depends on resemblances to dated prints by Dürer; this is complicated by uncertainty in some cases as to who was influencing whom. Five of his engravings were in an album of Hartmann Schedel's, which was bound up in December 1504, which gives further evidence as to dating. De' Barberi had probably made some engravings before leaving Italy, but his best engravings (and perhaps all of them) were probably done after his move to Germany in 1500. Some of his paintings are dated as: 1500, 1503, 1504, 1508. Documents relating to his employment by Maximilian suggest his work was to include illuminating manuscripts, but no work in this medium has been generally attributed to him. His only generally accepted drawing is a Cleopatra in the British Museum, apparently done as a study for an engraving which has not survived.     His style is related to his possible master, Alvise Vivarini and to Giovanni Bellini, but has a languorous quality all its own. Apart from Dürer, the influence of Mantegna's technique also appears in what are probably the earlier engravings, done around the turn of the century, with parallel hatching. His engravings are mostly small, showing just a few figures. Truculent satyrs feature in several prints; there are a number of mythological subjects, including two Sacrifices to Priapus. The earlier prints show figures with ""small heads and somewhat shapeless bodies, with sloping shoulders and thick torsos supported by slender legs"" — also seen in his paintings. Probably from a middle period come several nudes, the most famous being Apollo and Diana, St Sebastian and the Three Bound Captives.  In these his ability to organise the whole composition has greatly improved. In a final group, the style becomes more Italianate, and the compositions more complex. These have an enigmatic, haunting atmosphere, and a very refined technique. Levenson has proposed that they date from his period in the Netherlands and were influenced by the young Lucas van Leyden.     His paintings are mostly portraits or half-length groups of religious figures. He painted a live Sparrowhawk(National Gallery, London), which is probably a fragment of a larger work. The very early still-life of a Still-Life with Partridge and Gauntlets (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) is often called the first small scale trompe l'oeil painting since antiquity; it may well have been the cover or reverse of a portrait (however, a fragmentary panel by another Venetian, Vittorio Carpaccio, has a trompe l'oeil letter-rack of about 1490 on the reverse). In the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin there is a Portrait of a German Man and a religious subject. The Louvre has a religious group, and Philadelphia a pair of figures. A disputed but famous work, the Portrait of Fra Luca Pacioli is in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples. This shows the Franciscan mathematician and expert on perspective demonstrating geometry at a table on which lie his own Summa and a work by Euclid. He is accompanied by a not clearly identified student. The work is signed ""IACO. BAR VIGEN/NIS 1495"". Jacopo de' Barbari is attributed a Christ Blessing displayed at the Snite Museum of Art in Notre Dame University, Indiana.    Old master print   "
"Ludovico Barbo, O.S.B. (1381–1443), also referred to as Luigi Barbo, was a significant figure in the movement to reform monastic life in northern Italy during the 15th century. [SEP] Originally a canon of the community which became the Canons Regular of San Giorgio in Alga, he died a Benedictine abbot and Bishop of Treviso (1437–1443).    A young nobleman (born into the Barbo family) of the Republic of Venice, in 1397 Barbo received as a benefice the position of commendatory prior of a monastery of Augustinian friars on the isolated island of San Giorgio in Alga. During that period he was influenced by the preaching of an itinerant canon regular, Bernardo of Rome, who was promoting the new form of spirituality known as the Devotio Moderna, which had developed in the Low Countries. Through his brother, Francesco, he was made aware of two cousins, Antonio Correr and Gabriele Condulmer (later to become Pope Eugene IV), also disciples of Bartolomeo, who were following a way of life patterned on that of the Brothers of the Common Life. Inspired by their manner of life, in 1404 he gave the nearly derelict monastery to them, and soon both he and his brother joined the community, which also counted the later saint, Lawrence Giustiniani.On 30 November of that year, the new monastery had grown to 17 members, all members of the clergy, and received the formal approval of Pope Boniface IX. Though primarily following the life of an enclosed religious order, the canons of the monastery successfully observed the life of the cloister without professing religious vows and also served in a limited form of Christian ministry to the people of the Republic. The success of the community led to the adoption of its format by communities of canons around the region, leading to the formation of a new congregation of canons, presided over by San Giorgio.Along with Giustiniani, who had become the head of the Priory of St. Augustine in Vicenza, Barbo was tasked to reform the clergy and monastic institutions in Italy. Both men saw methodical prayer and Christian meditation as essential tools for reform. As part of this program, in 1408 Pope Gregory XII appointed him the abbot of the Benedictine Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua, where he became a Benedictine monk, and with the help of three canons from San Giorgio di Alga worked to reform the life of the monastic community. Despite his relatively young age of 27, Barbo was successful in his efforts, and the abbey flourished to such a degree that it too became the center of a congregation of monasteries following its form of life.One of Barbo's reforms was to allow his monks to sleep in separate cells, a reform that is regarded as an important step towards enhancing spirituality by providing them with more solitude. Many of the reforms which Barbo instituted were quickly adopted in other monasteries. At the time of his death he had reformed 16 monasteries, including the one at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome.

"Marco Barbo (1420 – 2 March 1491) of Venice was a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church (1467) and patriarch of Aquileia (1470)    He was a member of the noble Barbo family and a third cousin of Pietro Barbo, who became Pope Paul II. [SEP] In Rome he resided in the Palazzo di San Marco, as did the Venetian pope, who elected not to remove to the Vatican. From 1467 he was the cardinal patron of the Knights of Rhodes, for whom he built the loggia on the imperial forums.  At Paul's death, he was absent from Rome for several years; on his return he commissioned Paul's tomb from Mino da Fiesole, who completed it in 1477 for Old St. Peter's Basilica; fragments are conserved in the Vatican Museums. Barbo participated in the Papal conclave, 1471, which elected Pope Sixtus IV, for whom he served as legate to Germany, Hungary and Poland, with the charge, in which he was unsuccessful, of promoting a crusade against the Turks. He left Rome 22 February 1472 and went to the court of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, whom he was unable to inspire to combat the Ottoman Turks. Barbo returned to Rome 26 October 1474. Possessed of several abbacies in commendam, he was elected Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals and bishop of Palestrina (1478), where he restored the cathedral. His diplomacy defused the partisan tensions that were building in Rome before the conclave of 1484. For a price, he secured the Castel Sant'Angelo from Girolamo Riario and convinced both Orsini and Colonna factions to evacuate the city, leaving the conclave in security and peace. During the consistory, Barbo was one of those considered papabile; the election of Pope Innocent VIII was a compromise effected between cardinals Della Rovere and Rodrigo Borgia (later Pope Alexander VI) to block the candidacy of the Cardinal of St. Mark. Barbo was the eldest son of Marino Barbo and Filippa della Riva. He was an erudite patron of the humanists so distrusted by Paul II, but as chancellor of the Sapienza, he was constrained to withhold the salary of Pomponio Leto, who had fled to Venice. Marco Barbo assembled an outstanding library; generous and charitable, he distributed all his wealth to the poor of Rome at his death.   "
"Angelo Barovier (Venice, year unknown – Venice, 1460) was an Italian glass artist. [SEP] Raised in a family with a long tradition of glass working, Barovier was certainly the best-known member and significant for uniting the knowledge passed down for generations as an artist and a scientist.The biographical details are few and fragmentary, but relate his ability in the treatment of glass. The humanist Ludovico Carbone, for example, described Angelum Venetum as optimum artificem crystallinorum vasorum (largest producer of crystalline vessels). Another testimony to the high esteem for Barovier is the decree of Venetian Republic in around 1455 that granted him the exclusive rights to production of clean glass, produced by a technique he developed, which he called crystal glass or Venetian crystal. According to some, Barovier should be recognized for originally developing a glass paste called Chalcedony. At the request of Filaret, architect of the Dukes of Milan, Barovier was summoned in 1455 at the court of Milan in order to suggest the best glass paste to be used in the construction of Sforzinda, the ideal city desired by Francesco Sforza and designed (but never implemented) by the same Filaret. There are no known true works of Barovier, although some historians assign him a  wedding Cup  in the museum of the glass Murano, the cup of birds to Trent and a blue glass in the City Museum Medieval of Bologna.     The name Barovier comes from the word berroviere, which indicates the armiger guarding the captain of the people. It is likely that a Barovier, originally from Treviso, settled in Murano around the 1291, when a law of Republic required all glassworkers to live on the island. The oldest representative of the family of which we know is Jacobello (born around 1295), whose sons Anthony and Bartholomew are mentioned in documents of 1348 as fiolari (glassmakers). A son of Bartholomew, James, remembered as a master glassmaker and a furnace owner, was the father of Barovier.    Barovier & Toso   "
"Giacomo Barri (died 1690) was an Italian painter and printmaker of the Baroque period. [SEP] He was born in Venice. He etched some plates from his own designs, and in 1671 published a book entitled Viaggio pittoresco d'Italia, with summary vedute of the towns and paintings of great masters from diverse cities of Italy. Within a decade, the book was re-published in English by William Lodge (1649–1689) from Leeds. He also completed an etching of the Nativity after Paolo Veronese.   "
"Vittore Belliniano was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period considered to be identical with Bellini Bellini and Vittore di Matteo. [SEP] He was a native of Venice, active c. year 1525.

"Bernardo Bembo (19 October 1433 – 28 May 1519) was a Venetian humanist, dipomat and statesman. [SEP] He was the father of Pietro Bembo.    Bembo was the son of Nicolò Bembo and Elisabetta di Andrea Paruta. He studied philosophy at the University of Padua, earning a bachelor of arts degree under the guidance of Gaetano da Thiene on 10 November 1455. He continued to study law thereafter, finally earning his doctor of both laws degree on 19 January 1465. He continued to live in Padua until 1468. During his Paduan period, he visited Rome as part of a congratulatory embassy to Pope Calixtus III (1455), delivered congratulations to Doge Cristoforo Moro on behalf of the law students (1462) and delivered the eulogy at the funeral for Bertoldo d'Este (8 March 1464). He married his first wife, Elena di Matteo of the Morosini family, in 1462. Widowed, he married a second time to Elena Marcello, the mother of Pietro.    Bembo was the Venetian ambassador to the court of Henry IV of Castile in 1468–1469. On 16 July 1471, he was commissioned as ambassador to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. On 18 June 1472, he signed the Treaty of Péronne, creating a five-year alliance between Venice and Burgundy. After a three-year stay at the Burgundian court, he was appointed ambassador to Sigismund, Archduke of Austria, on 23 August 1474. This mission, if it was in fact undertaken, was not fruitful and he returned to Venice before the end of the year. There he was one of the 41 ducal electors chosen to select the doge. Pietro Mocenigo was elected.Bembo was appointed ambassador to Florence on 23 December 1474. In this capacity, he promised Lorenzo de' Medici to do his best to procure the return of the bones of Dante Alighieri to Florence. He returned to Venice in 1476, but was reappointed in July 1478 following the Pazzi conspiracy, presumably because of his friendship with Lorenzo. His second ambassadorship in Florence ended in 1480.Between 1481 and 1483, Bembo was the podestà and capitano del popolo of Ravenna. In this capacity he renovated the tomb of Dante, commissioning Pietro Lombardo to carve a portrait for it. For this he was praised in an epigram of Cristoforo Landino. The latter part of his term in Ravenna was taken up by the War of Ferrara, which began in May 1482. On 9 July 1483, Bembo was appointed ambassador to England. On 13 February 1484, he was made ambassador to France. No details about either mission survive, although Domenico Malipiero in his Annali says that Bembo went to England. He had returned to Venice by early 1485, when he was elected one of four ambassadors to pay homage to Pope Innocent VIII. He served a first term as avogadore di comun (public prosecutor) in 1486, a role he reprised another five times (1494–1495, 1500, 1504–1505, 1509–1510, 1512–1513).Bembo was tried for fiscal improprieties and acquitted by the Council of Ten on 22 October 1487. He returned to Rome in November 1487 as the Venetian representative at the papal arbitration of the Republic's dispute with Sigismund of Austria, which had led to the brief War of Rovereto in the Tyrol. He was still in Rome in October 1488, when he was elected podestà of Bergamo. He served for two years (1489–1490), during which he revised the municipal statutes. In October 1492, he was chosen by the Senate to be a member of the zonta (an extraordinary commission of the senate), a position in which he served uninterrupted for many years. On 1 October 1496, he joined the Council of Ten. He conveyed to the council the offer of Tristano Savorgnan to poison Charles VIII of France, then invading Italy. The Council rejected the proposal. His term was cut short by his appointment as visdomino of Ferrara in July or August 1497.As visdomino, Bembo reported on the anti-Venetian hostility of Ercole d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, yet he also forwarded to Venice Ercole's offer to mediate the end of the Pisan War, in which Venice had taken the side of Pisa against Florence. Ercole issued his award, detrimental to Venice, on 26 April 1499. Bembo reported to the College in Venice on 21 July 1499. On 15 November, he was elected to the Dieci Savi. In 1500, he rejoined the Council of Ten and was its head in March and May. Between August and December 1500, he was a governatore delle entrate.On 30 September 1501, Bembo was a ducal elector in the election that chose Leonardo Loredan. From 10 April 1502 until mid-1503 he was podestà of Verona, in conjunction with which he was also to act as ambassador to King Louis XII of France, who was invading Italy. For this reason he was away from Verona between 15 June and 28 August 1502, first at Pavia and from 27 July at Milan. He describes the triumphal entry of Louis XII in Milan in a letter to Marino Sanuto the Younger. In Verona, he entertained Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, and his wife, Isabella d'Este.    On 11 November 1503, Bembo was selected for the embassy of congratulation to Pope Julius II on his election, but for political reasons related to the downfall of Cesare Borgia it did not set out until March 1505. In the interim he served as avogadore di comun. He wrote an account of this embassy valuable for its description of Rome's antiquities. This was his last embassy and he spent the rest of his life in Venice except for some short visits to Padua. He was never very wealthy, but he did own land in the Terraferma near Padua.From October 1505 until August 1506, Bembo sat on the Council of Ten. He left to take up the post of provveditore of fodder, and the Council elected him to its zonta (extraordinary commission) on 8 August. His term as avogadore in 1510–1511 following the battle of Agnadello was eventful. With Marino Giustinian and Alvise Gradenigo, he proposed the review of Antonio Grimani's exile that brought back the military to Venice at a time of need. He also sat on the commission that tried the Paduans for rebellion, and launched the trial of Angelo Trevisan before the Great Council on 20 February 1510.In August 1510, Bembo rejoined the Council of Ten. He fought hard for but lost election as podestà of Padua in November. Marino Sanuto considered scandalous to find such ""ambition ... in the aged"". It is likely that financial need more than ambition motivated Bembo. He often appears as an insolvent debtor of the state in these years. On 1 December, he joined the Ducal Council. On 11 July 1511, he was elected again to the Council of Ten. This time he was unable to fully take part in its proceedings and was so ill for a time that Pietro came to visit him. From 10 May 1512 until 23 May 1513 he was avogadore. He was elected to the Council of Ten for a last time on 9 October and served one year. His last term was active and he was frequently head of the council. In late 1514 he withdrew from public life.Tee failure in December 1514 of his son's mission on behalf of Pope Leo X to Venice seems to have dispirited Bembo. He rejected re-election to the zonta of the Senate. He fell ill on 19 May 1519. Pietro learned of his father's illness at Bologna, but did not arrive in Venice before his death on 28 May. He was buried in the church of San Salvador on 30 May.    Bembo corresponded with Lorenzo de' Medici, Cristoforo Landino, Dante III Alighieri, Ermolao Barbaro, Pietro Barozzi, Baldassarre Castiglione, Marsilio Ficino, Francesco Filelfo, Lauro Quirini, Marcantonio Sabellico, Antonio Vinciguerra and Jacopo Zeno. He wrote mostly speeches and letters in Latin. Sanuto praises him as ""most learned, great in humanitas"" and says that he continued to write until his last hour, always ""well-composed and full of all erudition"". Among his surviving writings are:  Gratulatio ad Christophorum Maurum pro clarissimo divini atque humani iuris scolasticorum ordine Patavini habita (1462), his congratulation to Cristoforo Moro Oratio in adventu cardinalis Sancti Angeli legati apostolici (1460) Oratio in adventu Jacobi Zeni episcopi Patavini (1460) Oratio in funere Bertholdi marchionis Estensis, his eulogy for Bertoldo d'Este, with a consolatio to his widow Jacoba  (1464) Orationes ad Innocentium VIII (1487–1488), three orations delivered before Innocent VIII during his second embassy to him a zibaldoneBembo amassed a large library. He has been seen, along with Girolamo Donato and Ermolao Barbaro, as representative of late 15th-century Venetian humanism. More than any other Venetian humanist he was familiar with the thinking current at Florence.   "
"Giambattista (Gianbattista) Benedetti (August 14, 1530 in Venice – January 20, 1590 in Turin) was an Italian mathematician from Venice who was also interested in physics, mechanics, the construction of sundials, and the science of music.    In his works Resolutio omnium Euclidis problematum (1553) and Demonstratio proportionum motuum localium (1554), Benedetti proposed a new doctrine of the speed of bodies in free fall. The accepted Aristotelian doctrine at that time was that the speed of a freely falling body is directly proportional to the total weight of the body and inversely proportional to the density of the medium. Benedetti's view was that the speed depends on just the difference between the specific gravity of the body and that of the medium. As opposed to the Aristotelian theory, his theory predicts that two objects of the same material but of different weights would fall at the same speed, and also that objects of different materials in a vacuum would fall at different though finite speeds.In a second edition of the Demonstratio (also 1554), he extended this theory to include the effect of the resistance of the medium, which he said was proportional to the cross section or the surface area of the body. Thus two objects of the same material but of different surface areas would only fall at equal speeds in a vacuum. He repeated this version of his theory in his later Diversarum speculationum mathematicarum et physicarum liber (1585). In this work he explains his theory in terms of the then current theory of impetus.It is thought that Galileo derived his initial theory of the speed of a freely falling body from his reading of Benedetti's works. Thus the account found in Galileo's De motu, his early work on the science of motion, follows Benedetti's initial theory as described above. It omits the later development which included the resistance of the medium and not just its density. In this early work, Galileo also subscribes to the theory of impetus.In 1572, the Jesuit Jean Taisner published from the press of Johann Birkmann of Cologne a work entitled Opusculum perpetua memoria dignissimum, de natura magnetis et ejus effectibus, Item de motu continuo.  This is considered a piece of plagiarism, as Taisnier presents, as though his own, the Epistola de magnete of Peter of Maricourt and the second edition of Benedetti's Demonstratio.    In a letter to Cipriano de Rore dated from around 1563, Benedetti proposed a new theory of the cause of consonance, arguing that since sound consists of air waves or vibrations, in the more consonant intervals the shorter, more frequent waves concurred with the longer, less frequent waves at regular intervals.  Isaac Beeckman and Marin Mersenne both adopted this theory in the next century.  In the same letter, he proposed a measure of consonance by taking the product of the numerator and the denominator of a rational interval in lowest terms. James Tenney also used this method to develop his measure of ""harmonic distance"" (log2(ab) is the harmonic distance for the ratio b/a measured from an arbitrary tonal center 1/1). When they sought Descartes' opinion on Benedetti's theory, Descartes declined to judge the goodness of consonances by such a rational method. [SEP]  Descartes argued that the ear prefers one or another according to the musical context rather than because of any concordance of vibrations.   "
"Immanuel Benveniste (also Manuel Benveniste) (1608 in Venice – c. 1660 in Amsterdam) was an Italian Jewish printer in Amsterdam who printed many Hebrew works including an edition of the Talmud from 1644-48. [SEP] He was one of a number of notable Portuguese Jewish printers at Amsterdam in the seventeenth century, including Manasseh ben Israel, David de Castro Tartas, and Joseph and Immanuel Athias. Benveniste also published the sermons of Saul Levi Morteira in 1652.Benveniste’s printer’s device (which may have been the family escutcheon) showed an upright lion facing a tower with a star above. Apparently, later printers often “borrowed” this mark for various reasons. The first to do so were Ben Judah ben Mordecai of Posen and Samuel ben Moses ha-Levi, Ashkenazic printers who had previously worked for Benveniste. In their case, Benveniste presumably allowed them to use the mark, perhaps as a show of support for his former employees.   "

Eighteen of his works survive.  According to his vida, while travelling with a large band of merchants to Byzantium, they were captured by the Republic of Genoa, which was then at war with that of Venice, and taken prisoner to Genoa. There Zorzi composed many songs from prison and even collaborated on some tensos with Bonifaci Calvo, a native Genoese troubadour. In response to a sirventes in which Bonifaci blamed the Genoese for allowing the Venetians to gain the upper hand and insult them, Zorzi composed the sirventes Molt me sui fort d'un chant merveillatz (""I was very much surprised by a song"") justifying Venice. The response convinced Bonifaci and the two became friends.Upon the release of the prisoners when Venice and Genoa came to terms of peace (about seven years later), Bertolome returned to Venice and was rewarded by the Doge with the castellanies of Coron and Modon in southwestern Morea. According to his vida, there he fell in love with a beautiful local noblewoman and spent the rest of his life.Zorzi wrote a sestina entitled En tal dezir mos cors intra that alludes to the Perceval of Arthurian legend confessing to his uncle.

"Faustina Bordoni (30 March 1697 – 4 November 1781) was an Italian mezzo-soprano. [SEP] In Hamburg, Germany, the Johann Adolph Hasse Museum is dedicated to her husband and partly to Bordoni.    She was born in Venice and brought up under the protection of the aristocratic brother composers Alessandro and Benedetto Marcello. Her singing teacher was another composer, Michelangelo Gasparini. For many years in the service of the Elector Palatine, she made her operatic debut at Venice in 1716 in Carlo Francesco Pollarolo's Ariodante, singing in her home city until 1725 in operas by Albinoni, the Gasparini brothers, Giacomelli, Leonardo Leo, Giuseppe Maria Orlandini, the Pollarolos, father and son, and Leonardo Vinci, amongst others. In 1718 and 1719 in Venice she sang alongside Francesca Cuzzoni, later to become her great rival. During this period she also performed several times at Reggio nell'Emilia, Naples and Parma, and at least once in Milan, Modena and Florence. After her German début in 1723, singing in  Pietro Torri's Griselda at Munich, she was a great favourite north of the Alps during the 1720s, also enjoying great success in Vienna (1725–26). Her nickname was the ""new siren"", and she was commonly known simply as ""Faustina"".     Her London début, as Rossane in Handel's Alessandro, took place on 5 May 1726, alongside Senesino and Cuzzoni. During the next two seasons she created four more Handel roles: Alceste in Admeto and Pulcheria in Riccardo Primo (both 1727), and Emira in Siroe and Elisa in Tolomeo (1728). She also sang in a revival of Radamisto, and in operas by Ariosti and Giovanni Bononcini. In a performance of the latter's Astianatte on 6 June 1727, a riot broke out in the audience between her followers and those of her 'rival' Cuzzoni in the King's Theatre, Haymarket,  in front of Caroline, Princess of Wales. This furore seized the public imagination and a great deal of journalistic exaggeration  – the pamphleteer John Arbuthnot published ""The DEVIL to pay at St. JAMES's: Or A full and true ACCOUNT of a most horrid and bloody BATTLE between Madam FAUSTINA and Madam CUZZONI"", in which he lambasted the two ladies: ""TWO of a Trade seldom or ever agree … But who would have thought the Infection should reach the Hay-market and inspire Two Singing Ladies to pull each other's Coiffs, to the no small Disquiet of the Directors, who (God help them) have enough to do to keep Peace and Quietness between them. … I shall not determine who is the Aggressor, but take the surer Side, and wisely pronounce them both in Fault; for it is certainly an apparent Shame that two such well bred Ladies should call Bitch and Whore, should scold and fight like any Billingsgates."" Recent research has shown, however, that it was the singers' supporters who were behaving badly, rather than the singers themselves, who had worked together before in Italy and continued to work together for the Royal Academy until the directors were forced to dissolve it in 1728 owing to mounting debts.     Unlike Cuzzoni, Faustina never returned to England. During the years 1728–1732, she was again much in evidence on the stages of major Italian cities, especially Venice. In 1730, she married the German composer, Johann Adolf Hasse, and the following year the couple were summoned to the court of Augustus the Strong at Dresden, where Faustina enjoyed a great success in her husband's opera Cleofide. They were described by the famous librettist Metastasio as ""truly an exquisite couple"". Hasse remained at the Saxon court for more than thirty years, and his wife sang in at least fifteen of the operas he composed between Caio Fabricio in 1734 and Ciro riconosciuto (1751). Faustina was, however, permitted to make many long trips to Italy, appearing again in Naples, Venice, Parma and elsewhere in operas by Pergolesi, Porpora and Vinci, alongside those of her husband. Though she retired from the theatre in 1751, Faustina kept her salary and title of virtuosa da camera to the Elector until the death of Augustus' successor, Frederick Augustus II in 1763. At this point, she and her husband moved to Vienna, before removing finally to Venice in 1773. They had two daughters, both trained singers. On a visit in 1772, Charles Burney described Faustina as ""a short, brown, sensible, and lively old woman ... with good remains … of that beauty for which she was so much celebrated in her youth."" Unlike her rival Cuzzoni, who died in poverty, Faustina had a happy and prosperous old age.    The composer Quantz gave a description of Bordoni's qualities, as given to Charles Burney:  Faustina had a mezzo-soprano voice, that was less clear than penetrating. Her compass now was only from B flat to G in alt; but after this time she extended its limits downward. She possessed what the Italians call un cantar granito; her execution was articulate and brilliant. She had a fluent tongue for pronouncing words rapidly and distinctly, and a flexible throat for divisions, with so beautiful a shake that she put it in motion upon short notice, just when she would. The passages might be smooth, or by leaps, or consisting of iterations of the same note; their execution was equally easy to her as to any instrument whatever. She was, doubtless, the first who introduced with success a swift repetition of the same note. She sang adagios with great passion and expression, but was not equally successful if such deep sorrow were to be impressed on the hearer as might require dragging, sliding, or notes of syncopation and tempo rubato. She had a very happy memory in arbitrary changes and embellishments, and a clear and quick judgment in giving to words their full value and expression. In her action she was very happy; and as her performance possessed that flexibility of muscles and face-play which constitute expression, she succeeded equally well in furious, tender, and amorous parts. In short, she was born for singing and acting. Burney himself remarked on the strength of the note E (E5) in her voice, and it is worth noting that half of the arias written for her by Handel are in E or A (minor or major), keys which could give this note particular prominence.

"Marco Antonio Bragadin, also Marcantonio Bragadin (21 April 1523 – 17 August 1571), was a Venetian lawyer and military officer of the Republic of Venice. [SEP] Bragadin joined the Fanti da Mar Corps or marines of the Republic of Venice. In 1569, he was appointed Captain-General of Famagusta in Cyprus and led the Venetian resistance to the Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573). He was gruesomely killed in August 1571 after the Ottoman Empire took Famagusta, the fall of which signalled the end of Western presence in the Mediterranean island for the next three centuries.    He was born in Venice. After a short stint as lawyer in 1543, Bragadin pursued a career in the navy, being entrusted with several posts on the Venetian galleys. Once back in Venice Bragadin was pressed into the city's magistrates; in 1560 and later in 1566 he was made a galley governor, without, though, having occasion to actually assume command of a ship.    In 1569 he was elected as Captain of the Kingdom of Cyprus and moved to Famagusta, then a rich port, where he assumed civil governorship over the whole island, well aware that a decisive clash with the Ottoman fleet was imminent. Bragadin worked hard to fortify Famagusta thoroughly; the introduction of gunpowder meant that scientifically-planned fortifications with solid walls were needed. So the harbour was endowed with strong defenses, such as the Martinengo bastion, an excellent example of modern fortification granting easy defense on both sides of its walls. The Turks landed at Cyprus on July 3, 1570. Nicosia fell in two months' time and its garrison was slaughtered. The severed head of the locumtenens regni (""viceroy""), Niccolò Dandolo, was sent to Bragadin, who, undaunted, prepared for the enemy assault.    Famagusta came under siege on September 17, 1570.Marcantonio Bragadin led the defence of Famagusta with Lorenzo Tiepolo, Captain of Paphos, and general Astorre Baglioni. The Ottoman forces kept pressure on for months, while their artillery relentlessly pounded the city's bulwarks. According to Venetian chroniclers (whose numbers are treated with some skepticism by modern scholarship), about 6,000 garrison troops stood against some 100,000 Turks with 1,500 cannons, backed by about 150 ships enforcing a naval blockade to stave off reinforcements and resupply efforts. The besieged garrison of Famagusta put up a heroic struggle lasting well beyond the most optimistic assumptions, against far superior enemy numbers and without any hope of help from the motherland. Furthermore, the Turks were employing new tactics. The entire belt of walls surrounding the town and the exterior plain was filled with earth up to the top of the fortifications. In the meantime a number of tunnels were dug out towards and under the city walls to undermine and breach them. In July, 1571 the Turks eventually breached the fortifications and their forces broke into the citadel, being repulsed only at the cost of heavy losses. With provisions and ammunition running out, and no sign of relief from Venice on August 1, Bragadin asked for terms of surrender.     Famagusta's defenders made terms with the Ottomans before the city was taken by force, since the traditional laws of war allowed for negotiation before the city's defenses were successfully breached, whereas after a city fell by storm all lives and property in the city would be forfeit. The Ottoman commander agreed that, in return for the city's surrender, all Westerners in the city could exit under their own flag and be guaranteed safe passage to Venice-held Crete; Greeks could leave immediately, or wait two years to decide whether to remain in Famagusta under Ottoman rule, or depart the city for any destination of their choice. For the next four days, evacuation proceeded smoothly. Then, at the surrender ceremony on August 5 where Bragadin offered the vacated city to Mustafa, the Ottoman general accused him of murdering Turkish prisoners and hiding munitions. Suddenly, Mustafa pulled a knife and cut off Bragadin's right ear, then ordered his guards to cut off the other ear and his nose. There followed a massacre of all Christians still in the city, with Bragadin himself most brutally abused. After being left in prison for two weeks, his earlier wounds festering, he was dragged round the walls with ""sacks of earth and stone"" on his back; next, he was tied to a chair and hoisted to the yardarm of the Turkish flagship, where he was exposed to the taunts of the sailors. Finally, he was taken to his place of execution in the main square, tied naked to a column, and flayed alive. Bragadin's quartered body was then distributed as a war trophy among the army, and his skin was stuffed with straw and sewn, reinvested with his military insignia, and exhibited riding an ox in a mocking procession along the streets of Famagusta. The macabre trophy, together with the severed heads of general Alvise Martinengo, Gianantonio Querini and castellan Andrea Bragadin, was hoisted upon the masthead pennant of the personal galley of the Ottoman commander, Amir al-bahr Mustafa Pasha, to be brought to Constantinople as a gift for Sultan Selim II.Bragadin's skin was later stolen from Constantinople's arsenal in 1580 by the young Venetian seaman Girolamo Polidori, who was there on business. He brought it back to Venice, where it was received as a returning hero. The skin was preserved first in the church of San Gregorio, then interred with full honors in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, where it still is.Bragadin's fame rests upon the incredible resistance that he made against the vastly superior besieging forces. From a military point of view, the besieged garrison's perseverance required a massive effort by the Ottoman Turks, who were so heavily committed that they were unable to redeploy in time when the Holy League built up the fleet later victorious against the Muslim power at Lepanto. Historians to this day debate just why Venice did not send help to Bragadin from Souda, Crete. It is alleged that some Venetians thought about putting their limited military assets to better use in the forthcoming clash, already in sight, which would climax in the Battle of Lepanto. When news of Bragadin's agonizing death reached Venice, he was regarded as a martyr and his story galvanized Venetian soldiers in the fleet of the Holy League. The Venetian seamen went on to fight with greater zeal than any of the other combatants at the decisive Battle of Lepanto where an Ottoman fleet was crushed by the combined force of much of Western Europe.An impostor using the name Marco Bragadino claimed to be Bragadin's son.  In Venice and later Germany the impostor claimed amongst other things to be able to convert base metals into gold until he was executed in 1591.   "

"Giovanni Francesco Busenello (24 September 1598 – 27 October 1659) was an Italian lawyer, librettist and poet of the 17th century. [SEP] Born to a low-class family of Venice, it is thought that he studied at the University of Oberhausen in der Pfalz, where according to himself he was taught by Paolo Sarpi and Cesare Cremonino. He began to practice law in 1623, and is thought to have been highly successful in his chosen profession. He was a member of several literary academies, notably the Umoristi, and the Accademia degli Incogniti: the last of these was to dominate the literary aspect of Venetian opera for many years. Busenello's verse output was prolific, and included several poems addressed to singers.  He died at Legnaro, near Padua. In musical history, he is best remembered for his five libretti, each written for the Venetian opera, and set by Claudio Monteverdi and Francesco Cavalli. His libretto for Gli amori d'Apollo e di Dafne (Francesco Cavalli, 1640) is heavily based on Giovanni Battista Guarini's Il pastor fido, while L'incoronazione di Poppea (1642), set by Monteverdi, is noted among early libretti for the strength and vividness with which the individual characters are sketched. His other works, all set by Cavalli,  are La Didone (1641), La prosperità infelice di Giulio Cesare dittatore (1646, but music lost or possibly never composed) and La Statira (1655).  Patrick J. Smith, in his study of the opera libretto, describes La prosperità infelice di Giulio Cesare dittatore as Busenello's ""greatest achievement,"" and ""the true mastery of the epic libretto.""He also wrote a sixth libretto that he did not publish in his 1656 collected works, La Discesa di Enea all'Inferno (1640), identified by Arthur Livingston, the leading scholar on Busenello.

"Francesco Caffi (14 June 1778 in Venice – 24 January 1874 in Padua) was a councillor and musicologist. [SEP]    Caffi was born the son of Michele and Bianca Boncio on 14 June 1778. Caffi initially studied law (the profession of his family) privately with don Benedetto de Luca. Afterward, Caffi decided to dedicate himself to music, studying counterpoint under Matteo Rauzzini, Simon Mayr, and Giuseppe Scatena, who was an Augustinian friar and pupil of Antonio Lotti. He studied harpsichord under Francesco Gardi. While still young, he began composing cantatas, melodrammi, and a few instrumental pieces. Though the young Venetian never made it his profession to compose, it allowed him to expand his musicological studies and integrate himself in the music culture of his hometown.In 1811, Caffi and other music enthusiasts formed the Philharmonic Institute of Venice. The public school of music included concert halls, headquartering in the Saint Rocco and Margherita monastery. The institution closed in 1816 because of economic issues, however. Still, the enterprise proved to be viable.While a magistrate, Caffi continued to study music history, beginning to draft his Storia generale della musica presso i Veneziani (General History of the Music of the Venetians). The history was initially meant to be divided into five sections. The first three sections would discuss the three musical genres: ecclesiastical, theatrical, and academic. The fourth and fifth sections discussed popular and Venetian music, respectively. His work on the history ceased in 1827, however, when he was transferred to the Milan Court of Appeals. Here, he was able to research and prepare biographies of some musicians from the Venetian school: Andrea Gabrieli, Baldassare Galuppi, Antonio Lotti, Benedetto Marcello, and Gioseffo Zarlino, among others. He first printed these in his Storia della musica sacra (History of Sacred Music).   "
"Antonio Caldara (1670 – 28 December 1736) was an Italian Baroque composer. [SEP] Caldara was born in Venice (exact date unknown), the son of a violinist. He became a chorister at St Mark's in Venice, where he learned several instruments, probably under the instruction of Giovanni Legrenzi. In 1699 he relocated to Mantua, where he became maestro di cappella to the inept Charles IV, Duke of Mantua, a pensionary of France with a French wife, who took the French side in the War of the Spanish Succession. Caldara removed from Mantua in 1707, after the French were expelled from Italy, then moved on to Barcelona as chamber composer to Charles III, the pretender to the Spanish throne (following the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 without any direct heir) and who kept a royal court at Barcelona. There, he wrote some operas that are the first Italian operas performed in Spain. He moved on to Rome, becoming maestro di cappella to Francesco Maria Marescotti Ruspoli, 1st Prince of Cerveteri. While there he wrote in 1710 La costanza in amor vince l'inganno (Faithfulness in Love Defeats Treachery) for the public theatre at Macerata. With the unexpected death of Emperor Joseph I from smallpox at the age of 32 in April 1711, Caldara deemed it prudent to renew his connections with Charles III – soon to become Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI – as he travelled from Spain to Vienna via northern Italy. Caldara visited Vienna in 1712, but found Marc'Antonio Ziani and Johann Joseph Fux firmly ensconced in the two highest musical posts. He stopped at the Salzburg court on his return journey to Rome, where he was well received (and to which he subsequently sent one new opera annually from 1716 to 1727). In 1716, following the death the previous year of Ziani and the promotion of Fux to Hofkapellmeister, Caldara was appointed Vize-Kapellmeister to the Imperial Court in Vienna, and there he remained until his death. Caldara is best known as a composer of operas, cantatas and oratorios. Several of his works have libretti by Pietro Metastasio, the court poet at Vienna from 1729.   "
"Domenico Campagnola (c. 1500–1564) was an Italian painter and printmaker in engraving and woodcut of the Venetian Renaissance, but whose most influential works were his drawings of landscapes. [SEP]    Born probably in Venice, he was the  pupil of his father, the leading engraver and painter Giulio Campagnola. He appears to have been adopted by his father as a young boy. His grandfather, Girolamo Campagnola was a famous humanist and painter in Padua (end of the 15th century). He was presumably trained initially by his father, and may also have been a pupil of Titian, with whose workshop he was clearly associated.  Much of his early painting may be of landscape backgrounds in Titians.  He is mainly remembered for his prints and his drawings, especially of landscapes.  In his lifetime he was a successful painter, mostly in Padua (Giulio's home town), where he was mainly based from the early 1520s onwards, until his death there in 1564.  Mostly he painted on walls, including decorative schemes, but portraits and landscapes are also attributed to him.  His works as a painter are not highly regarded by modern art historians though some landscapes are of high quality. His engravings, fourteen of which are known, were produced in a short burst in 1517-18, when he was still in his teens; most are dated 1517. On some his name appears in full, on others, abbreviated ""Do.Cap"" or ""Do.Camp."" (for ""Domenico Campagnola"").  He appears to have cut his own blocks for his woodcuts, using a very different style from the professional cutters most artists employed.  Like his father he was a versatile and experimental artist.  His landscape drawings were produced as finished products for sale; he was one of the first artists to do this.  He may have included etching on some plates, including the Old soldier and shepherd.  His most successful prints include his Old soldier and shepherd [1], his Battle of naked men, and his Assumption. One engraving appears to have been begun by his father and completed by Domenico, perhaps after his father died.  He fell out seriously with Titian, perhaps as a result of the sharp practice which Peter Dreyer has discovered in recent years; it is thought to be Domenico who took very faint counter-proof impressions of some Titian woodcuts, which were then worked over in ink and passed off as Titian's preliminary drawings. This may well have played a part in bringing to an end Titian's first period of serious interest in making prints based on his work; it was to be some decades before he began collaborating with Cornelius Cort in producing engravings.  None of Campagnola's engravings are direct renderings of paintings by Titian, but many are similar in composition, though very different in handling, even allowing for the difference in medium. Many drawings long considered by Titian are now thought to be by Domenico, and attribution of many is still disputed, as some earlier drawings are disputed between his father Giulio, Titian, and Giorgione.  Drawings have also been reattributed from Domenico to Giulio Campagnola. He began by closely following the style of his father and Titian in producing landscapes with figures, but produced larger numbers, and made them directly for sale, so that it is largely through him that this influential typology became widely known.  According to James Byam Shaw:""In later drawings, Campagnola debased this style of landscape into a kind of facile mannerism; nevertheless he furnished inspiration for Italian draughtsmen for generations to come, including ... Agostino and Annibale Carracci, and Domenichino and Grimaldi later still.""    Most of his paintings have been destroyed.  Fresco paintings are to be seen in the Scuola del Santo at Padua and in Venice, marked by fresh animated colour and easy brilliant technique.  These are sometimes also attributed to his father.   A fine panel picture by him representing Adam and Eve is in the Pitti Palace, Florence.   "

His neighbor there turned out to be a student of Francesco Battaglioli. Chilone was introduced to him and accepted into his school.  Economic needs and family misfortunes led him to become an assistant to Alessandro Mauro, a theater architect and set designer. All of his work was done without credit. After Mauro's death, he tried briefly to work on his own but eventually accepted a position in Udine, collaborating with Antonio Mauro, to do the frescoes at a theater being decorated by the painter Giambattista Canal, whose eyesight was failing. He remained in Udine for some time and helped decorate the Palazzo Marcotti. He returned to Venice in 1815, virtually forgotten, and was forced to work for other painters. Most of his canvases were sold cheaply to middle-men, some of whom made a huge profit by passing them off as works by Canaletto. Perhaps in response to this, he began to display more stylistic autonomy. Soon, he enjoyed the patronage of the nobility. In 1824, he was elected a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia.

He was also one of the few early popes who favoured dialogue with Old Catholic Protestants and to this effect hoped to mend the schism with the Catholic Church that existed in England and the low countries. These efforts ultimately bore little fruit.       Carlo della Torre di Rezzonico was born in 1693 to a recently ennobled family of Venice, the second of two children of the man who bought the unfinished palace on the Grand Canal (now Ca' Rezzonico) and finished its construction. His parents were Giovanni Battista Rezzonico and Vittoria Barbarigo, and he had a brother called Aurelio. Carlo received a Jesuit education in Bologna and later studied at the University of Padua where he obtained his doctorate in canon law and civil law. From there, he travelled to Rome where he attended the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles. In 1716 Rezzonico became the Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura and in 1721 was appointed Governor of Fano. He was ordained to the priesthood on 23 December 1731 in Rome. Pope Clement XII appointed him to the cardinalate in 1737 as the Cardinal-Deacon of San Nicola in Carcere. He also filled various important posts in the Roman Curia.Rezzonico was chosen as Bishop of Padua in 1743 and he received episcopal consecration in Rome by Pope Benedict XIV himself, in the presence of Giuseppe Accoramboni and cardinal Antonio Saverio Gentili as co-consecrators. Rezzonico visited his diocese on frequent occasions and reformed the way that the diocese ran, paying attention to the social needs of the diocese. He was the first to do this in five decades. He later opted to become the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in 1747 and later still to become the Cardinal-Priest of San Marco in 1755.        Pope Benedict XIV died of gout in 1758 and the College of Cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in order to elect a successor. Direct negotiations between the rival factions resulted in the proposal for the election of Rezzonico. On the evening of 6 July 1758, Rezzonico received 31 votes out of a possible 44, one more than the required amount. He selected the pontifical name of ""Clement XIII"" in honor of Pope Clement XII, who elevated him to the cardinalate. Rezzonico was crowned as pontiff on 16 July 1758 by the protodeacon, Cardinal Alessandro Albani.    Notwithstanding the meekness and affability of his upright and moderate character, he was modest to a fault (he had the classical sculptures in the Vatican provided with mass-produced fig leaves) and generous with his extensive private fortune. He also permitted vernacular translations of the Bible in Catholic countries.    Clement XIII's pontificate was repeatedly disturbed by disputes respecting the pressures to suppress the Jesuits coming from the progressive Enlightenment circles of the philosophes in France. Clement XIII placed the Encyclopédie of D'Alembert and Diderot on the Index, but this index was not as effective as it had been in the previous century. More unexpected resistance came from the less progressive courts of Spain, the Two Sicilies, and Portugal. In 1758 the reforming minister of Joseph I of Portugal (1750–77), the Marquis of Pombal, expelled the Jesuits from Portugal, and transported them all to Civitavecchia, as a ""gift for the Pope."" In 1760, Pombal sent the papal nuncio home and recalled the Portuguese ambassador from the Vatican. The pamphlet titled the Brief Relation,  which claimed the Jesuits had created their own sovereign independent kingdom in South America and tyrannised the Native Americans, all in the interest of an insatiable ambition and avarice, did damage to the Jesuit cause as well.  On 8 November 1760, Clement XIII issued a Papal bull Quantum ornamenti, which approved the request of King Charles III of Spain to invoke the Immaculate Conception as the Patroness of Spain, along with its eastern and western territories, while continuing to recognize Saint James the Greater as co-patron. In France, the Parliament of Paris, with its strong upper bourgeois background and Jansenist sympathies, began its campaign to expel the Jesuits from France in the spring of 1761, and the published excerpts from Jesuit writings, the Extrait des assertions, provided anti-Jesuit ammunition (though, arguably, many of the statements the Extrait contained were made to look worse than they were through judicious omission of context). Though a congregation of bishops assembled at Paris in December 1761 recommended no action, Louis XV of France (1715–74) promulgated a royal order permitting the Society to remain in France, with the proviso that certain essentially liberalising changes in their institution satisfy the Parlement with a French Jesuit vicar-general who would be independent of the general in Rome. When the Parlement by the arrêt of 2 August 1762 suppressed the Jesuits in France and imposed untenable conditions on any who remained in the country, Clement XIII protested against this invasion of the Church's rights and annulled the arrêts. Louis XV's ministers could not permit such an abrogation of French law, and the King finally expelled the Jesuits in November 1764. Clement XIII warmly espoused the Jesuit order in a papal bull Apostolicum pascendi, 7 January 1765, which dismissed criticisms of the Jesuits as calumnies and praised the order's usefulness; it was largely ignored: by 1768 the Jesuits had been expelled from France, the Two Sicilies and Parma. In Spain, they appeared to be safe, but Charles III of Spain (1759–88), aware of the drawn-out contentions in Bourbon France, decided on a more peremptory efficiency. During the night of 2–3 April 1767, all the Jesuit houses of Spain were suddenly surrounded, the inhabitants arrested, shipped to the ports in the clothes they were wearing and bundled onto ships for Civitavecchia. The King's letter to Clement XIII promised that his allowance of 100 piastres each year would be withdrawn for the whole order, should any one of them venture at any time to write anything in self-defence or in criticism of the motives for the expulsion, motives that he refused to discuss, then or in the future. Much the same fate awaited them in the territories of the Bourbon Duke of Parma and Piacenza, advised by the liberal minister Guillaume du Tillot. In 1768, Clement XIII issued a strong protest (monitorium) against the policy of the Parmese government. The question of the investiture of Parma aggravated the Pope's troubles. The Bourbon Kings espoused their relative's quarrel, seized Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo, and united in a peremptory demand for the total suppression of the Jesuits (January 1769).Driven to extremes, Clement XIII consented to call a consistory to consider the step, but on the very eve of the day set for its meeting he died, not without suspicion of poison, of which, however, there appears to be no conclusive evidence.     Clement XIII backed plans to reunite the Catholic Church, with Old Catholic branches that split from Rome in 1724 over the issue of Papal authority, as well as with Protestants. This made little progress since Clement refused to compromise on doctrine with Protestants or on Papal authority with Old Catholics. In support of this policy, he recognised the Hanoverians as Kings of Great Britain despite the long-term residence in Rome of the Catholic House of Stuart. When James Francis Edward Stuart, aka James III died in 1766, Clement refused to recognise his son Charles Edward Stuart as Charles III, despite the objections of his brother Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart.    Clement XIII created 52 new cardinals in seven consistories in his pontificate. The pope created his nephew Carlo as a cardinal in his first consistory and later created Antonio Ganganelli - who would succeed him as Pope Clement XIV - as a cardinal. The pope approved the cultus for several individuals: Andrew of Montereale and Vincent Kadlubek on 18 February 1764, Angelus Agostini Mazzinghi on 7 March 1761, Antoine Neyrot on 22 February 1767, Augustine Novello in 1759, Elizabeth Achler on 19 July 1766, James Bertoni in 1766, Francesco Marinoni on 5 December 1764, Mattia de Nazarei on 27 July 1765, Sebastian Maggi on 15 April 1760 and Angela Merici on 30 April 1768. He formally beatified Beatrix of Este the Elder on 19 November 1763, Bernard of Corleone on 15 May 1768 and Gregorio Barbarigo on 6 July 1761. Clement XIII canonized four saints in his pontificate: Jerome Emiliani, Joseph Calasanz, Joseph of Cupertino, and Serafino of Montegranaro on 16 July 1767.    Clement XIII died during the night of 2 February 1769 in Rome of an apoplexy. He was laid to rest on 8 February 1769 in the Vatican but his remains were transferred on 27 September 1774 to a monument in the Vatican that had been sculpted by Antonio Canova at the request of Senator Abbondio Rezzonico, the nephew of the late pontiff.

"Pisana Conaro (died 10 March 1769), was a Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Alvise Giovanni Mocenigo (r. 1763–1779). Pisana Conaro was the daughter of Federico Conaro and married 5 October 1739. [SEP] Upon his election as doge, the spouse demanded to reintroduce the ceremony of the Solemn Entry of the dogaressa, as well as the other ceremonies surrounding her, rituals which had been abolished during the 17th century. The 22 April 1763, dogaressa Pisana therefore celebrated her entry followed by all the traditional rituals, such as to receive the representatives from the city guilds, with the exception of the coronation. These ceremonies attracted much attention and were seen as a sign that the former grandness of Venice should return. Pisana was described as a simple and retiring person, more interested in her household than in her role as dogaressa, who abhorred pomp and became popular for her involvement in charity. In 1766, she presided at the marriage of her son to Francesca Grimani. She was deeply affected by the early death of her daughter-in-law, and lost interest in public life. She spent much of her time at the country villa in Cordiguano, where she was popular as a good employer. In the work ""On the Character, Customs, and Female Mind"", the French academician Thomas described her: ""Let us mention a Venetian matron who was really wise, pious, and gifted with dignity as well as excellent qualities. She was not old when she died. People will at once perceive that I am alluding to Pisana Cornaro Mocenigo, whose nobleness of character, piety, and learning were unrivalled, and besides amusing herself with astronomical observations and natural history, took a singular pleasure in the study of anatomy, in which she made such great progress that she excited the admiration of the illustrious Frotomedico Santorini, and also of the immortal Giambattista Morgagni, prince of the anatomists of our time. We have scattered these few flowers on the tomb of the late renowned Dogaressa, although her happy spirit is sufficiently requited by the tribute of tears and constant regret offered to her memory by her loving husband, H. Serene H. Alvise Mocenigo."" After her death, her spouse remarried Polissena Contarini Da Mula in 1771, though she does not seem to have played to part of dogaressa in a ceremonial sense as much as did Pisana Conaro, though she did become the center of the literary circle her consort gathered on his private villa.

"Alvise Contarini (April 23, 1597 — March 11, 1651) was a patrician and diplomat of the Republic of Venice. [SEP]    Born in Venice, Alvise Contarini entered the service of the Republic of Venice in 1618, and by 1623, he had risen to such prominence that he was elected to the Grand Council of the Republic. His diplomatic career began with a posting as ambassador to the Dutch Republic. In 1626, he was named ambassador to England and in 1629 he moved on to become ambassador to France where he succeeded in persuading King Louis XIII to enter into an alliance with Venice in order to prevent troops of the Austrian Habsburgs from occupying the Valtellina. He also played a crucial role in persuading Cardinal Richelieu that France should back Sweden's intervention in the Thirty Years' War in 1630. In 1632, he was named ambassador to the papal court, before traveling to Constantinople where he was bailo from 1636 to 1641.In 1641, Venice sent Contarini to the Congress of Münster. In this capacity, he spent the next seven years attempting to negotiate the end of the Thirty Years' War, a process that ultimately ended in the Peace of Westphalia. Contarini was particularly important in this process in that he was seen as a neutral party, who had the confidence of all parties. Since the chief papal negotiator, Cardinal Fabio Chigi, refused to meet with Protestant princes, whom he considered to be heretics. Contarini served as an intermediary between the cardinal and the Protestants during the negotiations. He died in Venice in 1651.    The Contarini Institute for Mediation of the FernUniversität Hagen is named in Contarini's honour.   "
"Ambrogio Contarini (1429 – 1499) was a Venetian nobleman, merchant and diplomat known for an account of his travel to Iran. [SEP]  Ambrogio Contarini was a member of the patrician family of Contarini and spent his youth in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople as a merchant. He left the city after the Ottoman–Venetian war began in 1463. In 1470, he was aboard the Aegeus, fighting the Ottomans at sea. The Republic of Venice sought to forge a larger alliance against the Ottoman Empire and sent Contarini with a diplomatic mission to Uzun Hassan, the Iranian ruler of the Aq Qoyunlu clan. He left Venice in February 1474, traveled through central Europe, Kiev, and Georgia and reached Tabriz in August 1474. In October, he met Uzun Hassan at his capital of Isfahan. He was kindly received, but the Venetian proposal of alliance was declined. Contarini returned to Venice only in April 1477, after many delays and a difficult return voyage. On his journey home from Iran, Contarini stopped in Moscow, where he had an audience with the Russian tsar Ivan III.On the day of his arrival in Venice, Contarini orally reported to the Council of the Republic. His report was published in Venice in 1476 by H. Foxius as Questo e el Viazo de misier Ambrogio Contarini. A written account of his mission appeared in print in 1486 in Vicenza. Contarini's itinerary is dominated by his own personal vicissitudes, but contains many valuable information about the regions he visited, especially Iran under Uzun Hassan's rule.   "
"Gasparo Contarini (16 October 1483 – 24 August 1542) was an Italian diplomat, cardinal and Bishop of Belluno. [SEP] He was one of the first proponents of the dialogue with Protestants, after the Reformation.    He was born in Venice, the eldest son of Alvise Contarini, of the ancient noble House of Contarini, and his wife Polissena Malpiero.  After a thorough scientific and philosophical training at the University of Padua, he began his career in the service of his native city. From September 1520 to August 1525 he was the Republic's ambassador to Charles V, with whom Venice was soon at war, instructed to defend the Republic's alliance with Francis I of France. Though he participated at the Diet of Worms, April 1521, he never saw or spoke with Martin Luther. He accompanied Charles in the Netherlands and Spain. Contarini was in Spain when the Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation returned in 1522, bringing with them a cargo of spices from the East as well as a scientific curiosity. Although the sailors had carefully recorded every day of the three-year journey since they left Seville, the ship's log was one day earlier than the actual date when they returned to Seville. Contarini was the first European to give a correct explanation of this phenomenon. Since the ship had sailed westward around the world, in the same direction as the apparent motion of the sun in the sky, the sailors had experienced one fewer sunrise than a stationary observer. He participated at the Congress of Ferrara in 1526 as the Republic's representative; at the Congress the League of Cognac was formed against the Emperor, allying France with Venice and several states of Italy. Later, after the Sack of Rome (1527), he assisted in reconciling the emperor with Clement VII, whose release he had obtained, and with the Republic of Bologna. Upon his return to Venice, he was made a senator and a member of the Great Council.    In 1535, Paul III unexpectedly made the secular diplomat a cardinal in order to bind an able man of evangelical disposition to the Roman interests. Contarini accepted, but in his new position did not exhibit his former independence. At the time he was promoted to cardinal, May 21, 1535, he was still a layman. However, already in October 1536 he was appointed Bishop of Belluno One of the fruits of his diplomatic activity is his De magistratibus et republica Venetorum. As Cardinal, Contarini figured among the most prominent of the Spirituali, the leaders of the movement for reform within the Roman church. In April 1536 Paul III appointed a commission to devise ways for a reformation, with Contarini presiding. Paul III received favorably Contarini's Consilium de Emendanda Ecclesia, which was circulated among the cardinalate, but it remained a dead letter.  Contarini in a letter to his friend Cardinal Reginald Pole (dated 11 November 1538) says that his hopes had been wakened anew by the pope's attitude. He and his friends, who formed the Catholic evangelical movement of the Spirituali, thought that all would have been done when the abuses in church life had been put away. What Contarini had to do with it is shown by his letters to the pope in which he complained of the schism in the church, of simony and flattery in the papal court, but above all of papal tyranny, its least grateful passages. Paul's successor Paul IV, once a member on the commission, in 1539 put it on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. In 1541 Cardinal Contarini was papal legate at the Conference of Regensburg, the diet and religious debate marking the culmination of attempts to restore religious unity in Germany by means of conferences. There everything was unfavorable; the Catholic states were bitter, the Evangelicals were distant. Contarini's instructions though apparently free were in fact full of papal reservations. But the papal party had gladly sent him, thinking that through him a union in doctrine could be brought about, while the interest of Rome could be attended to later. Though the princes stood aloof, the theologians and the emperor were for peace, so the main articles were put forth in a formula, Evangelical in thought and Catholic in expression. The papal legate had revised the Catholic proposal and assented to the formula agreed upon. All gave their approval, even Johann Eck, though he later regretted it. Contarini's theological advisor was Tommaso Badia; his own position is shown in a treatise on justification, composed at Regensburg, which in essential points is Evangelical, differing only in the omission of the negative side and in being interwoven with the teaching of Aquinas. Meanwhile, the papal policy had changed, and Contarini was compelled to follow his leader. He advised the emperor, after the conference had broken up, not to renew it, but to submit everything to the pope. Ignatius Loyola acknowledged that Cardinal Contarini was largely responsible for the papal approbation of the Society of Jesus,  on September 27, 1540. Meanwhile, Rome had drifted further into reaction, and Contarini died while legate at Bologna, at a time when the Inquisition had driven many of his friends and fellows in conviction into exile.     Contarini's book De magistratibus et republica venetorum (Paris, 1543) is an important source for the study of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Venice's unique system of government. It was published in an English translation in 1599. This magisterial work, written during his time as an ambassador to Charles V, extols the various institutions of the Venetian state in a manner designed to emphasize harmony, fairness and serenity. Historians have demonstrated that this text represents Contarini's idealization of Venetian reality. Probably written for a foreign, courtly audience, this work functions as the source for the everlasting propagation of the ""myth of Venice"" as a stable, unchanging and prosperous society. His depiction of how members of the council were elected to the senate, for example, aimed to emphasise the way the electoral system prevented factionalism from occurring, instead making sure that “public benefits are largely extended among the citizens” rather than narrowly amongst “one family” . An elaborate lottery is described as giving the maximum amount of chance in appointing patricians to particular offices, and care is taken to point out if two of one family are standing for similar posts. Fairness is further emphasised in Contarini's constant references to the equality the members of the council enjoyed. They “sit down where it pleases them, for there is no place appointed to any”, and they “with oath promise to do their utmost diligence, that the laws may be observed” . He creates an image of disparate individuals, with factions broken up by the guiding hand of the law, working to ensure those in positions of importance are fairly chosen from their number and without the capacity to serve the interests of a smaller group. Contarini's depiction of the Doge lucidly demonstrates the way in which this figure embodies both the conscious illusion of a resplendent monarchical ruler and an equally conscious demonstration of a regime that wishes to portray itself as ruled by many limiting the powers of one. This calculated duality means that Contarini's doge, which the second book of De magistratibus is almost entirely devoted to discussing, represents the closest point in his text to what actually occurred, because the Doge served as a literal embodiment of the idealisation of the reality of Venetian politics. For Contarini, this duality almost defines the greatness of the Venetian constitution. The Doge is the “heart”, under which “all are comprised” . Contarini places him in the centre of his body metaphor, making him synecdochical for the city and the people that reside within it. This means he is to ensure that the disparate, competing interests of the city beat in time with one another, creating in the process the “perfection of civil agreement”. His job as a conductor, rather than a ruler, means therefore that the role takes on the aspect of representative of the entire city. Contarini's description of his vestments, privileges and rituals can therefore be compared to Marin Sanudo’s description of the physical spaces of Venice in his essay In Praise of Venice. Both are designed to extol the virtues of the entire city by describing representative parts. This is apparent in the way both authors treat the chapel of St. Mark. Patron saints were hugely important in terms of civic self-identification in renaissance Italy . Contarini emphasizes this, saying that he is “with exceeding honour solemnized of the Venetians” . His description of the Doge's close relationship with the saint, through the “solemn pomp”  with which he attends mass at the saint's chapel, attaches him to the aforementioned “exceeding honour”, in a similar fashion to the way in which Sanudo glorifies Venice as a whole by constantly referring to the beauty and worth of St. Mark's square and chapel as part of his panoramic praise of the city. At the same time, however, Contarini's overall purpose is, of course, the glorification of the republican nature of his city. Therefore, he cannot avoid referring to “the other side” of the Doge's figure when discussing his “royal appearing show”  . Things like the “kingly ornaments” which were “always purple garments or cloth of gold”, both very ostentatious assertions of wealth and power, were to ensure he was “recompensed” for his “limitation of authority” . Contarini thus openly concludes that the Doge is a combination of myth and reality, saying that “in everything you may see the show of a king, but his authority is nothing” . Indeed, as Edward Muir points out, “by the sixteenth century virtually every word, gesture and act that the doge made in public was subject to legal and ceremonial regulation” . He could not buy expensive jewels, own property outside Venice or the Veneto, display his insignia outside the Ducal Palace, decorate his apartment as he wanted, receive people in his ducal dress, send official letters, or have close ties with guilds, amongst a great many other restrictions. Legally, therefore, power in Venice came from the numerous councils, not the figurehead. The Doge thus becomes a brazen republican statement. Venice drew attention to a princely, magnificently adorned figurehead, only to direct most executive power to councils of her citizens.    Pope Paul III   "
"Giovanni Contarini (1549–1605) was an Italian painter of the late Renaissance. [SEP]    Born in Venice, Contarini was a contemporary of Palma il Giovane. He was a great student of the works of Tintoretto and Titian and is declared to have been an exact imitator of Titian. According to an old story he was so extremely accurate in his portraits that on ""sending home one he had taken of Marco Dolce, his dogs began to fawn upon it, mistaking it for their master"". Contarini's work is extremely mannered, soft and sweet, but distinguished by beautiful, rich coloring and executed very much on the lines of Titian's painting. His finest picture is in the Louvre, having been removed from the ducal palace at Venice, and represents the Virgin and Child with St Mark and St Sebastian, and the Doge of Venice, Marino Grimani, kneeling before them. Other paintings of his are in the galleries at Berlin, Florence, Milan, and Vienna, and in many of the churches at Venice. He painted easel-pictures of Greek and Roman mythological subjects, which are treated with propriety and discretion but are peculiarly lacking in force and strength; in many of the palaces in Venice he decorated ceilings.  Some years of his life were passed at the court of the Emperor Rudolf II, with whom he was a great favorite and by whom he was knighted. His work has been described by one writer as a ""combination of sugar, cream, mulberry juice, sunbeam and velvet"", but the criticism is a little unjust and one or two of his works, for example the ""Resurrection"" in the church of San Francesco di Paola at Venice, can claim to be masterly.

In 1607, he was appointed Governor of Civitavecchia.    In February 1623, he was elected Bishop of Bergamo, but retained the clericate of the Apostolic Chamber, and was consecrated in April by Cardinal Marcantonio Gozzadini. Three years later he was elevated to Cardinal by Pope Urban VIII and was installed as Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Traspontina and appointed Bishop of Venice. His elevation was not without controversy as the Republic of Venice prohibited any son of a Doge from accepting a papal appointment. Eventually, the Venetian senate approved the promotion but refused to approve his proposed appointments as Bishop of Vicenza or Bishop of Padua. Cornaro was appointed Cardinal-Priest of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in 1627 and San Marco in 1629 before being promoted to Patriarch of Venice in June 1631, a position he held until 1644. In the intervening period, he was appointed Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals from 1639 to 1641.

"Antonio Corradini (19 October 1688 – 12 August 1752) was an Italian Rococo sculptor from Venice. [SEP] He is best known for his illusory veiled depictions of women where the contours of their face and body beneath the veil are discernible. Born in Venice, Corradini spent much of his career as a migrant artist traveling to locations across Europe including Dresden, Prague, and Saint Petersburg to complete commissions. He spent over a decade in Vienna where he was court sculptor for Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. After a brief stint in Rome, he died in Naples.       Much of the information on Corradini's early life is contradictory, including his date of birth. According to recent scholarship, he was the son of Gerolamo Corradini, a professional veler (packer of sails for ships), and his wife Barbara, and born in the parish of SS. Vito and Modesto.  His family was modest. Corradini was apprenticed to the sculptor Antonio Tarsia (1663 - ca 1739), for whom he worked probably for four or five years starting at the age of fourteen or fifteen (this was the norm at the time). He later became Tarsia's son-in-law.     Corradini seems to have come into his own as a sculptor around 1709. That year he was employed on work for the façade of the church of San Stae in Venice. Two years later, in 1711, he was recorded as having been enrolled in the Arte dei Tagliapietra as one of the sculptors. By 1713 he had finally set up his own workshop and was working on the state of St. Anastasia in Zara for the church of San Donato.  Corradini's commissions for the next several years came from patrons all over Eastern Europe. In 1716-17, he completed eighteen busts and two statues for the summer garden of the Russian czar Peter the Great in St. Petersburg, and the first of his famous veiled women; he would complete two more in the city in 1722. Sometime in 1718 or 1719 he was commissioned to execute a monument to Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, Marshal of the Venetian forces for the defence of island of Corfu. In 1718 he completed an altar for the Cathedral of Rovigo, and in 1720 he was paid for a signed altar dedicated to the Blessed Hemma, installed in the crypt. Corradini completed the outdoor marble statuary group, Nessus and Deianira (1718–1723), for the Grosser Garten in Dresden. The Apollo Flaying Marsyas and Zephyrus and Flora (1723-1728) are two life-sized marble sculptures originally commissioned by the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, Augustus the Strong for the gardens of the Höllandisches Palais in Dresden (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London). It was also at this time that Corradini married Maria Tarsia.  In 1723, Corradini reputedly became the first person to legally separate the art of sculptors from the profession of stonemasons, forming part of a college that was established in 1724. He was faced with the task of guiding the new artistic profession through its infancy. In 1725-26 he was appointed curator of the laws of the institution and became its prior in 1727.  In the mid-1720s Corradini was awarded a number of commissions in Italy. He completed a number of sculptures for the Manin monument in the Cathedral of Udine and the church of San Giacomo di Udine and the altar of the Blessed Sacrament in the cathedral of Este (1722–1725), which was his work entirely. From 1724-1728 he worked in Venice on the restoration of the stairway and the sculptures of the Doge's Palace and the facade of the clock tower in the Piazza San Marco. After his wax model was chosen by the Signoria, between 1719-1729 Corradini supervised the reconstruction of the bucintoro and completed a few wood carvings for it.     In 1729-30, Corradini moved to Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire of the Habsburgs, where he was named court sculptor in 1733 and awarded a salary of 1700 florins a year and a housing allowance of 500 florins. He would be based there through the early 1740s. Emperor Charles VI entrusted him with the realization of the Bundesladendenkmal, or monument of the Ark of the Covenant, in Győr, in what is now northwestern Hungary, and in 1735 he worked after a drawing of Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach on a modelleto for tomb of St. Johann Nepomuk in Prague, executed by the silversmith Johann Joseph Würth in St. Vitus Cathedral of the Prague Castle.  Corradini completed a large number of works in Vienna itself during these years. Charles VI employed him in the decoration of the Josephbrunnen and, later, Corradini sculpted four figures for the two side altars below the dome of the Karlskirche and designed and supervised the construction of a wooden theater for animal fights called the Hetztheater. In 1736, together with Antonio Galli Bibbiena, he was named court designer for the bullfights that were held there, and on 14 April 1738 an imperial decree appointed Galli Bibbiena, Corradini, and Antonio Lopez jointly to the post of managers of the theater, which was used until 1749.    On the death of Emperor Charles VI in 1740 and his wife in 1741, and the death of Fischer von Erlach in 1742, Georg Raphael Donner became the most prominent sculptor in Vienna. Corradini entered a period of crisis. In 1740 he briefly visited Rome, then in late 1742 he returned first to Venice and then to Rome, where shared room and board with Giovanni Battista Piranesi, even though Empress Maria Theresa reconfirmed him as court sculptor. On 23 January 1743 Corradini asked permission to stay in Rome permanently with the option of returning to Vienna.  In Rome, he devoted himself to sculpting the Vestal Virgin Tuccia, achieved without a commission from any patron (it remained unsold), and was involved in the problem of the restoration of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. Corradini designed eight models of colossal statues with which it was proposed to place at the foot of the drum of the dome make it more resistant. He also sculpted a bust of Pope Benedict XIV and other minor works.     In 1744 Corradini moved to Naples to oversee the sculptural renovation of the Sansevero Chapel (Capella Sansevero de' Sangri or Pietatella) at the request of Raimondo di Sangro, Prince of Sansevero VII. Corradini's work on the chapel is a very complex and intricate decoration of statues, pedestals, altar frontals, round and bas-reliefs, for which he prepared 36 bozzetti in clay. In 1750, he completed Veiled Truth (also called Modesty or Chastity), a tomb monument dedicated to Cecilia Gaetani dell'Aquila d'Aragona, mother of Raimondo di Sangro. Not only is it a technically inspired work, but the conceit of modesty shielded by the flimsiest of veils creates an alluring but ironic tension, perhaps one somewhat unmerited for a chapel funerary monument, but one that does compel remembrance. Corradini died suddenly on 12 August 1752 in Naples. He was buried there in the parish church of Santa Maria della Rotonda on the same day. Because the work in Sansevero Chapel was incomplete, Raimondo di Sangro commissioned Francesco Queirolo to oversee the remaining work based on Corradini's bozzetti. Starting from a bozzetto by Corradini that is now preserved in the Certosa di San Martino, another artist working on the project Giuseppe Sanmartino sculpted the Christ Veiled under a Shroud using the same artifice of ""veiled"" marble.

"Gregorio Correr (Corraro) (1409 – 1464) was an Italian humanist and ecclesiastic from Venice. [SEP] In the last year of his life he was elected Patriarch of Venice.     He was born into a patrician family of Venice; Antonio Correr was his uncle. As a youth he studied in the school of Vittorino da Feltre in Mantua.  Correr was created protonotary apostolic by Pope Eugenius IV, a relation. He went with the Curia to Florence, where he encountered the humanist circle of Biondo Flavio. He corresponded with Lapo da Castiglionchio the Younger.He then served as secretary to his uncle Antonio at the Council of Basle. From 1448 he was an abbot at the Basilica of San Zeno, Verona. There he received the visit of another pupil of Vittorino, Iacopo da San Cassiano. He commissioned the celebrated San Zeno Altarpiece from Andrea Mantegna. He was nominated as bishop of Padua in 1459, but lost out to Pietro Barbo when Pope Pius II refused to accept the Venetian Senate's choice.   "

"Dom Anselmo Costadoni, O.S.B. Cam., [SEP] (1714–1785) was an Italian Camaldolese monk, historian and theologian.    He was born on 6 October 1714, at Venice and christened Giovanni Domenico. The son of a rich merchant, he sacrificed at an early date his prospects of success in the world and took the religious habit of the Camaldolese monks at the Monastery of St. Michael, situated on the island of Murano in the Venetian lagoon. Here he studied philosophy and theology with more than usual success. At the age of twenty-three he revealed his literary ability in a letter (Lettera critica) written in defense of certain Camaldolese writers, who had been attacked by Giusto Fontanini in his ""Library of Italian Eloquence"". Costadoni subsequently collaborated for eighteen years with the learned Dom Gian Benedetto Mittarelli of his monastery in the publication of the ""Annales Camaldulenses ordinis S. Benedicti, ab anno 907 ad annum 1770"" (The Annals of the Camaldolese of the Order of St. Benedict, 907-1770), printed in 9 volumes folio (Venice, 1755–73). It follows the plan of Mabillon's ""Annales ordinis S. Benedicti"". (Venice, 1755–73). He died on 23 January 1785, in Venice.   "
"Giovanni Francesco Crivelli (20 September 1690 in Venice – 20 September 1743) was a Venetian priest. [SEP] Crivelli was a priest member of the Somasco holy order in the Cloister of the Health, before becoming provincial Father of the order and rector of the Seminar of Murano.    He published two teaching books, the Elements of Numeral and Literal Arithmetic (published in Venice in 1728), and the Elements of Physics (published in Venice in 1731 and subsequently broadened in 1744).  His original manuscripts are lost. The second book is particularly important for a number of reasons. It is a popular teaching book whose first volume contains material still used today in High School science classes (with the exception of electro-magnetic phenomena, considered at that time as little more than a novelty phenomenon). The book also discusses astronomical matters. The book notes the full reception of the physics of Galileo and of Newton with Galileo called ""the prince of the scientists"", and a full recognition of the importance of the Arabic Muslim civilisation in the creation of the scientific method.  The explanation of the scientific method coincides practically with the positions of neopositivism and of scientific realism.  The writing style is innovative and still relevant for its use of the Italian language, for the detailed and precise descriptions of many experiments, including those carried out outside Europe, and for demonstrating the varied hypotheses of scientists related to arguments under discussion in those years. Also of note is the recognition of the existence of theoretical physics, and its equal importance alongside experimental physics.His activity was also highly valued outside of Italy. Crivelli was elected in January 1734 as a Fellow of the Royal Society (his books are in the library of the Royal Society). After his death, he was soon forgotten and his work was only recently re-discovered."
"Giovanna Margherita Dalmet, also called Delmaz and Dalmaz (1739 – 11 January 1817), was a Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Paolo Renier (r. 1779–1789).       Margherita was born in Constantinople as the daughter of the apothecary Giovanni Battista from Piemonte. [SEP] She was a widow of a man by the name Bassi and active as a tight rope dancer in Constantinople, where she met Paolo Renier, who was there on a diplomatic mission between 1769-1773.  Renier was by that time a widower after his first wife Giustina Donà (d. 1751), and they became lovers and married.  According to another version, he had her placed to be educated in a Catholic orphanage for poor girls, after which they fell in love and married.  Due to the dislike of the Venetian aristocracy of their marriage, it was not recorded in the Golden Book.  Secretary of State Giuseppe Gradenigo described the role of the new doges marriage in his election:   "" At noon on Friday his Serene Excellency Paolo Renier's election was declared. The newly made prince must have spent much money. He has purchased the balle for more than fifteen zecchini each, and of these there are about three hundred. He started with the idea that it would be an easy matter, but whilst engaged in it he heard himself called a traitor to his country, deceitful, and married to a plebeian woman of bad character, formerly a rope-dancer – words which seemed to resound on all sides, and undoubtedly excited the people against him ... He was obliged to make a virtue of necessity, and to draw out a large number of those 90,000 zecchini that he is supposed to have made at Constantinople, in order to stop people's mouths. And in the end the public was fully satisfied. During three days' feasting in the Palace, money, bread, and wine were profusely distributed, and produced loud hurrahs and acclamations.""    Because of her past, she was not accepted by the Venetian aristocracy, who referred to her as La Falsa Dogaressa ('The False Dogaressa').   The candidacy of Andrea Tron to the office of Doge had been damaged by the scandals of his noble wife Caterina Tron, and Delmaz would have been even less accepted in the role of dogaressa, as she could not be inscribed in the Golden Book.  Nevertheless, she was acknowledged as dogaressa and given the title as such.  However she refrained nonetheless from playing that role in official ceremonies, and the representational duties of the dogaressa was performed by the niece of her spouse, Giustina Renier Michiel.  In June 1786, she visited the waters of Recoaro in Valdagno as dogaressa under the treatment of Doctor Girolamo Festari.  As dogaressa, she let out the pavement of the della Paglia bridge, for artists' shops, and obtained 1,000 zecchini for letting the  Priorato della Gadi Bio.  Margherita was said to damage the reputation and popularity of the doge.  Margherita is known for a story about her dislike of the sound of church bells: her consort allegedly paid the abbey near the doge palace not to ring the bells, and whenever he was late with the payment, the convent rang the bells.Margherita was involved in a case of counterfeit as the accused.  On 3 October 1786, during his stay in Venice, Goethe witnessed the public trial against her in the Ducal Palace.  The case was about a deed of trust, and the lawsuit was against the Doge, but in reality against the dogaressa, who was in fact present on the bench of the accused, dressed in the robes of the dogaressa.  Goethe describes her as ""woman of a certain age, of a noble appearance; she had a handsome face, but a severe expression, and a certain air of melancholy!""    Margherita Dalmet was widowed in 1789, and left the Ducal Palace.  She remarried the Venetian aristocrat Federico Bonlini who was reportedly her lover during her time as dogaressa, but the Venetian aristocracy again refused to record her marriage in the Golden Book.   She evidently lived a peaceful life after the death of Renier.  In her will of 1817 she left a great deal of her fortune to charity.   "
"Enrico Dandolo (anglicised as Henry Dandolo and Latinized as Henricus Dandulus; c. 1107 – May 1205) was the 41st Doge of Venice from 1192 until his death. [SEP] He is remembered for his avowed piety, longevity, and shrewdness, and is known for his role in the Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople.       Born in Venice c. 1107, Enrico Dandolo was a member of the socially and politically prominent Dandolo family. He was the son of the powerful jurist and member of the ducal court, Vitale Dandolo, and had two brothers: Andrea and Giovanni. His uncle, also named Enrico Dandolo, was patriarch of Grado.Not much information exists on the younger Enrico before his father's death in 1174. This is because Vitale lived into his nineties and his sons were not emancipated until he died. Though Enrico was himself an elderly man at around 67, he was still under filial subjection. This was a type of partial emancipation in which he could conduct business, but because he worked for the family, most, if not all, documents used Vitale's name rather than Enrico's.Dandolo's first important political roles took place during the crisis years of 1171 and 1172, which were a tumultuous period between the Byzantine and Venetian empires. After Byzantine emperor Manuel Comnenus restored Pisans and Genoans, both enemies of the Venetians, to their quarters in Constantinople as part of his plan to reclaim Italy, an angry Venetian mob attacked the recently reinstated Genoese quarter. This attack caused Comnenus in March 1171 to order the seizure of goods and imprisonment of thousands of Venetians living in the empire. Popular Venetian anger with the attack forced Doge Vitale II Michiel to gather a retaliatory expedition, which included Dandolo. This expedition fell apart when its participants were struck by plague in 1172, and upon his return Michiel was killed by a mob of Venetians, angry with his defeat.The succeeding doge, Sebastiano Ziani, sought to form alliances with enemies of the Byzantine empire so that it would feel pressured into coming to terms with Venice. He sent out multiple expeditions to Constantinople and King William II's court in Sicily, several of which Dandolo was a part, although he never met with William. Despite Dandolo's failure to meet with William II, his constant participation in these envoys shows his value and importance within the ducal court, qualities which no doubt contributed to his election as doge in 1192. Dandolo also made trips to Constantinople in 1183 and 1184. The first voyage, on which he embarked with his brother, Giovanni, was the first in which he acted as a ducal legate. On this trip, he most likely engaged in negotiations for reparations of the city's Venetian quarter with the new Byzantine emperor Andronicus I. He also invested and restored land to Venetian monasteries, a deed which earned him the position of legal advocate for the monastery of San Cipriano di Murano.In 1184, Dandolo, serving again as a ducal legate along with Pietro Ziani and Domenico Sanudo, returned to Constantinople to negotiate the restoration of the Venetian quarter with Andronicus. In this meeting, the emperor at last agreed to release the imprisoned Venetians, restore their quarter, and pay for reparations.    On 1 June 1192, after Orio Mastropietro abdicated the throne, Dandolo became the forty-first Doge of Venice. He was the second doge to be chosen by a council of forty electors. Already aged and blind, but deeply ambitious, he displayed tremendous energy and mental capacity. His remarkable deeds over the next eleven years have led some to hypothesize that he actually may have been in his mid seventies when he became Venice's leader. None of the earlier chronicles and contemporary witnesses give his exact age, only mentioning that he was very old. The commonly given birth year of c. 1107 is based on the account of Marino Sanuto the Younger (1466 – 1536) three centuries later, who stated that Dandolo was eighty-five when he assumed the throne. Though not the first doge to take the promissione ducale, Dandolo's is the earliest that is available to historians.One of Dandolo's first decrees as doge was to evict all foreigners who had lived in Venice for fewer than two years on 16 August 1192. Landlords were obligated to evict any of these foreigners from their premises. Citizens who violated the decree had to pay fifty lire, and foreigners’ goods were confiscated. Additionally, Venetians were not allowed to lend money to foreigners—excepting those from the areas of Umana or Ragusa—for a period that exceeded fifteen days. The reason why this decree was implemented is unknown, but it seems to correlate to a recent increase of foreigners into Venice, since it did not affect foreigners who had been living in the city for more than two years.In 1193, Dandolo commanded an attack on the nearby city of Zara, which for years had troubled Venice and threatened its control over the Dalmatian Coast. Until 1180, Zara had been under Venetian control, until they staged a successful rebellion in which they became the sole city on this coast that was against Venetian interests. Dandolo seemed to have always supported Venice's reinstating power over the city, since he had contributed money to doge Orio Mastropiero's 1187 military attempt to regain control there. Dandolo's 1193 attack on Zara was only somewhat successful. He managed to regain control over the islands of Pago, Ossero, and Arbe, which had been lost in an 1190 attempt led by Mastropiero, though not Zara.In 1194, Dandolo enacted important reforms to the Venetian currency system. Before these reforms, Venice's principal coin was the silver penny, which weighed less than a gram and was about one-quarter fine. Due to the debasement of the silver penny in 1180 and the constant fluctuation in value of Jerusalem and Byzantine coins, Dandolo instated three denominations of this silver penny, the bianco (half-penny), the quartarolo (quarter-penny), and the silver grosso. The bianco had a silver content of about five percent, and was decorated with a cross on one side and St. Mark on the other. The quartarolo had almost no precious metal content, which made it the first European token coin since ancient Rome. The grosso was the first nearly pure silver–and high denomination–coin minted in western Europe in over five centuries. It was decorated with an image of Dandolo and St. Mark on one side, and of Jesus Christ enthroned on the other side, which imitated a design typically seen on Byzantine aspron trachy coins. The grosso eventually became the dominant coin of Mediterranean commerce.    In 1202, six French envoys of the Fourth Crusade arrived in Venice in hopes of acquiring a fleet and supplies. Dandolo arranged meetings for them with the ducal court, in which the council calculated the expenses necessary for this voyage, which would be the largest project in Venetian history. The terms were laid out as such: for up to a year, Venice would provide transportation and most provisions for the army. Four silver marks would be paid for each knight and horse, and two would be paid for each other member. Finally, many Venetians would also join the Crusade and promised to supply fifty fully armed galleys as long as the French promised to split the spoils with them. With the enthusiastic support of the population, Venice's participation in the Crusade was confirmed. Dandolo himself swore on holy relics to uphold every part of the agreement.However, Venice soon faced a financial problem. The six original Crusaders had borrowed money as a down payment for the fleet, but failed to pay it back. When more Crusaders began to arrive that June, the urgency for this money increased as many Venetians, whose business relied on this reimbursement, were being driven closer to financial ruin. When the due date for payment arrived, Dandolo ordered the Crusaders, who were staying on the nearby Lido, to collectively pay 85,000 marks. Even when everyone, including many poor Crusaders, contributed all they could afford, they still owed 34,000 marks. Instead of ejecting them, Dandolo decided to lend this amount from the Venetian state, provided that it was paid back in the form of the spoils of the Crusade. In addition, Dandolo proposed that the Crusaders agree to spend the winter in Zara. This was due to the threat of Zaran pirates to Venetian commerce as well as the Venetian's interest in regaining control over the area. Additionally, staking an interest in Zara helped convince the Great Council to consent to Dandolo's plan.The Crusade fleet left Venice during the first week of October 1202, following an emotional and rousing ceremony in San Marco di Venezia where Dandolo ""took the cross"" –committed himself to crusading–and promised to ""go live or die"" with the Crusaders in exchange for his people's support, and his sons' taking his place during his absence. The Crusaders arrived in Zara in November, the sheer size of their fleet intimidating the Zarans into near surrender. Dandolo gave the Zarans an ultimatum: either they leave the city right away or they would be killed. Confusion ensued, as Pope Innocent forbade the Crusade from settling this dispute unrelated to their original religious agenda, especially since the land was controlled by King Emeric of Hungary, who had himself participated in a crusade. Finally, Innocent threatened excommunication to anyone who antagonized the Zarans. The Crusaders attacked the city anyway, and it at last fell on 24 November 1202. All of the Venetian members of the Crusade were thus excommunicated (the French Crusaders had sent an envoy to the pope to ask for forgiveness), but Dandolo kept this a secret from them since he knew they would abandon the Crusade if they found out.Shortly afterwards, Alexius Angelus, son of the deposed Byzantine emperor Isaac II, arrived in Zara, looking for help to overthrow his uncle, Alexius III, after he violently seized the throne from Isaac. Dandolo agreed to the Crusade leaders' plan to place Alexius Angelus on the throne of the Byzantine Empire in return for his support and funds to help the Crusade. The Crusaders thus took another detour to Constantinople, where the conquest and sack of Constantinople took place on 12 April 1204. During the looting, Dandolo had many items of value sent back to Venice, including the four Horses of St. Mark that decorate the Venetian cathedral to this day. When Constantinople fell, Dandolo understood that he needed to quickly restore stability to the empire to avoid disorder that could threaten Venice. One necessary task was to find an emperor for the new Latin empire. Dandolo was offered the position, but he refused, and Baldwin of Flanders instead took the throne.The Partitio Romaniae also resulted from this conquest, and it awarded Venice three-eighths of the Byzantine Empire in accordance with an agreement drafted by the Crusaders before the fall of the empire. This included a part of Constantinople near the harbor, a portion of the shoreline of the Sea of Marmara, and the city of Adrianople, among other former Byzantine possessions. Dandolo was also awarded the title ""lord of three-eighths of the Roman Empire"", although these acquisitions only lasted until the collapse of the Latin empire in 1261. Dandolo died in 1205 and was buried in June in the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. In the 19th century an Italian restoration team placed a cenotaph marker near the probable location, which is still visible today. The marker is frequently mistaken by tourists as being a medieval marker of the actual tomb of the doge. The real tomb was destroyed by the Ottomans after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 and subsequent conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque.    It is not known for certain when and how Dandolo became blind. According to the Chronicle of Novgorod he had been blinded by the Byzantines during the 1171 expedition to Byzantium. Supposedly, Emperor Manuel Comnenus ""ordered his eyes to be blinded with glass; and his eyes were uninjured, but he saw nothing"". According to Thomas F. Madden's study, Dandolo suffered from cortical blindness as a result of a severe blow to the back of the head received sometime between 1174 and 1176. Documents show Dandolo's signature being fully legible in 1174 but sprawling across the paper in 1176, suggesting that his sight deteriorated over time.Dandolo's blindness appears to have been total. Geoffrey de Villehardouin, whom Dandolo accompanied on the Fourth Crusade, wrote that ""although his eyes appeared normal, he could not see a hand in front of his face, having lost his sight after a head wound"". This piece of primary evidence seems to support Madden's theory that Dandolo's blindness was cortical, since his eyes appeared to be unharmed.    Dandolo's son, Ranieri, served as vice-doge during Dandolo's absence and was later killed in the war against Genoa for the control of Crete. It is unclear if he had other children besides Ranieri as the existence of none can be confirmed by contemporary evidence.During his dogeship, Dandolo was married to a woman named Contessa Minotto, to whom he delegated authority over his commercial and private affairs along with his brother, Andrea, and assumed friend Filippo Falier of the San Tomà parish, before he departed on a political trip to Constantinople with his brother, Giovanni, in 1183. Contessa's identity is debated, and it is often thought that she may have been a member of the Minotto clan though the veracity of this claim is inconclusive.In the nineteenth-century, the Regia Marina (Italian Navy) launched an ironclad battleship named Enrico Dandolo. Enrico Dandolo and his role in the conquest of Constantinople were referenced by Lord Byron in his poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Oh, for one hour of blind old Dandolo! Th' octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.

"Giovanna Dandolo was a dogaressa of Venice by marriage to doge Pasquale Malipiero (reign 1457–1462).  She was born circa 1400 as the daughter of Antonio Dandolo and married to Pasquale Malipiero in 1414. [SEP] She had four children: Lorenzo, Antonio, Maddalena and Polo.  Her spouse was elected doge in 1457.  She was given an elaborate coronation and entry in to Venice as dogaressa in January 1458. As her predecessor before her, Giovanna Dandolo came to play a very public role as dogaressa, performing representational tasks and acting as the protector of trades and individual artists.  She supported the newly introduced art of book printing in Venice, the lace industry of Burano, and acted as a financier for many writers, artists and scientists. She was referred to as the 'Empress of Printing' and the 'Queen of Lace' due to her role as the benefactor of these trades.She gathered a circle of 'men of letters' and writers around her and acted as their patron. Palazzi in La Virtu in Giuocco records that she was ""a princess of splendid physical and mental gifts but possessed of no private fortune.... In 1469 Giovanni Spira dedicated to her the first book ever printed in Venice.""  Many of the early books printed in Venice are dedicated to her, in gratitude for her patronage. Four of the first books printed in Venice in 1469 were all dedicated to her patronage.  She also became a patron of the lace industry of Burano, which developed during this period. Reportedly, she gathered a circle of noblewomen and manufactured the lace herself as well.The only known surviving portrait of a 15th-century dogaressa is that of Giovanna Dandolo on the reverse of a medal designed by Pietro da Fano (c. 1460).  She was the only dogaressa depicted on a portrait medal prior to the 16th-century, as well as one of only three Italian women, with Isotta degli Atti and Gianfrancesco I Gonzaga's daughter Cecilia Gonzaga, to have portrait medals made of them prior to this period.

"Count Vincenzo Dandolo (1758–1819) was an Italian chemist and agriculturist. [SEP] He was born in Venice of good family, though not of the same house as the famous doges, and began his career as a physician.He was a prominent opponent of the oligarchical party in the revolution which took place on the approach of Napoleon; and he was one of the envoys sent to seek the protection of the French. When the request was refused, and Venice was placed under Austria, he removed to Milan, where he was made member of the great council. In 1799, on the invasion of the Russians and the overthrow of the Cisalpine republic, Dandolo retired to Paris, where, in the same year, he published his treatise Les Hommes nouveaux, d'opérer une régénération nouvelle. But he soon after returned to the neighborhood of Milan to devote himself to scientific agriculture.In 1805 Napoleon made him governor of Dalmatia, with the title of provéditeur général, in which position Dandolo distinguished himself by his efforts to remove the wretchedness and idleness of the people, and to improve the country by draining the pestilential marshes and introducing better methods of agriculture. When, in 1809, Dalmatia was re-annexed to the Illyrian provinces, Dandolo returned to Venice, having received as his reward from the French emperor the title of count and several other distinctions. He died in Varese on 13 December 1819.Dandolo published in Italian several treatises on agriculture, vine-cultivation, and the rearing of cattle and sheep; a work on silkworms, which was translated into French by Fontanelle; a work on the discoveries in chemistry which were made in the last quarter of the 18th century (published 1796); and translations of several of the best French works on chemistry.

"Zilia Dandolo (died 13 October 1566), was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Lorenzo Priuli (ruled 1556–1559).    She was the daughter of Marco Dandolo and related to the doges Andrea Dandolo and Arigo Dandolo. [SEP] She married Priuli in 1526 in what was considered as almost an unequal match, as she was considered more high born than he. Her daughter was painted by Titian in ""The Annunciation"" as Mary. Zilia hosted many parties in the famous Palazzo Priuli.     She was described as the leading female aristocrat and the most respected female noble in Venice, and the election of her spouse to doge is attributed to her.  When her spouse was elected doge in 1556, the council decided that Zilia should be crowned. This was somewhat remarkable, as no dogaressa had been crowned since Taddea Michiel in 1478. Her Grand Entry and coronation on 18 September 1557 set the pattern for future ceremonies of the same kind.    Zilia was given many honors from the state unknown to other dogaressas. As a widow in 1559, she was granted the title of princess, her own court and pension from the state: when she appeared in public as dowager dogaressa, she was accompanied by courtiers, and was entitled to wear state robes. This was not usually granted a dogaressa, who was by custom normally expected to enter a convent as a widow. Dogaressa Cecilia Contarini were given the same honors in 1578.    In the  Cerimoniali (1464- 1592), she is one of only three dogaressas depicted in state robes as widows: the other two being Cecilia Contarini and Loredana Marcello.  A new form of glass was named after her: La Zilia.    "

"Francesco Maria del Monte, full name Francesco Maria Bourbon del Monte Santa Maria, (5 July 1549 – 27 August 1627) was an Italian Cardinal, diplomat and connoisseur of the arts. [SEP] His fame today rests on his early patronage of the important Baroque master Caravaggio, and on his art collection (the del Monte collection) which provides provenance for many important works of the period.     Born in Venice of the aristocratic del Monte family of Tuscan origin (which provided several cardinals to the Church), he was the son of Marquis Ranieri Bourbon del Monte, first count of Monte Baroccio, and Minerva Pianosa. He began his ecclesiastical career as Abbot commendatario of Santa Croce a Monte Fabali. He then went to Rome when he was still quite young, and was appointed as auditor for Cardinal Alessandro Sforza, before being finally admitted into the court of Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici. He made his way up through the clerical ranks as Referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature of Justice and of Grace (1580), and later went to serve the grand-duke of Tuscany, the former Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici. He was created cardinal deacon in the consistory of 14 December 1588 under Pope Sixtus V, and received the deaconry of S. Maria in Domnica the following year. He took part in the two conclaves of 1590 (Papal Conclave of September 1590 and the Papal Conclave of Autumn 1590), the conclave of 1591 and the conclave of 1592. He subsequently took the titles of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, Santa Maria in Trastevere, and S. Lorenzo in Lucina. As a cardinal he proved an accomplished diplomat and administrator: he represented the interests of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, the former Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici, in Rome, and was firmly but discreetly pro-French in the ongoing struggle between the French and Spanish for influence over the papacy. He served as Prefect of the Tridentine Council (1606 to 1616) and as Bishop of Palestrina from 1615 to 1621. He participated in the Papal Conclave of 1621 and had ambitions of being elected Pope but his pro-French sympathies ensured his veto by the Spanish.Academics such as Posner, Frommel and Hibbard have drawn upon extant documents (principally the correspondence of Dirk van Ameyden) that suggest the strong likelihood that he was homosexual and this may have influenced his tastes in the art he commissioned (including those by Caravaggio), as well as damaging prospects of assuming the papacy. Van Ameyden mischievously painted a portrait of a man that seemed to display more than a paternal care for the boys in his charge. But Graham-Dixon argues that such accusations seem deliberately to have been cast by the pro-Spanish Ameyden against the pro-French Del Monte in order to discredit him, and bear little real scrutiny. Besides which, there is better evidence that Del Monte had courted women in his youth. In short, the most honest and impartial scholarly conclusion about Del Monte's sexuality is that just as we currently do not have grounds to prove his homosexuality, we likewise do not have grounds to absolutely exclude that possibility. He died in his Rome palace, the (Palazzo Madama, today the home of the Italian Senate) and was buried in the church of Sant'Urbano, Rome.     The epitaph on De Monte's tomb describes him as an ""excellent patron of the good arts"". Del Monte was a perceptive supporter of the arts and sciences - he was the first recorded owner of the Portland Vase, and his Palazzo Madama household was one of the most important intellectual salons in Rome. At his death his art collection contained more than six hundred paintings, and his support of the young Caravaggio has given provenance to several of that artist's early works. Together with his brother, he helped Galileo win a lectureship in mathematics in Pisa in 1589 and in Padua in 1592. In the wake of Galileo’s discovery of the 'Medicean Planets', he gave the Cardinal a copy of his Sidereus Nuncius (Sidereal message) and a telescope as gifts (in 1610). When Galileo went to Rome in 1611, Grand Duke Cosimo II recommended him to the Cardinal’s council so that he could be helped during his sojourn at the Vatican.Del Monte was a patron of German painter Adam Elsheimer and Andrea Sacchi.

"Giovanni Dolfin (or Delfino) (Venice, 22 April 1617 - Udine, 20 July 1699) was an Italian Catholic Cardinal and playwright. [SEP] The nephew of the other cardinal Giovanni Delfino (seniore), he was the first senator of the Venetian republic, then, after abandoning civil and religious life, after various ecclesiastical duties he was consecrated titular bishop of Tagaste on 30 November 1656 by Carlo Carafa della Spina, Bishop of Aversa. In 1656 Girolamo Gradenigo wanted him as coadjutor in the Patriarchate of Aquileia. He succeeded him, as patriarch, two years later. On the request of the Republic of Venice, on 8 March 1667 Pope Alexander VII appointed him cardinal of San Salvatore in Lauro and then of the Saints Vito, Modesto and Crescenzia. He was abbot commendatore of the abbey of Rosazzo from 1668 until his death. He participated in the conclave of 1667, that of 1669-1670, that of 1676, that of 1689 and finally that of 1691; indeed during the latter his name re-entered among those of the papabili but his election was blocked by the Spaniards who did not see favorably a Venetian on the papal throne.While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of Alvise Sagredo, Patriarch of Venice (1678).     ""Four tragedies he wrote, Cleopatra (1660), Lucrezia, Medoro and Creso, which, although not entirely exempt from the defects of the century, for the nobility of the style nonetheless and for the conduct may be the best glues from the previous age. But he never wanted them to be published. The Cleopatra was first printed in the Italian Theater of the March. Maffei. So all four came to light, but very bad and battered, in Utrecht in 1730, until a much more correct and magnificent edition was made by Comino in Padua in 1733 together with an apologetic speech of the cardinal himself in defense of his Tragedies. Six dialogues in verse of this most learned cardinal were then printed in which they appear to be very well versed in the modern philosophy of those times without completely abandoning the prejudices of the old. But their style is not 'noble and supported as in the tragedies"".He was also the author of poems, of reflections on Tacitus and Sallust, and of ten prose dialogues of scientific subject, of which only one - dedicated to astronomy - was published.He is buried in Venice in the church of San Michele di Murano.

Pietro Delfin was a patrician of Venice, member of the famous Delfin family, one of the oldest noble families in Venice. Pietro entered the Camaldolese Monastery of St. Michael, which was located on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon. In 1479, he was elected abbot of the same community. The following year he was made prior general of the Order, based at Camaldoli in the region of Arezzo. He held that office until the year 1513 when he resigned in favour of Paul Giustiniani, whom he had invested with the Camaldolese habit in 1510.  Delfin was the forty-sixth prior general from St. Romuald, the founder of the Camaldolese, and he was the last elected for life--the office after him being held for three years only. From 1481 to 1508, Delfin was proposed to serve as bishop of Venice on five occasions, but refused them all. On four occasions he was also proposed to serve as Patriarch of Aquilea, but refused again. He was also presented with the cardinalate in two occasions, but respectfully declined to the Pope to continue serving the camaldolese order. Delfin was one of the main opposers to Savonarola, but still promoted the reform inside the Catholic Church which would lead to the Council of Trento.   "
"Agata della Pietà (fl. ca. 1800) was an Italian composer, singer, and teacher of music. [SEP] A foundling admitted in infancy to the Ospedale della Pietà in Venice, she received thorough musical training from her childhood in the coro, or music school, of the convent; she later became a soprano soloist, singing teacher, and school administrator. She is known to have been the soloist in motets commissioned from Giovanni Porta and Andrea Bernasconi, in whose manuscripts she is mentioned by name; she is also mentioned in an anonymous verse tribute to musicians of the Pietà cori which dates to around 1740. She was probably born in about 1720, perhaps earlier, judging by the dates of sources that mention her. Only two motet settings by della Pietà, a Novo aprili in F (inscribed to one ""Louisa Della Sga Agnatta"") and a setting, also in F, of Psalm 134 for compline, survive; only the instrumental bass part to the latter survives. In addition, she produced a pedagogical text, Regali per Gregoria, for one of her pupils, an alto soloist named Gregoria known to have been active between 1746 and 1777. Along with Michielina and Santa della Pietà, della Pietà was one of three foundlings of the Ospedale known to have become a composer.  Nothing is known of her later years or of her death.   "

Babies would be dropped off through a secret opening barely large enough for them, first created in 1696. She was called Anna Maria, though later known as Anna Maria dal Violin and Anna Maria della Pietà. By the time she was eight her musical prowess had brought her to the attention of the heads of the school. She was taught the violin by the school music director Antonio Vivaldi.She in turn taught Chiara della Pietà and Santa della Pietà. Many of the concertos written by Antonio Vivaldi were written especially for her. Anna Maria remained at the orphanage her whole life. Her music brought tourists to hear the orchestra and her play.  An anonymous poet wrote that when she played countless angels dare to hover near. In 1720, at the age of 24, she was dubbed ""Maestra"", by 1737 Anna Maria had attained the leadership posts of maestra di violino and maestra di coro.

"Antonio Denzio (23 September 1689 – after 1763) was an Italian impresario, tenor, and librettist. [SEP] Born in Venice to a family of musicians and operatic personnel, he pursued a career mainly as a singer until 1724, when he traveled to Bohemia as a member of the opera company of Antonio Maria Peruzzi, probably his uncle. Peruzzi had the idea of bringing an Italian opera company to central Europe to perform first in Prague, then Dresden and Leipzig. The company was first brought to Bohemia under the patronage of Count Franz Anton von Sporck, who had it play at his palace at Kuks in northwest Bohemia in the summer of 1724. The performances were so successful that he permitted the company to perform free of charge in his palace in Prague. After disagreements with Peruzzi, Denzio was able to supplant him as impresario before the end of the year 1724 and continued productions in the Sporck palace until 1735. Peruzzi left with some of the Peruzzi-Denzio players to found the Breslau Opera. Denzio's opera theater at Sporck's palace was the first standing opera theater in the city. His productions were popular with the Bohemian nobility until about 1729, after which Denzio's finances deteriorated. Count Sporck provided no financial assistance to the company except the free use of his theater, and he allowed it to fail. The company went bankrupt and Denzio was forced to spend time in debtors' prison. During its heyday, Denzio was able to attract at least one of the principal singing stars in Italy to Prague each season. The most prominent of all was Margherita Gualandi, who was forced to come to Prague after being blackballed in Italy for bad behavior. Denzio sought the assistance of Antonio Vivaldi in engaging singers for his company, and the composer sent music. In the early 1730s, Vivaldi came himself to Prague. Some of the music for one of his operas composed for Prague, Argippo, has only recently been re-discovered. Isolated as he was from his operatic base of Venice, Denzio was forced to become a theatrical jack-of-all-trades. He sang himself in the company's productions and also served as its poet. He wrote several full-length librettos, the most significant of which was La pravità castigata (1730), the earliest opera based on the Don Juan tale to use the original setting and characters. After returning briefly to Venice in 1735, Denzio tried again to mount opera companies in northern Europe, including in Brussels and Augsburg. Unfortunately, all of these ventures failed. The last record of him comes from a newspaper announcement published in Moscow in 1763.   "

He soon developed an interest in architecture and was educated in that art by Giacomo or Jacopo Albertolli (grandson of Giocondo Albertolli, a noted architect. Antonio wrote a number of treatises on architecture, including a monograph on Giovanni Battista Novello; a Speech on Architecture read in 1805 at the Accademia Veneta dei Filareti; also a Dissertation about the imitation of the antique in architecture given to the same academy; and article in the Giornale di Padova about the work of Jacopo Querenghi, titled Sul bello di proporzione in architettura.

"Girolamo Donato, also spelled Donati, Donado or Donà (c. 1456 – 20 October 1511), was a Venetian diplomat and humanist. [SEP] He made important translations of ancient Greek philosophy and the Greek Fathers into Latin. He served the Republic of Venice on embassies abroad on twelve separate occasions, most importantly at Rome four times, and also served as a governor of Ravenna (1492), Brescia (1495–97), Cremona (1503–04) and Crete (1506–08).    Girolamo was the son of Antonio di Andrea and Lucia di Bernardo Balbi of the patrician class. His father belonged to the dalle Rose branch of the Donato family. His birth is usually given as around 1456 or before 1457. Giovanni degli Agostini places his birth in 1457, but also gives his age as 57 at his death. He is recorded as 18 years old when presented to the avogadori di Comun on 22 or 27 November 1474. He married Maria di Ludovico Gradenigo and passed his entire career in public service, for which reason he seems to have died poor.Donato learned Latin and Greek in childhood. His Greek tutor was Theodore Gaza. He studied philosophy and theology under Nicoletto Vernia at the University of Padua, receiving his degree of doctor of arts on 16 June 1478. He was studying law at Padua in 1489, when he held the office of rector jointly with Marco Dandolo. At Padua, Donato ""was generally held to be one of the most learned of the Peripatetics who flourished in the city"". His speech on the subject of the unmoved mover in the academic year 1480–81 inspired Elia del Medigo to compose his Quaestio de primo motore.    Donato's first public charge was as ambassador to the court of René II, Duke of Lorraine, in 1483. A string of ambassadorships followed: to the Republic of Genoa in 1484; to the Kingdom of Portugal in 1486;  to Maximilian I, elected Holy Roman Emperor, in 1488; to the Duchy of Milan in 1489–90; and to the Holy See in 1491–92.In 1492, Donato was elected podestà and captain of Ravenna. In 1494–95, he served as one of the avogadori di Comun (public prosecutors). Between 1495 and 1497, he was podestà and vice-captain of Brescia. There he hired the Albanian scholar Marino Becichemo as a tutor for his son Filippo. While still podestà of Brescia, he went on an embassy to the Republic of Lucca in 1496. During 1497–1499, he reprised his role as ambassador to the Holy See. Afterwards he was visdomino (Venetian representative) in the Duchy of Ferrara, but there is some disagreement concerning the dates of his visdominato: he appears to have been in Ferrara in July 1499, but other sources do not place him there until 1500 or even February 1501. In 1501, he returned as ambassador to the Emperor-elect Maximilian.Donato was one of the 41 electors in the election of the doge in 1501; Leonardo Loredan was elected. He served as ambassador to the Kingdom of France in 1501–02. In 1503–04, he was podestà of Cremona. In the latter year, he was elected to be one of the Savi del Consiglio (wise men of the council). He was selected for the embassy of congratulation to newly elected Pope Julius II that, for political reasons related to the downfall of Cesare Borgia, did not set out until March 1505. Later that year he joined the Ducal Council. In 1506, he was appointed Duke of Crete. He wrote a letter describing the Cretan earthquake of 1508. His office ended in 1508 and in 1509 he rejoined the Ducal council.In April 1509, Venice was placed under interdict by Julius II and targeted by the forces of the League of Cambrai. Donato led the embassy that negotiated the lifting of the excommunication in February 1510. He continued on as ambassador to the Holy See, and, when the League fell apart, negotiated the creation of the Holy League allying Venice with the Holy See, Spain and England on 5 October 1511. He was proclaimed a hero in Venice. Already ill at the time, he died in Rome two weeks later. The Great Council awarded pensions to his widow and his nine surviving sons. According to Agostini, a Frenchman hearing of his death remarked, ""He was a man of letters before he was a statesman; and he distinguished himself equally in both professions.""    Donato wrote in both Latin and Greek. Some of his works are lost. His original works include speeches, political tracts and poems. He wrote two theological treatises defending the primacy of the Holy See and the dual procession of the Holy Spirit against Greek Orthodoxy: Apologeticus ad Graecos de principatu Romanae sedis and De processione Spiritus Sancti contra Graecum schisma. The first was written in Greek while he was Duke of Crete and addressed to the Cretans. He translated it into Latin for Julius II and this version was published by his son.He made many translations from Greek to Latin. His first published work was a translation of Alexander of Aphrodisias, published at Brescia by Bernardino Misinta on 13 September 1495. This was the first translation of Alexander into Latin. It was reprinted at Venice in 1502. In 1496, Misinta published a translation John Chrysostom. He also translated John of Damascus and Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite. Seven letters by Donato have been published. He maintained a correspondence with Ermolao Barbaro, Pietro Bembo, Marco Dandolo, Pietro Dolfin, Marsilio Ficino, Domenico Grimani, Giovanni Lorenzi, Aldo Manuzio, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Angelo Poliziano and Marcantonio Sabellico.Numerous contemporaries praised his learning: Jacopo Boldù, Egnazio, Desiderius Erasmus, Giovanni Morosini and Francesco Pisani. Others dedicated works to him: Gasparino Borro's Commentum super tractatum spherae mundi, Aldo Manuzio's editions of Dioscorides and Nicander, Marcantonio Sabellico's De situ venetae urbis, Pierio Valeriano's Lusus. Donati, Bernardo Bembo and Ermolao Barbaro have been called the best representatives of late 15th-century Venetian humanism.   "

"Giovanni Battista Falcieri (known as “Tita”) (1798–1874) was the personal servant of Lord Byron and was present at his death in Missolonghi in 1824. [SEP] He later accompanied Benjamin Disraeli on his tour of the Orient, before becoming the valet of Isaac D'Israeli.    Tita was a gondolier and it was in that capacity that he first entered Lord Byron's service in 1818 during Byron's sojourn in Venice. He later became Byron's personal attendant and appears frequently in the correspondence of Byron's friends and acquaintances.    According to Count Gamba's account of Byron's death: At four o’clock, after this consultation of his physicians, he seemed to be aware of his approaching end. I think this was the exact time, and not before. Dr. Millingen, Fletcher, and Tita were round his bed. The two first could not contain their tears, and walked out of the room. Tita also wept, but he could not retire, as Byron had hold of his hand; but he turned away his face. Byron looked at him steadily, and said, half smiling, in Italian—Oh questa è una bella scena. Falcieri accompanied Lord Byron's body to England.    Following Byron's funeral Tita remained in England and served as valet to Byron's friend John Cam Hobhouse, before returning to Greece to fight in the Greek War of Independence in 1825. In 1828 he returned to England and served as valet to James Clay on his Grand Tour 1829/30. Falcieri subsequently joined Benjamin Disraeli on his tour of the Orient in 1830/31 and was then employed as valet to Isaac D’Israeli at Bradenham Manor in Buckinghamshire between 1832 and 1848. On Isaac D’Israeli's death, Hobhouse arranged for him to be employed as a Government messenger. He numbered among his acquaintance the Count D’Orsay, who presented him with a valuable emerald ring in gratitude for his assistance in relation to a posthumous portrait of Byron.    After Falcieri's death, Disraeli recommended Tita's widow to Queen Victoria for a pension from the Civil list, though she did not enjoy it for long, dying in 1877. A portrait of Falcieri by Daniel Maclise forms part of the National Trust’s collection at Hughenden Manor.   "
"Zanetta Farussi, known as ""La Buranella"" (27 August 1707, Venice – 29 November 1776, Dresden), was an Italian comedic actress. [SEP] Her eldest son was the famous adventurer Giacomo Casanova.    Born Maria Giovanna Farussi, her father, Girolamo, was a shoemaker. In 1724, at the age of seventeen, she married the actor, Gaetano Casanova, ten years her senior, who had just returned to Venice after several years with a touring theatrical troupe to take a position at the Teatro San Samuele. The marriage was strongly opposed by her parents, because they considered acting to be a disreputable activity. Her father Girolamo died shortly after, from grief according to his grandson Giacomo, and her mother, Marcia, was reconciled only when Gaetano promised that he would not allow Zanetta to become an actress.This promise was soon broken when she began an apprenticeship at Gaetano's theater. While she was there, Giacomo was born and (according to Giacomo's memoirs) Gaetano suspected that Michele Grimani (1697–1775), the theater's proprietor, was actually the father. The following year, they accepted a theatrical engagement in London. It was there they had their second son, Francesco, who became a well-known painter. It was rumored that his father was actually the Prince of Wales (who shortly after became King George II); whether for scurrilous motives or publicity is unclear.  They returned to Venice in 1728 and eventually had four more children; Giovanni, who also became a painter, Faustina Maddalena (1731–1736), Maria Maddalena (1732–1800) and Gaetano Alvise (1734–1783), who became a priest; born two months after his father died of an infected abscess in his ear. The Grimani family, possibly remembering the suspicions surrounding Giacomo's birth, promised to look after Zanetta and her children.  In 1734, she met Carlo Goldoni in Verona and he wrote a short comedy for her, called La Pupilla (The Female Ward); inspired by the jealous infatuation she had aroused in Giuseppe Imer (1700–1758), a famous actor and major theatrical impresario. It was presented as an interlude with his tragicomedy, Belisario. The following year, she accepted an engagement in Saint Petersburg, but it was unsuccessful as few people in Russia knew Italian at that time. In 1737, she signed a long-term contract with the Electorate of Saxony to appear in Italian comedies. She débuted in Pilnitz in 1738, on the occasion of the proxy wedding of Crown Princess Maria Amalia. In 1748, she visited Warsaw, where she presented two short theatrical pieces she had written herself. In 1756, following the start of the Seven Years' War, the Saxon Court suspended the activities of her Italian comedy troupe. Everyone retired and received an annual pension of 400 Thalers.  During the war, she sought refuge in Prague. As soon as it was safe, she returned to Dresden and remained there for the rest of her life. Later, she was joined by her son Giovanni, who taught at the Academy of Fine Arts, and her daughter, Maria Maddelena, who married the Court Organist, Peter August (1726–1787).   "
"Giovanni Faustini (1615 – 19 December 1651) was an Italian librettist and opera impresario of the 17th century. [SEP] He is best remembered for his collaborations with the composer Francesco Cavalli.    Faustini was born in Venice.  Impresario at the Teatro San Cassiano, Teatro San Moisè and Teatro Sant 'Apollinare, his 14 libretti were mostly set by Cavalli, with a few being used by other composers. The libretti Faustini left incomplete at his death were later finished by his brother Marco Faustini, who continued his brother's career as impresario at multiple theatres. Three of his librettos are based on mythological themes, but these are exceptions rather than the rule. A typical Faustini plot relies not on myth or classical history but upon his own imagination. He based his creative thinking upon a fundamental pattern of two pair of aristocratic lovers from exotic nations, who undergo a lengthy process of separation and reconciliation, assisted by a good number of clownish servants who provide comic relief. Many devices from Roman comedy and the pastoral genre also appear, such as sleeping potions and letters delivered to the wrong person. Faustini was heavily committed to his career as a professional librettist, and his work with Cavalli was of vital importance in the development of Venetian opera.

"Marco Faustini (17 May 1606 - 7 January 1676) was an Italian theatrical impresario and brother of the impresario and librettist Giovanni Faustini. [SEP]    Marco Faustini was born in Venice. He began his career as an entrepreneur in the summer of 1651, working at the Teatro Sant 'Apollinare in Venice. After his brother's death on 19 December 1651, Faustini took over management of the theater until 1657. He went on to manage other theaters including the Teatro San Cassiano from 1657 to 1660, and the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo from 1660 to 1668 (probably with a break from 1663 to 1665). Marco Faustini, like his brother, collaborated with leading composers of his time including Francesco Cavalli, Pietro Andrea Ziani and Antonio Cesti, and hired famous singers such as Anna Renzi, Antonia Coresi and Vincenza Giulia Masotti. During his years as an impresario, he staged numerous plays of famous librettists of the time including Aurelio Aureli, Francis Small, Nicolò Minato, Nicholas Beregan, Pietro Angelo Zaguri and Cristoforo Ivanovich. Faustini's brother's last works remained unfinished, which he completed. Faustini's papers are stored at the Scuola Grande di San Marco, which represent a major source of information on the theatre work of the Venetian era.   "
"Cassandra Fedele (c. 1465 – 1558) was the most renowned woman scholar in Italy during the last decades of the Quattrocento. [SEP]    Fedele was born in Venice in 1465 to Barbara Leoni and Angelo Fedele. While Fedele does not mention her mother in her writings, we have evidence that her father was respected among the aristocracy and took a great interest in his daughter's learning. When Fedele reached fluency in Greek and Latin at the age of twelve, she was sent by her father to Gasparino Borro, a Servite monk, who tutored her in classical literature, philosophy, the sciences, and dialectics. In 1487, at twenty-two years of age, she achieved success in Italy and abroad when she delivered a Latin speech in praise of the arts and sciences at her cousin's graduation at Padua. Her speech, Oratio pro Bertucio Lamberto, was published in Modena (1487), Venice (1488), and Nuremberg (1489). From 1487 to 1497, she exchanged letters with prominent humanists and nobles throughout Spain and Italy. One of these correspondents, Isabella I of Castile, urged Fedele to join her court in Spain. Fedele declined the invitation, writing that she could not go while Italy was at war with France. However, Fedele's early biographers believed that the doge Agostino Barbarigo would not allow Fedele to leave Italy, although there is no evidence of such a decree.    Fedele achieved fame through her writing and oratorical abilities. In addition to the 123 letters and 3 orations published in Padua in 1636, it is believed that she also wrote Latin poetry. She participated with influential humanists in public debates on philosophical and theological issues and was asked to speak in front of the doge Agostino Barbarigo and the Venetian Senate on the subject of higher education for women. In a letter to Lorenzo de' Medici, Angelo Poliziano praised her for her excellence in both Latin and Italian and for her beauty.    Fedele's success was short lived. The climax of her scholarly activity occurred between the ages of twenty-two and thirty-three, just prior to her marriage at age thirty-four (1499). After she married, and for almost sixty years, she wrote few letters and was invited only once, in 1556, to deliver a public address in honor of the Queen of Poland, Bona Sforza, who came to Venice. Some historians argue that Fedele abandoned her intellectual pursuits when she got married, as was the case for most learned women of her day who married and assumed full-time management of an entire household. Fedele may have also been discouraged by strong social forces that opposed the scholarly participation of married women. In a letter to Alessandra Scala, who wrote Fedele asking whether she should get married or devote her life to study, Fedele encouraged her to ""choose the path for which nature has suited you"" (translation in Robin 31). In 1520, on Fedele's return from Crete with her physician husband, Giammaria Mapelli, she lost all her belongings in a shipwreck. Her husband died later that year, leaving her a widow, childless, and in financial difficulty. Fedele wrote to Leone X asking for help in 1521, but he did not reply to her letter. She tried again in 1547 and wrote to Paolo III, who responded by giving her a position as the prioress of an orphanage at the church of San Domenico di Castello in Venice where she resided until her death. Fedele may have also struggled with health problems. Before her marriage she complained of an illness that was depleting her strength and making it difficult to concentrate on reading and writing for any length of time.   "

Nothing is known of his childhood and his musical formation in Italy, but it is known that he soon made a name for himself, since Dirck Strijcker, the son of the Dutch consul in Venice had him come to Amsterdam, where an opera was founded.  In 1681 the booklet of Helena rapita da Paride appeared, composed by Domenico Freschi, and for which Fiocco arranged the music. The same year he composed a prologue for Alceste by Pietro Andrea Ziani sung in Hanover in 1682, and for the Lully operas Amadis, Acis et Galathée, Armide and Thésée. In the summer of 1682, he went to Brussels to enter the service of Eugen Alexander Franz, Count of Thurn and Taxis. He married Jeanne de Latere. Named choirmaster of the church Notre-Dame des Victoires, Fiocco composed religious works, including masses and motets. He died in Brussels in 1714.    He was the father of Melissa Amelia Fiocco. She died at the young age of 23, while traveling to visit her close friend Erica Grier in North Italy, leaving her husband, Angelo Pertioniro and three children, Sabrina Pertioniro, Gabriella Pertioniro and Claudio Pertioniro.

"Fulgenzio Manfredi (Venice, c. 1560 – Rome, 5 July 1610), or Fra Fulgenzio, was a Franciscan friar, an observant minor, and active preacher in Venice from 1594. [SEP] During the Venetian Interdict imposed by Pope Paul V, he gained particular prominence for his anti-Roman sermons, preaching against papal regulation of religious orders in the Venetian republic.   He was a colleague of the famous theologian and scholar, Father Paolo Sarpi in the defence of the Venetian Republic in her struggle with the Curia. Manfredi was tried by the Roman Inquisition, declared a relapsed heretic, and sentenced to be burnt. He was executed in the Campo di Fiore, in Rome.    Fulgentio Manfredi was probably born in Venice circa 1563, the son of Ludovico Manfredi.  We know of two brothers; Giambattista, painter and engraver, and Gabriele, sensale di cambi. He joined religious life as an acolyte in 1580 and became a priest in 1586. He studied theology, and joined the Capuchin Franciscans, the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. From as early as 1594 he was preaching in churches in Venice and outside, as well as in San Francesco della Vigna, where he was assigned.  Known for his eloquent but biting polemic, he was banned from preaching for four years in 1594.    Manfredi alternated oratory activity with the production of religious and historical writings. However his authorship of certain works is quite speculative. In 1598 a compendium on the lives of the doges appeared, that consisted of twelve tablets engraved in copper with the portraits of ninety doges, with brief biographical notes. The carving was by his brother, Giambattista, and Antonio Foscarini ascribes the biographical notes to Manfredi.     The Procuratorial Dignity of St. Mark of Venetia (Venice, 1602).; a small work on a ""matter not previously treated,"" according to Manfredi, which had a certain resonance among writers of his time. The Lives of Saints and Blessed Venetians (never published) Essay on the very modest lives of St Magno, contained in a sermon given in the Church of the Saints Apostles, where he preached from 1604 until 6 October 1605 Life of St Peter of Orseolo, Doge and Prince of Venice, who became a Hermit Monk in Gascony (Venice, 1606)Manfredi's fame however rests less in his literary productions, and more in his public oratory.    During the Venetian Interdict, his participation in the anti-Roman campaign from the ranks of the so-called ""minor theologians"" alongside the official ones, brought him to prominence. The fact that he was not ""a public or salaried minister"" was popular. From the pulpits of Il Redentore and the Church of Humility, which had been confiscated from the Jesuits and entrusted to Manfredi, in front of a large audience among whom were many senators, Manfredi excoriated  ""the customs of the Roman court"" By 1605, the Roman Congregation of the Index, had condemned a document protesting reforms imposed on his Order, attributed to him. At the end of 1606, he was summoned by the Congregation of the Holy Office ""ad respondendum de fide"" (to answer for the faith), but did not attend. In a ""Manifesto""  written to the Roman Inquisition which had summoned him to appear (Venice 1606) he addresses ""All the Most Reverend Fathers in Christ, the gratitude of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, and the zeal of the Apostles,"" and professes himself, ""an openly veritable preacher, a staunch defender of the Evangelical doctrine and most humble follower of the Apostolic life"" The excommunication issued on 5 January 1607 brought him growing notoriety, popularity, and accusations of heresy.  The republican Paolo Sarpi, wrote to the German exponent of Protestant Union, Christoph von Dohna, maintaining that Manfredi's sermons were ""only against the Pope"" and they ""criticised the ecclesiastical defects very effectively"". Even the conservative statesman, Girolamo Cappello, denied that Manfredi had affirmed ""heretical things""The general tendency was to dismiss him as a mere friar who made distasteful pronouncements against Catholic customs. Berlinghiero Gessi, the papal nuncio to Venice (Sept 1607 – July 1610) wrote to Cardinal Scipione Borghese shortly on his arrival, admitting that, although Manfredi had said many things from the pulpit, that should a case be taken against him ""they could prove little"" for lack of witnesses: and that ""sadly he cannot be condemned, and he himself will only confess to having dissuaded the observance of the Interdict, and all the rest it is claimed he opposes, he denies"". Nevertheless, Manfredi's exuberance concerned all the parties to the dispute. The Republic of Venice was careful to distinguish 'firm defense of the jurisdictional princes', from 'attacks on the pontiff's own person'. On 21 April 1607 following Cardinal François de Joyeuse's intervention in the Interdict dispute, Manfredi was withdrawn from governance of the Church of Humility and his activities limited. Nuncio Gessi, angrily protested the provocative megalomaniac posting of a festoon on the door of the Church of the Humility showing the symbol of the Holy See in a ""vacant"" configuration, and a separate act of displaying a portrait, with the caption  ""Evangelicae veritatis propugnator acerrimus"" (Ardent Defender of Gospel Truth).    Meanwhile, Manfredi, who was feeling increasingly isolated and betrayed by the republic he had passionately defended, became gradually more receptive to a plan to return him to obedience to the Church, devised by nuncio Gessi. Gessi rejected the Curia’s proposed use of force and instead managed to exploit Manfredi's ambitiousness and vanity to cajole him. Aided by Zevio the Veronese, a friend of Manfredi and brother friar, and a promise of safe conduct and absolution from excommunication, Gessi persuaded Manfredi to 'take refuge' in Rome.  Some attempted to dissuade and warn him about the patrician sarpiano Nicolò Contarini, whom the government had tasked with preventing Manfredi from carrying out anti-Venetian activity once in Rome. On 8 August 1608, with a guarantee of safe conduct, Manfredi fled to Rimini, and from there to Ferrara and Bologna, where, ""jubilant and happy"", he was received with full honors  – wrote Zevio the Borghese. In a letter to the Venetian Senate, Manfredi claimed that presenting himself to Pope Paul V lifted the burden from them of his defense, and he assured the senators that he had acted out of ""love not mercy"".  Nevertheless, one fellow friar confided that he had been ""more coddled and favored in the past few days than in all the years of valuable service to our 'Vinetians'."" One prelate, witness to his departure, commented wryly: ""Poor friar, with what joy and safety he goes to Rome, not knowing that he goes to the slaughterhouse.""  The chronicler G.C. Sivos noted contemptuously: ""Everyone ran to see him and the fool believed they competed for his virtues and beautiful deeds, not knowing himself for a wicked man...[not looking for] absolution from the excommunication, but boasting...that he was honored and cheered everywhere he passed, and feted by all the people with great competition, without seeing that many had come to witness an evildoer led to the scaffold.""Paolo Foscarini suggested that Manfredi had gone ""with many doubts"" and the Venetian ambassador in Rome, Francesco Contarini, wrote on 23 August that he had been promised 200 scudi a year, a secret abjuration and ample opportunity to preach.Manfredi arrived in Rome on 30 August and went to San Pietro in Montorio, the residence of his Order and two days later had an audience with the Pope, who ""welcomed him with great promptness and with great humanness"" and confirmed the promises that had been given.  Manfredi, initially keen to provide detailed information on Protestant penetration in Venice, was soon uneasy.  He found himself relieved from office, prevented from preaching, disappointed with his commission, opposed by the confreres and viewed with increasing suspicion by the authorities, and petitioned Venice in early 1610 for his return. This was ignored. Meanwhile, throughout 1609, the Roman Inquisition continued preparations to bring serious charges against him.    ""Yesterday morning"" – wrote the new Venetian ambassador, Giovanni Mocenigo, on 6 February 1610 – ""around twenty orders went to his Church of Aracoeli, and there took Fra Fulgentio prisoner. They wanted him to talk about the person of the Pope and others, for which they are not too well received."" Mocenigo wrote, on 13 February, he had been unable to ascertain anything more except that Manfredi had ""caused a scandal with his customs,"" and that writings had been confiscated indicating his intention to escape to England. Manfredi, who was in the Tor di Nona prison, was dejected and humble, ""against his custom"". He was transferred to the prisons of the Inquisition Congregation, and tried. The charges included possession of forbidden books, contacts with heretics and autographed attacks on Catholic doctrine, the de-legitimisation of the Pope and the Council of Trent, and accusations of heresy. Manfredi denied all charges and claimed they were the result of misunderstanding. He was found guilty, declared a ""relapso"" (relapsed heretic), and handed over to the secular arm.    Different accounts of the execution are recorded; the official version given in ambassador Mocenigo's dispatches to the Senate of 3 & 10 July 1610, relates that:  On Sunday afternoon, in the Church of St. Peter, Fra Fulgentio abjured. There was present an infinite number of people. The Superiors of all the Orders were summoned to attend. I have learned from those who heard the minutes of the trial read out, that in documents in his own handwriting found in his cell he endeavoured to diminish and abolish Pontifical authority.Fra Fulgentio was not aware that he was to make this abjuration till two hours before they took him into St. Peter's; he believed that he was to be absolved upon some salutary penance or something of little more importance; accordingly when, in the reading of the trial he heard himself styled ""relapsed"" and when the sentence of the Holy Office was published by which he was to be degraded and handed to the secular arm, he changed entirely and swooned away from the excessive fear which fell upon him. He was taken from St. Peter's to his degradation; and although it is customary to grant to those about to die for such crimes one or two days' grace, and the execution of the sentence was actually announced for Tuesday, nevertheless on Monday morning, very early, in the Campo di Fiore, he was hung by the neck from a stake, at which he was afterwards burned. At his death he showed great compunction of penitence, declaring aloud that he desired to die in the bosom of the Holy Roman Apostolic Church, repeating the word ""Roman"" several times, to the mighty edification of the bystanders. The tragedy that has befallen this unhappy man has given occasion to much discussion as to past events, and also because from this quarter he was enticed to leave Venice and was even assured of the protection and favour of His Holiness; and all the more so that, without that first abjuration which he was forced to make secretly on his arrival and merely as a form which would not deprive him of any rights, it would have been impossible to declare him ""relapsed"" and consequently they could not have put him to death. All the same those who heard the trial declare that he justly forfeited the protection of His Holiness and that it was impossible for them not to execute sentence on his person, for he affirmed positively that St. Peter was not the head of the Apostles, that the Pope was not St. Peter's successor, that he had no authority to create Bishops, that the Council of Trent was not general, that the Pope was a heretic, that friars and priests might marry, that it was not obligatory to consecrate the Sacrament in the Roman fashion; moreover he was in understanding with a heretic Prince in Germany and was minded to retire there in order to write and to live freely; that he had written letters to the King of England and had received in his cell a heretic English pilgrim, to whom he had said that he would like to go to England and by whom he was assured that the King would make much of him; and other such things.

"Giovanni Antonio Fumiani (1645–1710) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. [SEP] Born in Venice in 1645, he trained in Bologna under Domenico degli Ambrogi, a specialist in quadratura, but by 1668 he was back in Venice, where he painted a Virgin and Saints in San Benedetto. He was influenced by Ludovico Carracci and Alessandro Tiarini, and soon also became interested in the work of Paolo Veronese, so that he started to use elaborate architectural settings and brighter colours. He painted a Virgin Appearing to Pius V (1674; Vicenza, S Lorenzo), whose monumentality foreshadows Tiepolo, whereas mosaics in San Marco, created in 1677 from Fumiani’s cartoons, are closer to the idiosyncratic art of Pietro della Vecchia. He contributed to the decoration of San Rocco (1675, 1676, 1678), where he painted a large canvas of the Charity of St Roch on the ceiling of the nave, In his smaller paintings, however, such as the modelli (Florence, Uffizi) painted for the patron  Ferdinand de Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, for whom he worked for a long time, with Niccolò Cassana acting as intermediary, Fumiani revealed a lively decorative sense and a taste for animated, sensual subjects that produced works of great quality.  Between 1684 and 1704, Fumiani decorated the ceiling of San Pantalon in Venice (Chiesa di San Pantaleone Martire) with what has been claimed to be the largest painting on canvas in the world. The painting depicts The Martyrdom and Apotheosis of San Pantalon across 44 canvases that cover the large ceiling (25x50 m). This was an ambitious undertaking, both in its scale and in the unity of the magniloquent images, that parallels Andrea Pozzo’s decoration at the church of Sant'Ignazio in Rome.  Fumiani putatively died from a fall from a San Pantalon ceiling scaffold, although some sources date his death to six years after he stopped work on the San Pantalon ceiling. One of his last works was the 1705 large lunette depicting Otto III (or Frederick III) Visiting the Convent of San Zaccaria in the Company of the Doge (Venice, San Zaccaria).   "

In 1749 he entered the clergy and began his wide studies, ranging from theology to philosophy, from history to ancient literature, especially to the eastern languages, especially Hebrew (his master was the rabbi Simchah ben Abraham Calimani), the Syriac and the Chaldean. He also gained knowledge of English and French as well as of mathematics and geometry.For a time he was employed as a private teacher, but in December 1782 he was called to take the Greek and Hebrew chair in Venice. There is no documentary evidence that, as claimed by some biographers, Gallicciolli rejected the chair of Oriental languages at the University of Parma. Certainly he rejected the proposal of Andrea Querini who wanted him at the University of Padua. He accepted, however, to teach Greek for free to the masters of the Patriarchal Seminary of Venice.Until the end of his existence, he was divided between his activities of scholar and philologist and priest in San Cassiano, his native parish.From the very beginning, Galliccioli distinguished himself, in Venice and outside, as a great connoisseur of Jewish language and culture. Between 1774 and 1805 he was in close contact with Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi, with whom he had an epistle of philological questions. He was also a friend of Jacopo Nani and Andrea Memmo, for whom he studied ancient inscriptions and codes.The first important publication that emphasized his relevance, especially in the patristic era, was S.

She escaped a second marriage after becoming a professed religious despite her father's fierce resistance.Her beatification received ratification from Pope Pius VIII on 4 March 1830 after her local 'cultus' received confirmation.    Vittoria Gambacorti was born in the Republic of Venice in 1362 to Pietro Gambacorti, a rich merchant who was sent into political exile that year. In 1369 political circumstances of Pisan politics saw them relocate to Pisa where her father was appointed as chief magistrate.Gambacorti was a pious child who seemed to be destined for an arranged marriage that would bring with it numerous political advantages not for her benefit but rather for the benefit of her father and brothers. She accepted this as the will of her father and was married to Simone Massa in 1374. Sometime after this her father met with Catherine of Siena to discuss politics and Catherine met with Gambacorti and offered her both advice and encouragement on being a good wife and above all a dedicated Christian. Her time as a wife was cut short when her husband died of the plague in 1377 and despite her happiness as a wife she was more than reluctant to enter marriage again, though aware that her father was negotiating another marriage for her. Not long after the death of her husband she received a letter from Catherine who exhorted her to follow her faith.The frightened girl fled her home and sought refuge with the Poor Clares at their convent of Santa Croce, taking ""Chiara"" as her religious name . Her brother found her and removed her from the convent so that the arranged marriage could go ahead. Her father locked her in a dark room and kept her isolated from her friends, and from church life. But with the aid of her mother she managed to smuggle jewels out from her room to friends so the proceeds of the jewels could be used for the poor, while her mother smuggled her out to Mass on one occasion  when her father and brothers were not at home. Her father asked a visiting Spanish bishop – a former confessor to Bridget of Sweden – to persuade her to accept his views. But the bishop went against this and encouraged Gambacorti to pursue her call to the religious life, giving her father no other choice but to allow her to leave  home. She had spent from 29 June 1376 to 30 November as her father's captive.Gambacorti did not return to the Poor Clares but entered the Order of Preachers, inspired by Catherine's example; she made her profession in December 1378. The convent she joined was weak in its observance to the rule of Dominic of Osma so she – who favored a strict and rigorous implementation – arranged with her new stepmother for a new convent to be built. At the beginning of 1377 her father welcomed Pope Gregory XI in Livorno, when the pontiff was moving back from Avignon to Rome, and her father began work on a new church to celebrate the pontiff's return. The church of San Domenico was constructed in 1385 – at her father's orders – adjacent to her convent and she moved into the new convent completed on 29 August 1382. Gambacorti knew Marie Mancini around this time.On 21 October 1392 thugs murdered Giovanni Lanfranchi and his son and sought refuge at the home of Jacopo d'Appiano who was plotting an insurrection against Gambacorti's father. Then her father was chased by this mob and killed with several blows of a sword and dagger in the street outside her convent. Two of his sons (Lorenzo and Benedetto) were attacked in the fight as well. Benedetto died in the skirmish but Lorenzo was wounded and rushed to the convent, pleading with his sister for refuge. She refused him due to her earlier familial memories and allowed him to die in the streets.After it seemed that she would die she asked for food to be sent to her from the home of her father's murderer and the man's wife obliged, after which the man was killed. The widow and her daughters were then allowed to reside in the convent.Gambacorti died in Pisa on 17 April 1420 and a legend stated that when one of the sisters at her convent was at the verge of death her bones would rattle in her coffin.    Her beatification received confirmation on 4 March 1830 from Pope Pius VIII after he confirmed the late nun's longstanding local 'cultus' (or popular devotion).   "

About 1566 he joined a congregation near to the Jesuits’ College in Brescia and entered the Society of Jesus in 1567 or 1568. In 1568 he lectured in logic in Parma and in 1573 he was a third–year student in theology in Padua. On 9 June 1579 he took his four vows in Brescia and from 1579 he lived, as a confessor, in Venice.

"Serafino Gentili (1775 – 13 May 1835) was an Italian opera singer particularly known for his performances in tenore di grazia roles. [SEP] He sang in opera houses throughout Italy as well as in Paris and Dresden. During the course of his career, he created the role of Lindoro in Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri as well as leading roles in several other operas by less well-known composers. In his later years, he went by the surname Gentili-Donati to distinguish himself from the tenor Pietro Gentili. Gentili was born in Venice and is presumed to have had his training there although little is known about his early life. However, by 1795 he was listed as ""virtuoso di musica"" in Ascoli Piceno where he made his debut at the Teatro Ventidio Basso in 1796 as Folletto in Antonio Brunetti's Lo sposo di tre e marito di nessuna.From 1822 to 1824 Gentili sang at the court opera in Dresden, primarily in Rossinian roles. On his return to Italy, his appearances became less frequent. His last known performance was in April 1825 at La Scala where he reprised the role of Lindoro in L'italiana in Algeri.

"Gerard or Gerard Sagredo (Hungarian: Gellért; Italian: Gerardo di Sagredo; Latin: Gerardus; 23 April 977/1000 – 29 August 1046) was the first bishop of Csanád in the Kingdom of Hungary from around 1030 to his death. [SEP] Most information about his life was preserved in his legends which contain most conventional elements of medieval biographies of saints. He was born in a Venetian noble family, associated with the Sagredos or Morosinis in sources written centuries later. After a serious illness, he was sent to the Benedictine San Giorgio Monastery at the age of five. He received excellent monastic education and also learnt grammar, music, philosophy and law. He left Venice for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land around 1020, but a storm compelled him to break his journey near Istria. He decided to visit the Kingdom of Hungary. Maurus, bishop of Pécs, and Stephen I of Hungary convinced him not to continue his pilgrimage, emphasizing that Gerard's preachings could accelerate the conversion of the Hungarians. Gerard was made the tutor of the king's son and heir, Emeric. Before long, Gerard went to the Bakony Hills to live as a hermit near Bakonybél. Stephen I made him bishop of the newly established Diocese of Csanád (encompassing present-day Banat in Serbia, Romania and Hungary) around 1030. Benedictine monks who could speak Hungarian helped him to preach among the local inhabitants.   "

Graduated in utroque jure at the University of Padua, he seemed to want to embrace the ecclesiastical state, but was instead initiated into a political and diplomatic career; after having exercised some minor offices in Venice, in 1577 he was appointed podestà and captain of Belluno. Between 1582 and 1595 he was sent as ambassador of the Republic of Venice to Poland, Spain, Germany and France, whence he returned eight years later to go to the role of ambassador to the Holy See, a post he held until 1598. In the same year he officially represented Venice at the wedding of Philip III of Spain and in 1601 to those of Henry IV of France and Maria de' Medici. Returning to his homeland he took the post of San Marco's attorney and the reformer of Studio Padovano.

Gradenigo devoted to politics very early in his life, acting as podestà of Ragusa and Capodistria, as well as procuratore in the capital. He also became soon renowned for his excessive love for luxury. He married three times and had six children. One of his spouses was Giustina Capello.His short reign was rather peaceful, apart from a revolt in Crete and some Turkish incursions. It was also characterized by some diplomatic moves towards Genoa. The most important event was the tempest that struck against Venice on 15 February 1340 and which, according to legend, was pushed back only through the supernatural intercession of St. Mark, St. George and St. Nicholas, brought to the lagoon by a humble fisherman. After the storm had disappeared, the three saints gave the fisherman a ring, called ""Ring of the Fisherman"", which he gave to the doges and has since then been part of the ducal jewelry.

His recognized loyalty to the Venetian Republic probably helped him in being elected, as he came after the conjure which had led to the execution of his predecessor, Marin Falier. Two months after his election, the Venetians signed a peace with Genoa, ending a long and unfavorable war. During his reign measures were taken to improve the Republic's economic situation, but in 1356 they were again in war both on the mainland and in Dalmatia (which would end in the unfavorable Treaty of Zadar under his successor, Giovanni Dolfin).

"Antonio Grimani (28 December 1434 – 7 May 1523) was the Doge of Venice from 1521 to 1523. [SEP]    He was born in Venice into a relatively poor family and in his early years he worked as a tradesman, soon becoming one of the most important ones in the city. In 1494 he was created capitano generale da mar (sea commander-in-chief), a relatively easy task as he had to lead the Venetian operations along the Adriatic coast in a peaceful period. But when in 1499 a new war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire broke out, his lack of experience led to two crushing defeats (Sapienza, 19 August, and Zonchio, six days later). Grimani was threatened with the death penalty, but this was turned into a mild exile on the island of Cherso. Soon, however, he fled taking refuge in Rome in 1509. Thanks to the intercession of his sons, he could return in Venice in 1509. His political ties soon gained him important administrative charges and created the basis for his future election as doge (6 July 1521). Aged by the time he assumed the throne, he led the Republic into the Italian War of 1521, the only ally of Francis I of France that did not abandon him. Following the French defeat at the Battle of Bicocca, however, he grew concerned about the course of the war; but he died in 1523, and it was left to his successor, Andrea Gritti, to achieve a settlement with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. He was married to Caterina Loredan. The doge's son, Domenico Grimani, became a cardinal in 1493.   "
"Domenico Grimani (19 February 1461 – 27 August 1523) was an Italian nobleman, theologian  and cardinal. [SEP] Like most noble churchman of his era Grimani was an ecclesiastical pluralist, holding numerous posts and benefices. Desiderius Erasmus dedicated to Grimani his Musica.    Born in Venice, he was the eldest of five sons of Antonio Grimani, the oldest elected Doge of Venice, and his wife Catarina Loredan. Antonio was elected doge in 1521, when Domenico was already a cardinal.He exhibited an early predilection for humanist studies, which was encouraged by  teachers in his native Venice and then in the ambit of the Medicean academy in Florence, where he moved in the circle of Lorenzo de' Medici among scholars like Pico della Mirandola and Poliziano. He obtained a doctorate in canon law at the University of Padua on 23 October 1487 and was elected a Senator of Venice that same year.He became a cardinal in 1493, an appointment paid by his father with a sum of around 25,000/30,000 ducats.  Grimani was not ordained a priest until 1498.  After the election of Pope Julius II he became cardinal priest of San Marco.After a period as apostolic administrator in Nicosia, starting from 1498 he was Patriarch of Aquileia, a position he abandoned in favor of his nephew Marino (later also cardinal) in 1517. In 1508 he was named cardinal bishop of Albano, and was  also administrator of the diocese of Urbino (from 1514) and  bishop of Ceneda (1517-1520).  Grimani was already ill in the 1521 conclave, and died one year and a half later; he was buried in the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome, but later his remains were moved to San Francesco della Vigna.    Grimani was a large collector, owning works by artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Giorgione, Titian, Hans Memling, Hieronymus Bosch, Raphael and others: his collection now forms part of the Museo d'Antichità in the Doge's Palace in Venice, while several of his codexes are in the Archbishop's Library at Udine.  The Grimani Breviary, now in the Biblioteca Marciana of Venice, is a key work in the late history of Flemish illuminated manuscripts.  It was produced in Ghent and Bruges ca 1515-1520 and by 1520 owned, though possibly not originally commissioned, by Domenico Grimani. Several leading artists, including Simon Bening and Gerard David contributed some of their finest work to it.Grimani also wrote several theological treatises, and translated John Chrysostom's homilies.

A contemporary description of her during the election of her spouse to Doge of Venice in 1789 related, ""The triumph of the Doge must be somewhat dampened by his wife, who, by some womanish singularity, is not pleased at becoming Dogaressa. She would not appear at any of the feasts, but has hidden herself, according to some, at Murano, others say she has taken refuge in her steward's house!"" Grimani was described as modest and simple. Grimani suffered from a long lasting terminal illness, resulting in large amounts of anxiety, but is said to have maintained a firmness of mind until her death in Treviso.

"Francesco Lazzaro Guardi (Italian pronunciation: [franˈtʃesko ˈgwardi]; 5 October 1712 – 1 January 1793) was an Italian painter, nobleman, and a member of the Venetian School. [SEP] He is considered to be among the last practitioners, along with his brothers, of the classic Venetian school of painting. In the early part of his career he collaborated with his older brother Gian Antonio in the production of religious paintings. After Gian Antonio's death in 1760, Francesco concentrated on vedute. The earliest of these show the influence of Canaletto, but he gradually adopted a looser style characterized by spirited brush-strokes and freely imagined architecture.    Francesco Guardi was born in Venice into a family of nobility from Trentino. His father Domenico (born in 1678) and his brothers Niccolò and Gian Antonio were also painters, later inheriting the family workshop after the father's death in 1716. They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to Francesco. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. In 1735, Guardi moved to the workshop of Michele Marieschi, where he remained until 1743. His first certain works are from 1738, for a parish at Vigo d'Anuania, in Trentino. In this period he worked alongside his older brother, Gian Antonio. The first work signed by Francesco is a Saint Adoring the Eucharist (c. 1739).  His works in this period included both landscapes and figure compositions. His early vedutas show influence both from Canaletto and Luca Carlevarijs. On 15 February 1757, he married Maria Mattea Pagani, the daughter of painter Matteo Pagani. In 1760 his brother Gian Antonio died and his first son, Vincenzo, was born. His second son, Giacomo, was born in 1764. In 1763 he worked in Murano, in the church of San Pietro Martire, finishing a Miracle of a Dominican Saint clearly influenced by Alessandro Magnasco in its quasi-expressionistic style. Francesco Guardi's most important later works include the Doge's Feasts, a series of twelve canvases celebrating the ceremonies held in 1763 for the election of Doge Alvise IV Mocenigo. In his later years, Canaletto's influence on his art diminished, as shown by the Piazzetta in the Ca' d'Oro of Venice. In circa 1778, he painted the severe Holy Trinity Appearing to Sts. Peter and Paul in the parish church of Roncegno.  In 1782 Guardi was commissioned by the Venetian government six canvases to celebrate the visit of the Russian Archdukes in the city, of which only two remain, and two others for that of Pope Pius VI. On September 12 of that year he was admitted to the Fine Art Academy of Venice. A stronger attention to colours is present in late works such as the Concerto of 80 Orphans of 1782, now in Munich, in the Façade of Palace with Staircase in the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo. Guardi died at Campiello de la Madona in Cannaregio (Venice) in 1793.     Among all the paintings attributed to either Francesco and his brother Gian Antonio Guardi, the most praised work is not a landscape, but instead the airy sfumato Story of Tobit painted for the organ loft in the small Chiesa dell'Angelo San Raffaele. To quote from the Web Gallery of Art:  Perspective, organized aerial space, the Palladian solidity of Tiepolo... are exchanged for a personal style of coloured handwriting – now brilliantly calligraphic, and now brilliantly cloudy. Guardi's painterly style is known as pittura di tocco (of touch) for its small dotting and spirited brush-strokes. This looser style of painting had been used by Giovanni Piazzetta and Sebastiano Ricci, and recalls, in some religious themes, the sweetened sfumato of Barocci's Bolognese style. In this he differs from the more linear and architecturally accurate style of Canaletto's painting. This style, a century later, would make Guardi's works highly prized by the French Impressionists. Canaletto, as a vedutista, concentrated on glamorous urban architecture erected by the serene republic; on the other hand, in Guardi, the buildings often appear to be melting and sinking into a murky lagoon. Canaletto's canvases often have intricate linear and brilliant details, and depict Venice in sunny daylight. Guardi paints clouded skies above a city at dusk. These contrasts, however, simplify the facts, since Canaletto often painted the drab communal life and neighborhoods (creating in them some epic artistic qualities), while Guardi did not avoid sometimes painting the ceremonies of Ducal Venice. Ultimately, Guardi's paintings evoke the onset of the dissipation. The citizenry has shrunken to an impotent lilliputian crowd of ""rubber-neckers"", unable to rescue the crumbling Republic, as for example in the Fire in the Oil Depot in San Marcuola. It was fitting depiction of the rapidly declining empire, which had declined, in Napoleon's assessment, into a ""drawing room of Europe"" peopled with casinos, carnivals, and courtesans for hire.

"Nathan (Nata) ben Moses Hannover (Hebrew:   ‎) was a Ruthenian Jewish historian, Talmudist, and kabbalist.

Later he became rabbi of Iași, Moldavia, and afterward, according to Jacob Aboab, he returned to Italy. He died, according to Leopold Zunz (Kalender, 5623, p. 18), at Ungarisch-Brod, Moravia, on 14 July 1663. Jacob Aboab, however, in a letter to Unger (Wolf, Bibl. Hebr. iii., No. 1728), gives Pieve di Sacco, Italy, as the place of Hannover's death, without indicating the date. The place of his birth is equally uncertain. According to Graziadio Nepi-Mordecai Ghirondi, (Toledot Gedole Yisrael, p. 270) he was born at Kraków, but Steinschneider claims that ""Nathan Hannover"" and ""Nathan of Kraków"" were two different individuals.    Hannover is chiefly known for his work entitled Yeven Mezulah (Venice, 1653), which describes the course of the Khmelnytsky Uprising in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from a Jewish perspective. Hannover in this work gives a brief description of the Polish Crown of the time and of the relations between the Poles, Jews and Cossacks, and the causes which led to the uprising. He also gives a very vivid picture of Jewish life in Poland and the yeshivot. This work, owing to its literary value, was translated into Yiddish (1687), into German (1720), and into French by Daniel Levy (published by Benjamin II, Tlemçen, 1855). This last translation was revised by the historian J. Lelewel, and served as a basis for Meyer Kayserling's German translation (also published by Benjamin II, Hanover, 1863). Kostomarov, utilizing Salomon Mandelkern's Russian translation, gives many extracts from it in his Bogdan Chmielnicki (iii. 283-306). In the late 20th century some historians disputed the numbers given Yeven Mezulah. They claim it overstates of Jewish casualties during the Bohdan Khmelnytsky rebellion in 1648 and 1649. These authors tend to question it as a reliable historical source in spite of its literary qualities. Yeven Mezulah was criticized in particular by Shaul Stampfer, Edward Fram, Paul Robert Magocsi's ""Ukraine: A History"", and Petro Mirchuk. However others autors regard it as a reliable historical account.   "
"Francesco Hayez (Italian: [franˈtʃesko ˈaːjets]; 10 February 1791 – 12 February 1882) was an Italian painter. [SEP] He is considered one of the leading artists of Romanticism in mid-19th-century Milan, and is renowned for his grand historical paintings, political allegories, and portraits.     Francesco Hayez was from a relatively poor family from Venice. His father, Giovanni, was of French origin while his mother, Chiara Torcella, was from Murano. Francesco was the youngest of five sons. He was brought up by his mother's sister, who had married Giovanni Binasco, a well-off shipowner and art collector. Hayez displayed a predisposition for drawing since childhood. His uncle, having noticed his precocious talent, apprenticed him to an art restorer in Venice. Hayez would later became a pupil of the painter Francesco Maggiotto with whom he continued his studies for three years. He was admitted to the painting course of the New Academy of Fine Arts in Venice in 1806, where he studied under Teodoro Matteini. In 1809 he won a competition from the Academy of Venice for a one year residency at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. He remained in Rome until 1814, then moved to Naples where he was commissioned by Joachim Murat to paint a major work depicting Ulysses at the court of Alcinous. In the mid-1830s he attended the Maffei Salon in Milan, hosted by Clara Maffei. Maffei's husband would later commissioned Hayez a portrait of his wife. In 1850 Hayez was appointed director of the Brera Academy. Over the course of a long career, Hayez proved to be particularly prolific. His output included historic paintings designed to appeal to the patriotic sensibility of his patrons as well as works reflecting the desire to accompany a Neoclassic style to grand themes, either from biblical or classical literature. He also painted scenes from theatrical presentations. Conspicuously absent from his oeuvre, however, are altarpieces - possibly due to the  Napoleonic invasions that deconsecrated many churches and convents in Northern Italy. Art historian Corrado Ricci described Hayez as a classicist who then evolved into a style of emotional tumult.  His portraits have the intensity of Ingres and the Nazarene movement. Often sitting, Hayez's subjects are often dressed in austere, black and white clothing, with little to no accoutrements. While Hayez made portraits for the nobility, he also explored other subjects like fellow artists and musicians. Late in his career, he is known to have worked using photographs. One of Hayez's favorite themes was semi-clothed Odalisque evocative of oriental themes – a favorite topic of Romantic painters. The depictions of harems and their women allowed artists the ability to paint scenes otherwise not acceptable within society. Even Hayez's  Mary Magdalene has more sensuality than religious fervor. Hayez's painting The Kiss was considered among his best work by his contemporaries, and is possibly his most well-known effort. The anonymous, unaffected gesture of the couple does not require knowledge of myth or literature to interpret, and appeals to a modern gaze.A scientific assessment of Hayez's career has been made complicated by his proclivity for not signing or dating his works. Often dates in his paintings indicate when the work was acquired or sold, not the time of its creation. Moreover, he often painted the same compositions several times with minimal variations if any at all.  Among his pupils from the Brera Academy were Carlo Belgioioso, Amanzio Cattaneo, Alessandro Focosi, Giovanni Battista Lamperti, Livo Pecora, Angelo Pietrasanta, Antonio Silo, Carlo Antonio Tavella, Ismaele Teglio Milla and Francesco Valaperta. Hayez died in Milan, age 91. His studio at the Brera Academy is marked with a plate.   "

"Lawrence Justinian (Italian: Lorenzo Giustiniani, 1 July 1381 – 8 January 1456) is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church. [SEP] He was a canon regular who was appointed as a bishop and became the first Patriarch of Venice.    Lawrence Justinian was a member of the well-known Giustiniani family, which includes several saints. The piety of his mother seems to have served as an inspiration for his own spirituality, as he chose of a life of prayer and service. In 1404, after he had been ordained a deacon, at the suggestion of an uncle who was a priest, he joined a community of canons regular following a monastic form of life on the island of San Giorgio in Alga. He was admired by his fellows for his poverty, mortification, and fervency of prayer. Two years after his ordination to the Catholic priesthood in 1407, the community accepted the Rule of St. Augustine. He was chosen to be the first prior of the community.Lawrence promoted the Constitutions which had been established for the Canons of St. George, which was embraced by other communities of Canons in the region and shortly thereafter he became the Prior General of a Congregation. He was so zealous in spreading it that he was looked upon as if he were the actual founder of the Order. In 1433, Pope Eugene IV, one of the founders of the Monastery of San Giorgio, named Gustiniani as the Bishop of Castello. He found a diocese in shambles and his administration was marked by considerable growth and reform. In 1451, Pope Nicholas V united the Diocese of Castello with the Patriarchate of Grado, and the seat of the patriarchate was moved to Venice, making Giustiniani the first Patriarch of Venice, a post that he held for over four years. It was during Lawrence's rule that Constantinople fell to Muslim forces. Due to their centuries of close trading partnerships with Byzantine Empire, the people of Venice were in panic as to their future. He took a leading role in helping the Republic to deal with the crisis, working with the Senate to help chart its future, as well as with the clergy and people to calm them.     		 		   He died on January 8, 1456, and was canonized by Pope Alexander VIII (1689–1691). His works, consisting of sermons, letters and ascetic treatises, have been frequently reprinted. Pope Innocent XII (1691–1700) inserted his feast day in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 5 September, the anniversary of his elevation to the episcopate. Because of the saint's limited importance worldwide, his liturgical celebration is no longer included in the General Roman Calendar, and his feast was moved to 8 January, the day of his death.

"Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger (also: Johann(es) Hieronymus Kapsberger or Giovanni Geronimo Kapsperger; c. 1580 – 17 January 1651) was a German-Italian virtuoso performer and composer of the early Baroque period. [SEP] A prolific and highly original composer, Kapsberger is chiefly remembered today for his lute and theorbo (chitarrone) music, which was seminal in the development of these as solo instruments.    Nothing is known about Kapsberger's date and place of birth. His father Colonel Wilhelm (Guglielmo) von Kapsperger was a military official of the Imperial House of Austria, and may have settled in Venice, the city which may have been Kapsberger's birthplace. After 1605 Kapsberger moved to Rome, where he quickly attained a reputation as a brilliant virtuoso. He cultivated connections with various powerful individuals and organizations; and himself organized ""academies"" in his house, which were counted among the ""wonders of Rome"". Around 1609 Kapsberger married Gerolima di Rossi, with whom he had at least three children. He started publishing his music at around the same time, with more than a dozen collections of music appearing during the next ten years. These included the celebrated Libro I d'intavolatura di lauto (1611), Kapsberger's only surviving collection of music for lute.In 1624 Kapsperger entered the service of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, where he worked with numerous important composers (such as Girolamo Frescobaldi and Stefano Landi) and poets (which included Giulio Rospigliosi, the future Pope Clement IX). Kapsberger worked in Francesco's household until 1646. He died in 1651.   "

"David ben Judah Messer Leon (c. 1470 in Venice – c. 1526 in Salonica) was an Italian rabbi, physician and writer, who defended the value of secular disciplines and the Renaissance humanities as an important part of traditional Jewish studies. [SEP]    David ben Judah was educated at Naples in the school of his father, Judah Messer Leon, author of Libnat ha-Sappir, and received at the age of eighteen his rabbinical diploma from German and French Talmudic authorities. Soon afterward he went to Padua, where he studied under Judah Minz, who granted him a new rabbinical diploma. After further studies in Florence, he returned to Naples in 1492, where he practised as a physician and taught in his father's academy. However, in 1495 the city fell to the French under Charles VIII, and he fled east to the Ottoman Empire to escape the violent pogroms that ensued, spending time in Istanbul before moving sometime between 1498 and 1504 to teach Torah in Salonica, at that time in a state of intellectual vibrancy due to the settlement there of many Sephardi exiles forced to leave after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, Sicily in 1493, and Portugal in 1496. It was while he was at Salonica that he completed his most major work, the Ein ha-Kore (Eye of the Reader), a sympathetic commentary defending Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, criticizing the commentary of Isaac Abravanel.  The reputation of the book spread, and he was called to the rabbinate of Avlona in 1510 at a salary of 70 florins a year. The community possessed three congregations of various nationalities, and Leon officiated successively in the three synagogues on every third Saturday. In the very first year of his rabbinate dissensions on account of a ritual question arose which caused the separation of the Portuguese and Catalan Jews from the Castilians. Toward the end of his second year in Avlona a quarrel broke out among the Sephardim and the Portuguese. Leon, who sided with the Portuguese, had for antagonists Abraham Ḥarbon and Abraham de Collier. Excommunications were launched by both parties even on the Day of Atonement, before the Sephardim finally relented.  Some time later R. David returned to Salonica, where he died whilst still writing his last book.   "
"Giacomo Leoni (1686 – 8 June 1746), also known as James Leoni, was an Italian architect, born in Venice. [SEP] He was a devotee of the work of Florentine Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti, who had also been an inspiration for Andrea Palladio. Leoni thus served as a prominent exponent of Palladianism in English architecture, beginning in earnest around 1720. Also loosely referred to as Georgian, this style is rooted in Italian Renaissance architecture. Having previously worked in Düsseldorf, Leoni arrived in England, where he was to make his name, in 1714, aged 28. His fresh, uncluttered designs, with just a hint of baroque flamboyance, brought him to the attention of prominent patrons of the arts.     Leoni's early life is poorly documented. He is first recorded in Düsseldorf in 1708, and arrived in England sometime before 1715.  Between 1715 and 1720 he published in installments the first complete English language edition of Palladio's I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura, which Leoni entitled The Architecture of A. Palladio, in Four Books. The translation was a huge success and went into multiple editions in the following years (illustration, left) Despite Leoni's often eccentric alterations to Palladio's illustrations, his edition became a main vehicle for disseminating the essence of Palladio's style among British designers. The direct impact of Palladio's text was upon building patrons, for these expensive volumes were out of the reach of most builders, who could consult them only briefly in a gentleman's library.  In 1738 Isaac Ware, with the encouragement of Richard Boyle, third Earl of Burlington, produced a more accurate translation of Palladio's work with illustrations which were faithful to the originals, but Leoni's changes and inaccuracies continued to influence Palladianism for generations.On the frontispiece of his edition of Palladio, Leoni titled himself ""Architect to his most serene Highness the Elector Palatine."" This claim, however, remains unsubstantiated.Leoni followed his Palladian volume with an English translation of Alberti's De Re Aedificatoria (""On Architecture""), the first modern book on the theories and practice of architecture.

"Alessandro Leopardi (sometimes called Leopardo) (1466 – 1512) was a Venetian  sculptor, bronze founder and architect. [SEP]    Leopardi was born and died in Venice. He is first heard of in 1482 and is said to have worked at the mint. He was once reputed to have designed the sepulchral monument of doge Andrea Vendramin, now in the church of San Giovanni e Paolo, but this is generally now thought to have been the work of Tullio Lombardo, though Leopardi may have contributed some figures.In 1479 he submitted a model for the competition initiated by the Signoria in Venice to find a sculptor for an equestrian monument to Bartolomeo Colleoni. Three sculptors submitted models including Andrea Verrocchio to whom the contract was awarded.Leopardi was exiled for 5 years on a charge of fraud in 1487, and recalled in 1490 by the senate to finish Verrocchio's impressive statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni, which the Venetians had commissioned him to make in accordance with the provisions of Colleoni's will. Verocchio, having made the clay model in Venice, had died in 1488, before it had been cast in bronze. He asked in his will that his pupil, Lorenzo di Credi, should be engaged to arrange for it to be cast, but after much delay the Venetians in 1490 selected Leopardi to cast it and he also made the pedestal on which it stands. His name (in Latin) is inscribed on the horse's girth: ""ALEXANDER . LEOPARDUS . V . P . OPUS"", so that early authorities thought that the work was entirely his. The work is universally admired, though John Pope-Hennessy thought that, if Verrrochio had finished it himself, it would have been even finer.When Colleoni bequeathed the money for his statue, he stipulated that it should be erected in the Piazza San Marco, but the Venetian state could not allow this and compromised by having it installed near the Scuola San Marco outside the church of SS Giovanni è Paolo, where it stands today. Leopardi worked between 1503 and 1505 on the chapel of Cardinal Zeno at St. Mark's, which was finished by 1515 by Antonio Lombardo and Tullio Lombardo.In 1505 he designed and cast the bronze bases, decorated in high relief, for the three great mast-like flagpoles in the Piazza San Marco. Each base is different and that in the centre has on a medallion a profile of the doge, Leonardo Loredan.  His model for the rebuilding of the Scuola Vecchia della Misericordia in Venice was provisionally accepted by the Scuola in 1507, but little progress was made with the project and in 1531, after Leopardi's death, it was superseded by Sansovino's model, although this also was never completed.Later, he was engaged on the new church of Santa Giustina in Padua.After the disastrous fire at the Rialto in January 1514 he was one of the four architects who submitted models for the rebuilding of the area, but the contract was given to Scarpagnino.

"Luigi Lippomano (also Alvise, or Aloisio, in Latin Aloisius Lipomanus) (1496, Venice  – 15 August 1559, Rome) was an Italian bishop and hagiographer. [SEP]    Luigi Lippomano was the illegitimate son of Venetian patrician Bartolo Lippomano, who determined to provide an ecclesiastical career for his son. He graduated from the university at Padua and eventually entered into service at the papal court in Rome. Distinguished for his piety and integrity of character, he was among the first in Rome to join the ""Oratorio della Carità"" founded by St. Cajetan of Tiene, and composed of distinguished men, who in the Roman Curia were the leaven of Church reform, and afterwards took a prominent part in the Council of Trent. In 1528 he accompanied the court of Pope Clement VII to Orvieto after the sack of Rome by imperial troops. Later that year he sent his brother Thomas a detailed firsthand report of the great flood of the Tiber. In 1538, he was consecrated titular Bishop of Methone by Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa, future Pope Paul IV, and appointed coadjutor cum jure successionis to his cousin Pietro Lippomano, Bishop of Bergamo, who was also active in Catholic reform. Due to his illegitimate birth and some say also opposition from German cardinals, Luigi would never become a cardinal. In 1542 Pope Paul III sent him as nuncio to Portugal to announce the convocation of the Council of Trent. He returned to Italy and took an active part in the council, following the council fathers to Bologna in 1547, where he attended all the sessions. When Pietro was transferred to Verona in 1544, Luigi accompanied him. Pietro died in Edinburgh Castle during the summer of 1548 while on a diplomatic mission in Scotland, and Luigi succeeded him as Bishop of Verona.In 1548 he was sent with Bertano and Pighi to Germany. From 1551 he was one of the presidents of the Council until its suspension (25 April 1552), during that period the dogmatic decrees on the Eucharist, penance, and extreme unction were published, as well as several decrees on reform. In 1555 Pope Paul IV sent him as nuncio to Poland, where, on account of his lively opposition to the pretensions of the Protestant nobility, his reception was mixed. Tired and sick he returned to Verona in February 1557, and later, after recovery to Rome, where he stayed until his death on August 15, 1559.   "

"Baldassare Longhena (1598 – 18 February 1682) was an Italian architect, who worked mainly in Venice, where he was one of the greatest exponents of Baroque architecture of the period. [SEP]    Born in Venice, Longhena studied under the architect Vincenzo Scamozzi and after Scamozzi's death completed his monumental Procuratie Nuove in St. Mark's Square, a complex of imposing residences and offices for officials of the Venetian Republic that gives the square its appearance today. His best-known work is the elegantly decorated Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute begun in 1631 to thank the Virgin for the city's deliverance from the plague. This two domed church on the peninsula between the Canal Grande and the Zattere is one of the city's best-known landmarks. The main entrance, modeled on the Roman triumphal arch, was later copied in successive churches and cathedrals, in Venice and elsewhere. He designed many other churches in the city, among them the Chiesa dell'Ospedaletto and Santa Maria di Nazareth built between 1656 and 1680, although the façade of the latter church was designed by Giuseppe Sardi (1624–1699). He also designed the Palazzo Belloni Battagia and the Palazzo Giustiniani Lolin, both facing the Canal Grande. One of his largest designs was the Chioggia Cathedral, executed between 1624 and 1647. On the completion of the cathedral he designed two other palaces on the Grand Canal of Venice, Ca' Rezzonico and Ca' Pesaro, both completed after his death. Between 1641 and 1680 he designed the new library, the grand staircase, the monastery façade, the Novitiate building, the sick-room and the guest-rooms of the San Giorgio Maggiore monastery. Baldassare Longhena died at Venice in 1682.    Longhena developed the style of his master Vincenzo Scamozzi and Andrea Palladio. As Branko Mitrovic states in his book on renaissance architecture: ""Scamozzi...adjusted the central intercolumnation of the main portico so that the edges of columns can be seen from the end of a circular hall. Visually, this is a way to suggest from inside that there is another formal space beyond the entrance door... Baldassare Longhena used a similar system of non-orthogonal axes in Santa Maria della Salute in Venice. As with Palladio, it is unclear whether Longhena intended to form such visual axes or whether they are a by-product of his complex geometries.""   "
"Pietro Longhi (1702 or November 5, 1701 – May 8, 1785) was a Venetian painter of contemporary genre scenes of life. [SEP]    Pietro Longhi was born in Venice in the parish of Saint Maria, first child of the silversmith Alessandro Falca and his wife, Antonia. He adopted the Longhi last name when he began to paint. He was initially taught by the Veronese painter Antonio Balestra, who then recommended the young painter to apprentice with the Bolognese Giuseppe Maria Crespi, who was highly regarded in his day for both religious and genre painting and was influenced by the work of Dutch painters. Longhi returned to Venice before 1732. He was married in 1732 to Caterina Maria Rizzi, by whom he had eleven children (only three of which reached the age of maturity). Among his early paintings are some altarpieces and religious themes. His first major documented work was an altarpiece for the church of San Pellegrino in 1732. In 1734, he completed frescoes in the walls and ceiling of the hall in Ca' Sagredo, representing the Death of the giants. In the late 1730s, he began to specialize in the small-scale genre works that would lead him to be viewed in the future as the Venetian William Hogarth, painting subjects and events of everyday life in Venice. Longhi's gallant interior scenes reflect the 18th century's turn towards the private and the bourgeois, and were extremely popular. Many of his paintings show Venetians at play, such as the depiction of the crowd of genteel citizens awkwardly gawking at a freakish Indian rhinoceros. This painting, on display at the National Gallery in London, chronicles Clara the rhinoceros brought to Europe in 1741 by a Dutch sea captain and impresario from Leyden, Douvemont van der Meer. This rhinoceros was exhibited in Venice in 1751. There are two versions of this painting, nearly identical except for the unmasked portraits of two men in Ca' Rezzonico version. Ultimately, there may be a punning joke to the painting, since the young man on the left holds aloft the sawed-off horn (metaphor for cuckoldry) of the animal. Perhaps this explains the difference between the unchaperoned women.   Other paintings chronicle the daily activities such as the gambling parlors (Ridotti) that proliferated in the 18th century. Nearly half of the figures in his genre paintings are faceless, hidden behind Venetian Carnival masks. In some, the insecure or naive posture and circumstance, the puppet-like delicacy of the persons, seem to suggest a satirical perspective of the artists toward his subjects. That this puppet-like quality was an intentional conceit on Longhi's part is attested by the skillful rendering of figures in his earlier history paintings and in his drawings. Longhi's many drawings, typically in black chalk or pencil heightened with white chalk on colored paper, were often done for their own sake, rather than as studies for paintings. In the 1750s, Longhi—like Crespi before him—was commissioned to paint seven canvases documenting the seven Catholic sacraments. These are now in Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia along with his scenes from the hunt (Caccia). From 1763 Longhi was Director of the Academy of Drawing and Carving. From this period, he began to work extensively with portraiture, and was actively assisted by his son, Alessandro. Longhi died on 8 May 1785, following a short illness.    Celebrated genre canvases were produced by other contemporary artists in Italy such as Gaspare Traversi and Giuseppe Maria Crespi. Longhi had not only departed the world of grand mythology of history that often allured the Venetian nobility, but also taken residence in its intimate present, as few painters in Venice had ever done. If Canaletto and Guardi are our window to the external rituals of the republic, Longhi is our window to what happened inside rooms. The critic Bernard Berenson states that: Longhi painted for the picture-loving Venetians their own lives in all their ordinary domestic and fashionable phases. In the hair-dressing scenes, we hear the gossip of the periwigged barber; in the dressmaking scenes, the chatter of the maid; in the dancing-school, the pleasant music of the violin. There is no tragic note anywhere. Everybody dresses, dances, makes bows, takes coffee, as if there were nothing else in the world that wanted doing. A tone of high courtesy, of great refinement, coupled with an all-pervading cheerfulness, distinguishes Longhi's pictures from the works of Hogarth, at once so brutal and so full of presage of change.    In numerous paintings, Longhi depicts masked figures engaging in various acts from gambling to flirting. For example, in the foreground of Longhi's painting The Meeting of the Procuratore and His Wife is a woman being greeted by a man that is presumed to be her husband. The setting is of a type of gathering place usually for masked people to engage in private matters such as romantic encounters. The woman and her husband are unmasked, but at the left, a seated woman is unmasking herself to address a masked man leaning over her shoulder. This act may suggest that the woman's Moretta mask, which lacks an opening for the mouth, requires her to unmask herself in order to speak; another interpretation is that the woman is interested enough in the masked man to remove her mask in order to reveal her true identity to him.In The Charlatan (1757) the title character is relegated to the background, where he stands on top of a table surrounded by admiring women and a young boy. In the foreground, a masked woman seems to fiddle with her fan and slyly look at a masked man who lifts part of her dress. There is a sense of duality as the ordinary event of the man on the top of the table is contrasted with the reality of Venetian life represented by the couple indulging themselves; this is similar to the duality of the mask used by his subjects to hide physically, but to expose their unconscious desires. In The Ridotto in Venice (ca. 1750s), Longhi depicts one of the main gambling halls in Venice. The scene is crowded with masked and unmasked figures. The focal point in this work depicts a now-familiar scene of a shy woman and an aggressive man who lifts her dress. Repeating the figures of the flirtatious couple, Longhi displays the Ridotto as a place where the social elite— who would not exhibit such behavior in public nor unmasked—would abandon all inhibitions and pursue their actual desires.

"Lorenzo Veneziano ('Lorenzo the Venetian') (active 1356–1372) was an important painter in Venice during the second half of the 14th century. [SEP]   He was the first painter of the Venetian school who commenced the move away from the Byzantine models preferred by the Venetians towards the Gothic style.  His work had an important influence on the next generation of Venetian painters.    The artist's activity is confirmed during the period of 1356 to 1372.  Art historians have gradually abandoned the view that the artist should be identified with the painter who signed as 'Lorenzo pentor di S Marina' in 1379.It was formerly believed that the artist trained with Paolo Veneziano but there is no evidence to support this view.He appears to have worked extensively outside the Venetian area, possibly because he was not successful in getting commissions from the Venetian Republic.     The lack of biographical data on the artist have made it difficult to assess his evolution and influences.  His earliest signed work is an altarpiece referred to as the Annunciation Polyptych or the Lion Polyptych painted for the high altar of the church of Sant' Antonio di Castello (now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice). It is dated 1357. An inscription on the polyptych claims it was commissioned by the patrician Domenico Lion.  The altarpiece represents the Annunciation with a portrait of the donor Domenico Lion, the Christ in benediction, and figures of various Saints.  The scene of the Annunciation on the central table and the Prophets of the upper register manifest an increased modern sensibility as well as a receptiveness to new artistic directions already present in Piedmont. Various features of the Annunciation Polyptych seem to point to Lorenzo's direct knowledge of Venetian and Emilian models.  These include the expressive intensity of the faces, the dynamic articulation of the drapes and the abandonment of the Byzantine manner of letting the dark base colors shine through the flesh of persons. Lorenzo favored a chromatic quality with refined timbres and delicate nuances of the local tone.The Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice also possesses an altarpiece by Lorenzo executed in 1371. It originally consisted of five panels, on which an Annunciation and six figures of saints were painted, but it is now broken up into separate works. Also by Lorenzo is Saviour Enthroned with Saints and Angels dated 1369 in the Museo Correr, Venice.Lorenzo had an important impact on painting in Venice in the last decades of the 14th century. Artists such as Guglielmo Veneziano, Giovanni da Bologna, Catarino Veneziano, Stefano di Sant'Agnese, in particular, and Jacobello di Bonomo, to a more limited extent, were influenced by his style.

"Teofilo Macchetti (Venice, March 3rd 1632 – Pisa, 1714) was an Italian composer and music theorist. [SEP]    Macchetti studied music in Venice and joined the Benedictine Order, which assigned him to the monastery in Rovigo as solicitor in 1669. He stayed in Rovigo until 1674, but his interest for history and music caused him to travel for research to Venice (in 1672 and in 1673) and to Rome, where he stayed for four years (from 1675 to 1679). After that he made stops in Loreto and Spoleto, and then settled in Pisa, where he became Chapel Master of the Duomo in 1681. Macchetti kept this role for the rest of his life, supervising the musical life in Pisa and teaching regularly (his most well-known student was Giovan Carlo Maria Clari); however, he continued to travel for his studies of music history (documented stays in Rome, Volterra, Siena, and numerous other Tuscan cities).     While working, Macchetti kept a detailed diary, entitled Conti di musiche (translated as Tales of Music, or Musical Tales, or Tales from Music), which is preserved today in the Biblioteca Universitaria of Pisa. From the notes in his diary, precious information regarding the musical activity of a 1600-1700 chapel can be understood. Macchetti describes his duties, the music that was performed, and his academic activity in minute detail. In addition, he documented many distinctive traits of the music performed at that time.    His interest for antique music is gathered in Curiosità musicali (translated as Musical Curiosity, or Music Trivia) which dates back to beginning in 1711 and is preserved today in the Biblioteca Universitaria of Pisa. In Curiosità, Macchetti verifies many anecdotes about antique music circulating at the time (for example, the anecdote that Pythagoras understood the concept of musical consonance by listening to the sound of hammers on anvils), attests the circulation of medieval dissertations as well as those of the Renaissance in Italy (Macchetti demonstrated knowing very well the dissertations of  Johannes de Muris, Johannes Tinctoris, Glarean, Vincenzo Galilei and Athanasius Kircher) reflecting on the concept of tempo, and studied the evolution of performance customs (for example, he observed how the mass Aeterna Christi munera by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina was performed more quickly over the years). The Curiosità represents the first Italian attempt at creating a true and proper History of Music, which precedes, by almost 40 years, the most famous treaty of Giovanni Battista Martini in which he recognizes Curiosità musicali as its essential foundation. The angle of Curiosità is much more practical than theoretical, and it also documents the customs of performance of the time. This last fact renders it a priceless direct source for performance customs of sacred music of the 1700s.   "

Before that, at the capture of Gallipoli from the Ottoman Turks, the captain-general was shot down on his poop deck as the battle was about to commence; Malipiero modestly and matter-of-factly recounts that he spread a sheet over the captain's body and put it about that the captain was merely severely wounded.  In semi-retirement from his maritime career he served as the Venetian governor of Rovigo (1494), Rimini (1505), Napoli di Romania (1510) and of Treviso in the year of his death.He kept a chronicle in the Venetian language of the history of Venice which runs from 1457 to 1500, and offers details of the Venetian wars with the Sultan. Malipiero's Annali, the Diarii of Marino Sanudo and the diaries of Girolamo Priuli are the triumvirate of primary sources in the Serenissima,  ""a full, vivacious and veracious narrative of Venetian history, of life in the city, of wars and intrigues of the Republic, during her splendour and the beginning of her decline (1457–1535)"" In the later sixteenth century the diaries came into the hands of Francesco Longo, who made an abridged copy of them, which was printed under the title Annali veneti dell'anno 1457–1500. The originals have disappeared.   "
"Pietro Malombra (1556–1618) was an Italian painter of the late-Renaissance, active in his adoptive city of Venice. [SEP] He was an educated man who became chancellor of the republic.

He often represented events of state, but also decorated government offices and churches in Venice and Padua. He was also a poet.. He was born to a wealthy family, and initially painted for joy, but soon became impoverished, and had to paint for sustenance. He painted a number of canvases for the church  of San Francesco di Paola in the sestiere of Castello in Venice. He is known for painting civic functions of the councils of Venice. He died in Venice. His son, Giuseppe Malombra, was also a painter.   "
"Daniele Manin (13 May 1804 – 22 September 1857) was an Italian patriot, statesman and leader of the Risorgimento in Venice. [SEP] He is considered by many Italian historians a hero of the Italian unification.     Daniele Manin was born Daniele Fonseca in Ramo Astori, Venice, where his birthplace is commemorated by a plaque. His mother Anna Maria Bellotto, an Italian, came from Padua, while his father Pietro Antonio Fonseca (1762–1829) came from a converted family that was originally Jewish: Daniele's grandfather was Samuele Medina, from Verona. Samuele converted to Christianity in 1759 and took the name Manin because Lodovico Manin sponsored his conversion. Daniele Manin studied law at Padua, and then practised at the bar in Venice, his native city.  A man of great learning and a profound jurist, from an early age he held a deep hatred for Austria.Manin's niece was the painter and printmaker Leopoldina Zanetti Borzino.    The heroic but hopeless attempt of the Bandiera Brothers, Venetians who had served in the Austrian navy against the Neapolitan Bourbons in 1844, was the first event to cause an awakening of Venetian patriotism.  In 1847 Manin presented a petition to the Venetian congregation, a powerless consultative assembly tolerated by Austria, informing the emperor of the wants of the nation. He was arrested on a charge of high treason (18 January 1848), but his arrest only served to agitate of the Venetians, who were beginning to appreciate Manin.  Two months later, when all Italy and half the rest of Europe were in the throes of revolution, the people of Venice forced Count Pallfy (Erdődy Pállfy Alajos gróf), the Austrian governor, to release Manin (17 March). The Austrians soon lost control of the city: the Arsenal was seized by revolutionaries and, under the direction of Manin, a civic guard and a provisional government were instituted. The Austrians withdrew from Venice on 26 March and Manin became president of the re-created Republic of San Marco. He had already been in favour of Italian unity, but not anxious for annexation to Piedmont because he would have liked to enlist French aid.  He gave in to the will of the majority of his compatriots and resigned his powers to the Piedmontese commissioners on 7 August. But after the Piedmontese defeat at Custoza, and the armistice in which King Charles Albert abandoned Lombardy and Venetia to Austria, the Venetians attempted to lynch the royal commissioners, whose lives Manin saved with difficulty. An assembly was summoned, and a triumvirate formed with Manin at its head.Towards the end of 1848 the Austrians, having been heavily reinforced, reoccupied all the Venetian mainland. The citizens, however, hard-pressed and threatened with a siege, showed the greatest devotion to the cause of freedom, all sharing in the dangers and hardships and giving what they could afford to the state treasury.  Early in 1849 Manin was again chosen president of the Republic, and conducted the defence of the city with great ability.After the defeat of Charles Albert's troops at Novara in March, the Venetian assembly voted ""Resistance at all costs!"" and granted Manin unlimited powers.  Meanwhile, the Austrian forces closed round the city. Manin showed a good capability of organization, in which he was ably seconded by the Neapolitan general, Guglielmo Pepe, who led the Neapolitan army to defend Venice against his king's order.  But on 26 May the Venetians were forced to abandon Fort Marghera, halfway between the city and the mainland; food was becoming scarce, on 19 June the powder magazine blew up, and in July cholera broke out. The Austrian batteries, subsequently, began to bombard Venice itself, and when the Sardinian fleet withdrew from the Adriatic the city was also attacked by sea, while demagogues caused internal trouble.At last, on 24 August 1849, when all provisions and ammunition were exhausted, Manin, who had courted death in vain, succeeded in negotiating an honorable capitulation, on terms of amnesty to all save Manin himself, Pepe and some others, who were to go into exile. On 27 August Manin left Venice forever on board a French ship.    monarchism, being convinced that only under the auspices of King Victor Emmanuel could Italy be freed, and together with Giorgio Pallavicini and Giuseppe La Farina he founded the Società Nazionale Italiana with the object of propagating the idea of unity under the Piedmontese monarchy. His last years were embittered by the terrible sufferings of his daughter, who died in 1854.  He died on 22 September 1857, and was buried in Ary Scheffer's family tomb.In 1868, two years after the Austrians finally departed from Venice, his remains were brought to his native city and honoured with a public funeral. The gondola carrying his coffin was decorated with bow ""surmounted by the lion of Saint Mark, resplendent with gold"", bore ""the Venetian standard veiled with black crape"", and had ""two silver colossal statues waving the national colours of Italy"". The statues represented the unification of Italy and Venice. The funeral procession was described as ""magnificent"". His remains are interred in a sarcophagus, which is located in the Piazzetta dei Leoncini, on the north side of the Basilica San Marco.    According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition,  Manin was a man of the greatest honesty, and possessed genuinely statesmanlike qualities. He believed in Italian unity when most men, even Cavour, regarded it as a vain thing. For example, during the 1856 Congress of Paris, Manin met with Cavour to discuss the unification of Italy. After the meeting, Cavour wrote that Manin had talked about ""l'unità d'Italia ed altre corbellerie"" (""the unity of Italy and other nonsense"").  Manin's work of propaganda by means of the Italian National Society greatly contributed to the success of the cause.   "
"Alessandro Ignazio Marcello (Italian: [marˈtʃɛllo]; 1 February 1673 – 19 June 1747 in Venice) was an Italian nobleman and composer. [SEP]    Born in Venice, Marcello was the son of a senator. As such, he enjoyed a comfortable life that gave him the scope to pursue his interest in music. He was a contemporary of Tomaso Albinoni. He held concerts in his hometown and also composed and published several sets of concertos, including six concertos under the title of La Cetra (The Lyre), as well as cantatas, arias, canzonets, and violin sonatas. Marcello, being a slightly older contemporary of Antonio Vivaldi, often composed under the pseudonym Eterio Stinfalico, his name as a member of the celebrated Arcadian Academy (Pontificia Accademia degli Arcadi). He died in Padua in 1747. Alessandro's brother was the more well-known Benedetto Marcello, also a composer, who illegally married his singing student Rosanna Scalfi in 1728. After his death she was unable to inherit his estate, and in 1742 she filed suit against Alessandro Marcello, seeking financial support.   "
"Giorgio Massari (13 October 1687 – 20 December 1766) was an Italian late-Baroque  architect from Venice. [SEP] He designed the Villa Lattes near Treviso in 1715, the church of Santo Spritito in Udine, the church of Santa Maria della Pace 1720-46 in Brescia. In Venice, he often worked closely with Tiepolo in planning interior decoration of palaces.   Among his masterpieces are the Chiesa dei Gesuati (1726–43) located in Dorsoduro, Venice and the Palazzo Grassi-Stucky (1749). In the latter, Massari executed a traditional elegant marble-fronted Grand Canal palace facade, with Baroque rhythms and variations to the arrangement of bays, disrupting the classical simplicity. Massari also designed the scenographic staircase entry to Villa Giovanelli, Noventa Padovana. Massari finished some works by Longhena, for example, the heavily decorated Ca' Rezzonico, also found on the Grand Canal. Some of Massari's design were completed by his pupil Bernardino Maccarucci.

"Marcantonio Michiel (1484–1552) was a Venetian noble from a family prominent in the service of the State who was interested in matters of art. [SEP] His notes on the contemporary art collections of Venice, Padua, Milan and other northern Italian centres (Notizie d'opere del disegno), written sporadically between 1521 and 1543 and preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana, provide a major primary source for art historians and a less thoroughly inspected source for historians of décor.Michiel never worked up his notes into a publishable itinerary of art collections; ""his publication record is poor and mainly posthumous,"" Jennifer Fletcher has noted, ""and letters from friends hint at a certain lack of perseverance."" His diary was never intended to be read by the public, and his history of Venice was an endless project. Pietro Aretino wrote him a flattering letter praising his interests in painting, architecture and poetry. Iconography was his weak point: though his Latin was excellent, his knowledge of the Bible was desultory, and Jennifer Fletcher notes that no one ever took particular notice of his piety. He was comfortably well off, but not rich. He lived in the modest Ca' Michiel on a side canal and married the beautiful Maffea from the Soranzo family, built a villa, raised five sons and lived a private family life. In his youth he followed his father to Bergamo when the elder Michiel was appointed Capitano, and he spent two years in Rome at the court of Pope Leo X, as a member of the familia of Cardinal Pisani. His peers apparently did not want to entrust him with ambassadorial duties in spite of his rank and connections, and it is as a collector and connoisseur, that he is remembered.   "
"Francesco Migliori, also known as Francesco Megliori (c. 1684 -1734) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active mainly in his native Republic of Venice. [SEP]    His training is not known, though an adherence to the style of the tenebrosi suggests the school of Antonio Molinari. Migliori first appears in the records of the painter's guild starting in 1711. His name appears in 1722 as the author of a series of paintings in the inventory for the gallery of Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony. A first group of paintings depicts mostly biblical subjects: Cain and Abel, the Sacrifice of Isaac, a Joseph Interprets the Dreams, a Lot and His Daughters, and Cimon and Pero (destroyed, but of which we have reproductions). The influence of Bencovich and Piazetta is evident. Later, he sent two mythological scenes with Bacchus and Ariadne and the Rape of Europa (still in Gemäldegalerie of Dresden). Also from this decade appear to be two altarpieces, depicting the Adoration of the Magi and the Transit of St. Joseph, which once had been attributed to Gaspare Diziani. By 1718 he completed the altarpiece of the Assumption for the altar of the Blessed Assumption School in San Stae. About this time, he likely completed the altarpiece of the Crucifixion with Saints Lawrence, Lucia, and Rocco for the parish church of San Martino a Sambughè, in Treviso. In 1727-28 he completed the painted decoration of the organ doors of San Moise with  a St. Cecilia and an Adoration of the Golden Calf. Another artist active in the decoration of the choir was Francesco Pittoni (the uncle of Giambattista). He also completed an altarpiece of St. Anthony Resuscitates Father Martino for a chapel at the right in the church. He painted a small canvas depicting Christ and the Samaritan and a Christ and Mary Magdalene now at Rovigo. By 1728, he began to perform extensive works in the decoration of San Marcuola. Beginning in April 1728, he is documented to have painted a series of canvases about the titular saints of Ermagora and Fortunato for the church of San Marcuola, recently renovated by Giorgio Massari. By 1729-1731, he competed paintings for the sacristy of this church, depicting Fortunato Attends Ermagora's Martyrdom and the Baptism conferred by Ermagora to the martyred Saints Euphemia, Dorotea, Tecla, and Erasma, plus a ceiling canvas depicting the Glory of Saints Ermagora and Fortunato (1735). He also painted a second subject for presbytery with the Fall of Manna (August, 1735). He likely painted a Virgin of Sorrows and St. Francis of Paola now on the sides of the pulpit. He apparently painted the main altarpiece of the Assumption but that appears now replaced by a copy.  He may have played a role in a cycle of the Passion of Christ for the adjacent oratory, but the one remaining painting is attributed to Nicolò Bambini.   "
"Pietro Mingotti (born Venice, c. 1702; died Copenhagen, 28 April 1759) was an Italian impresario active across continental Europe. [SEP] His brother, Angelo, formed an opera company in Prague around 1732, consisting of three male singers and five females; Pietro quickly followed suit, and the two troupes achieved European-wide success (though mostly in German and Austrian cities), sometimes performing together. Pietro's company, the more high-profile of the two, at times included Christoph Willibald Gluck and Giuseppe Sarti as members. Most of the works performed belonged to the genre of opera seria, though opere buffe were also given. After performances at the coronation of Franz I at Frankfurt (Maria Theresa's husband) in 1745, and at a royal wedding at Dresden in 1747 (when Gluck's Le nozze d'Ercole e d'Ebe, with the composer conducting, was performed), Mingotti's troupe were invited to Copenhagen by Queen Louise in the same year. The company's repertory for the Danish court included not only operas but also ballets. Sarti joined the troupe in December 1752 as music director after Gluck left during 1750. Severe financial difficulties forced Pietro to end his contract with the court at Copenhagen in 1755, and he died impoverished four years later in the Danish capital. Little is known of Angelo Mingotti's later career; from 1743 until 1751 the Oper am Gänsemarkt was used by Angelo Mingotti, performing Italian operas.   "

"Abbot Gian Benedetto Mittarelli, O.S.B. Cam., [SEP] (2 September 1707 – 4 August 1777) was an Italian monk and monastic historian.    Mittarelli was born in 1707 at Venice and christened Nicola Giacomo.  At the early age of fourteen, Nicola entered the Camaldolese Order at the Monastery of Saint Michael, established on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon. When he was admitted to the novitiate of the monastery, he was given the name Dom Gian Benedetto, by which he was known for the rest of his life. Later, he studied theology and philosophy at the monasteries of his Order in Florence and Rome. When he completed his studies, he was assigned to teach these subjects to the younger members of the Order. Because he was not attuned to the scholastic method, his superiors sent him to the Monastery of Saint Parisius in Treviso, where he became a confessor and the archivist of the Order.    In 1760 he was elected Abbot of San Michele, and in 1765, Superior General of his Order for the space of five years during which he resided in Rome. After his term expired, he returned to his monastery in Venice, where he remained as abbot until his death in 1777.    His monumental work, in the preparation of which he was assisted by his confrères, Dom Anselmo Costadoni and Dom Calogerà, is the ""Annales Camaldulenses ordinis S.

"Tommaso Mocenigo (1343–1423) was doge of Venice from 1414 until his death. [SEP]    He commanded the crusading fleet in the expedition to Nicopolis in 1396 and also won battles against the Genoese during the War of Chioggia of 1378–1381.   While he was Venetian ambassador at Cremona, he was elected doge (1414), and he escaped in secret, fearing that he might be held a prisoner by Gabrino Fondolo, tyrant of that city. He made peace with the Turkish sultan, but, when hostilities broke out afresh, his fleet defeated that of the Turks at the Battle of Gallipoli.   During his reign, the patriarch of Aquileia Louis of Teck formed an anti-Venetian alliance with Emperor Sigismund. Venice, under a double-sided attack, was able to launch an offensive that, in 1419-1420, conquered Udine, Cividale, Feltre, Belluno and most of Friuli from the Aquileian patriarchate. The Cadore also surrendered spontaneously. The ensuing treaty led to a peace with Hungary and the annexation of the patriarchate's lands to the Republic of Venice. Mocenigo greatly encouraged commerce, reconstructed the ducal palace and commenced the library. He died after a long illness in 1423.

"Girolamo Mocetto (c. 1470 in Murano – after 1531 in Venice, Active 1490 – 1530) was an Italian Renaissance painter, engraver, and stained glass designer. [SEP] He was heavily influenced by Domenico Morone, Giovanni Bellini, Bartolomeo Montagna, Cima da Conegliano, and especially Andrea Mantegna. He is most important as an engraver, and his engravings of the compositions of others are his most successful prints.    Mocetto's family were glass painters. His exact date of birth is not known. Although it was long thought that he was born in the 1450s, more recent scholarship has found this to be due to a misread document. The birth date of c. 1470 was arrived at by taking the known dates of his 1494 marriage and his grandfather's 1445 marriage and assuming that Mocetto and his father each married at age 20-25.   He may well be the Hieronymo depentor (""painter Jerome"") who joined the large team under Giovanni Bellini painting the council hall of the Doge's Palace, Venice in 1507, though he had probably been making engravings in a Bellini-esque style for many years before.  In 1517 he painted the facade of a house in Verona; since the owners were also called Mocetto they may have been relatives.  He is last recorded in August 1531, when he signed a will in Venice leaving his estate to his son Domenico.As this summary would indicate, primary sources about Mocetto's life are scant. While there is no record that he trained or lived outside of Venice, there are significant indications that he may have spent time in Mantua. Several impressions of the print Judith with the Head of Holofernes bear Mantuan watermarks, and the print itself closely resembles the work of Giulio Campagnola, who is recorded as being in that city in 1499.    None of Mocetto's works have been dated to before 1490, and the only clearly datable ones are illustrations, with no figures, in a book published in 1514, so little use in establishing a chronology of his style. A total of 17 engravings by his hand are extant, along with 10 paintings, and several stained glass panels.While Mocetto's paintings are ""derivative in form and middling, at best, in quality,"" his engravings are more substantial. They are generally large in size, with several of them being printed from multiple plates, and most appear to be reproductions of paintings, by himself or others. His style varies little: it is ""undisciplined"" and even ""naïve"", marked by a loose and free application of dense cross hatching.  Judith with the Head of Holofernes is his best known print and is based (reversed) on a work by Mantegna known from other copies, probably of the 1490s, with the Venetian-style landscape background only added in a second state, perhaps several years later. In an impression in the British Museum he ""pressed the ink on with a cloth to produce a patterned surface tone"". A group of engravings based on designs by Mantegna and his circle appear to precede a group using his own designs, and finally comes a group copying or reflecting the style of Giovanni Bellini.  There are indications that, unlike other prints by Mantegna's circle after his designs, Mocetto's prints were not produced under the supervision of the master.Of Mocetto's work in stained glass, his c.1515 panels for the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo are considered the most successful.

"Abbe Iacopo Morelli or Jacopo Morelli; Jacobi Morelli; Giacomo Morelli; Abbe Morelli (April 15, 1745 – May 5, 1819) was an Italian ecclesiastic, noted for his antiquarian labors, and one of the most distinguished librarians of modern times. [SEP] Morelli was born at Venice, April 14, 1745. He was the son of poor parents, who were unable to give him a liberal education. It was against their will that he resolved to enter the Church, although in all other respects he always showed the greatest deference to their wishes. He afterwards supplied the deficiencies of his education by private study, and the knowledge which he thus acquired was more substantial and extensive than that of any of his Italian contemporaries, though it was not till late in life that he became acquainted with the Greek and French languages. His love of independence induced him to refuse several very advantageous offers that were made to him both by the Church and by wealthy collectors of books at Venice, and he continued to live as a simple abbe. He formed, however, an intimate friendship with the patrician Farsetti, of whose rich collection of manuscripts. he published a catalogue, under the title of Bibliotheca Manuscritta del bali T.G. Farsetti (Venice, 1771–80, 2 volumes, 12mo). While this work was in course of publication, he also wrote Dissertazione Storica intorno alla Publica Libreria di S. Marco (Venice, 1774), in which he discussed and solved a great many questions connected with the history of literature. He then prepared a similar work on the history of the library of the academy at Padua, whither he had accompanied his friend Farsetti; but the materials which he collected for that purpose were unfortunately left in the hands of Colle, the historiographer of that institution, through whose carelessness they were lost. In 1776 he published a catalogue of the manuscripts of ancient writers which were in the library of the Narni family and somewhat later a catalogue of the manuscripts of Italian works contained in the same library. These works alone would have sufficed to secure to Morelli an honorable place among the eminent bibliographers of modern times; but he acquired a still greater reputation as librarian of the library of St. Mark — an office which he received in 1778, and which he held until his death, which occurred May 5, 1819. In 1795 he discovered a considerable fragment of the 55th book of Dion Cassius, which he published at Bassano, together with new various readings of other books of the same historian. The work which exhibits his extensive knowledge and his critical acumen in the strongest light is his Bibliotheca Manuscripta Graeca et Latina, of which, however, only one volume was published at Bassano (1802), although he had collected materials for several more volumes. His last production was Epistole septens variae eruditionis (Padua, 1819). After his death there appeared Operette ora insieme con Opuscoli di Antichi Scrittori (Venice, 1820, 3 volumes, 8vo).

When in 1616 Morteira escorted the body of the physician Elijah Montalto from France to Amsterdam, the Sephardic Congregation Beth Jaacob (House of  Jacob) in Amsterdam elected him hakham in succession to Moses ben Aroyo.Morteira was the founder of the congregational school Keter Torah, in the highest class of which he taught Talmud and Jewish philosophy. He had also to preach three times a month, and received an annual remuneration of 600 guilders and 100 baskets of turf. Among his most distinguished pupils were Baruch Spinoza, Moses Zacuto and Abraham Cohen Pimentel. Morteira and Isaac da Fonseca Aboab (Manasseh ben Israel was at that time in England) were the members of the mahamad, the political arm of the community, which pronounced on 27 July 1656 the decree of excommunication (""cherem"") against Spinoza.

"Andrea da Murano, also known as Andrea di Giovanni (active 1463 to 1502) was an Italian painter, active mainly in Venice and the Venetian mainland. [SEP]    In 1468, he was given, along with Bartolomeo Vivarini, a commission for painting a canvas for the Scuola di San Marco. In 1472, he is known to have had a studio with his brother, the engraver Girolamo, located in the neighborhood of Santa Maria Formosa. He painted an altarpiece for the church of Santa Maria di Trebaseleghe in Treviso. In 1499, he was living in Castelfranco. In 1502 he painted an altarpiece for the parish church of Mussolente in the province of Vicenza. A triptych depicting Saints Sebastian, Vincent Ferrer, Roch, and four others with St Peter and the Madonna della Misericordia (1475) is attributed to Andrea and found in the Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice, deriving from the church of San Pietro Martire of Murano.

"Giovan Battista Nani (30 August 1616, Venice – 5 November 1678, Venice), in French Jean Baptiste Felix Gaspard Nani,  was a Venetian ambassador, librarian, archivist, amateur botanist and historian, born into a patrician family.For [SEP] 25 years (1643–68) Battista was the Republic of Venice's ambassador to France, as well as making several diplomatic missions into Germany.  He later became Procurator of St Mark's. He wrote a history of the Republic of Venice in his free time, the Historia della Republica Veneta (dal 1613 al 1671), which was translated into French by François Tallemant (1679) and Masclary (1702), and continued by Michele Foscarini and Piero Garzoni.  Nani wrote about the Conspiracy of Spain against the Venetian Republic, set up by the Marquis de Bedmar. The story was used by César Vichard de Saint-Réal in his Conjuration des Espagnols contre la République de Venise en l'année M. DC. XVIII, and in 1682 by Thomas Otway in playwright Venice Preserv'd, or A Plot Discover'd.  Leopold von Ranke published his view on the conspiracy theory in Über die Verschwörung gegen Venedig, im Jahre 1618 (1831).   "
"Bartolomeo della Nave (? – 1636) was a Venetian merchant and art collector. [SEP] Della Nave was born in Venice and acquired a large art collection, that later was spread to prominent collections. Many of the artworks in his collection are known from an inventory dated 1636, which is often also assumed to be his year of death; with others this is uncertain, as they were bought in Venice for Hamilton, but their previous ownership by della Nave is only a strong presumption.  Many of the paintings in his collection are still together today and form a part of the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Their provenance records show ""1636 Slg. Bartolomeo della Nave, Venedig; 1638-1649 Slg. Hamilton; Slg. Leopold Wilhelm"", whereby the intermediary owners are shown to be James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton (d. 1649) and the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria (d. 1662). Most of della Nave's collection was bought for Hamilton (then still a Marquess) in 1636-38; he was one of the great collectors of the period in Britain.  Hamilton's brother-in-law, Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh (as he later became) was English ambassador to Venice, and helped to arrange the purchase. Hamilton, who was a Royalist commander in the English Civil War, was executed in 1649 after losing the Battle of Preston to Oliver Cromwell.  Most of his collection was bought that year by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1647 to 1656.  Many can be seen in the gallery paintings of his collection by David Teniers the Younger, in reduced copies by him, and in Theatrum Pictorium, the printed catalogue of the best Italian paintings, with engravings after the Teniers copies.  At his death in 1662 Archduke Leopold bequeathed his collection to his nephew, the Emperor Leopold I.  The imperial collection of paintings mostly reached the Kunsthistorisches Museum by stages, at a range of dates. One painting that did not reach Vienna was The Death of Actaeon by Titian (National Gallery, London), which the archduke gave to Queen Christina of Sweden about 1656, when she was staying in Antwerp.The collection included many portraits by Titian and others, but none of the sitters have been identified as Della Nave himself.

"Niccolò Barbaro was a Venetian physician, and author of an eyewitness account of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.The [SEP] historian Steven Runciman called him 'the most useful of the Western sources' on the fall of the city in 1453, primarily because of the compelling narrative that follows the events of the siege on a daily basis. However, as a Venetian, Barbaro held strong anti-Genoese beliefs - especially against the Genoese of Pera (modern day Galata), whom he suggests were colluding with the Ottomans during the siege. He also suggests that Giovanni Giustiniani, the Genoese commander stationed at the Mesoteichion (, ""Middle Wall""), the weakest part of the Theodosian Walls, whom Barbaro calls 'Zuan Zustignan', abandoned his post, and that this led to the fall of the city: ""Zuan Zustignan, that Genoese of Genoa, decided to abandon his post, and fled to his ship, which was lying at the boom. The Emperor [Constantine XI] had made this Zuan Zustignan captain of his forces, and as he fled, he went through the city crying 'The Turks have got into the city!' But he lied through his teeth, because the Turks were not yet inside.""However, Leonard of Chios, another eyewitness, says that Giustiniani was injured by an arrow, and attempted to seek out a physician in secret. The Greek historians Doukas and Laonikos Chalkokondyles both also say that Giustiniani was injured too – only Barbaro claims that the Genoese commander fled in such a way.Serious as these criticisms are, Barbaro's account has presented a solid chronological narrative that presents the events of the Siege of Constantinople day-by-day.

"Pietro Ottoboni (2 July 1667 – 29 February 1740) was an Italian cardinal and grandnephew of Pope Alexander VIII, who was also born Pietro Ottoboni. [SEP] He is remembered especially as a great patron of music and art. Ottoboni was the last person to hold the curial office of Cardinal-nephew, which was abolished by Alexander's successor, Pope Innocent XII, in 1692. Ottoboni '""loved pomp, prodigality, and sensual pleasure, but was in the same time kind, ready to serve and charitable"".    Pietro was born in Venice to the noble Ottoboni family, whose most prominent member had been his granduncle Pope Alexander VIII (1689–1691). The family bought their way into Venetian nobility in the 17th century. He received the clerical tonsure and minor orders on 20 October 1689 and was created cardinal deacon in the consistory of 7 November 1689, receiving the red hat on 14 November. He was superintendent general of the affairs of the Apostolic See and governor of the cities of Fermo and Tivoli, as well as of the territory of Capranica. He held the office of vice-chancellor of the Holy Roman Church from 14 November 1689 until 29 February 1740. He became cardinal-bishop of Sabina in 1725, cardinal-bishop of Frascati in 1730, cardinal-bishop of Porto and Santa Rufina in 1734, and vice-dean then dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals on 3 September 1738. Ottoboni was also archpriest of the patriarchal Liberian Basilica, secretary of the Roman Inquisition, Archpriest of the patriarchal Lateran Basilica (from 1730), and Grand prior of Ireland.     Ottoboni was one of the great patrons of his generation. He resided in the Palazzo della Cancelleria, where he had begun to construct a theatre in 1689. The favourite of Cardinal Ottoboni, Andrea Adami, a castrato, was appointed master of the papal choir in the Sistine Chapel. Between 1709 and 1710 Filippo Juvarra entered the court and enlarged the theatre. Domenico Paradisi and Angelo de Rossi were responsible for decoration of the palace suites. Ottoboni supported Arcangelo Corelli, the finest violinist of his generation, at his Monday night concerts called ""academies"". Through these concerts, Corelli was introduced to Handel. When Corelli died in 1713, he left his estate, which included some valuable pictures, to the Cardinal, who distributed the sizable funds among Corelli's relations and erected a princely tomb for the musician in the Pantheon. Other protégés of the cardinal were Alessandro Scarlatti, Antonio Vivaldi and Antonio Caldara. As his father Antonio Ottoboni also did, Pietro Ottoboni wrote texts of cantatas and librettos for oratorios, such as for Scarlatti's La Giuditta of 1693. When opera was banned in Rome, performances withdrew to Ottoboni's Cancelleria. His triumphal return to Venice in 1726 was celebrated with musical festivities that included a serenata Andromeda liberata, with arias contributed by various Venetian masters, including Vivaldi. The young Sicilian architect Giovanni Battista Vaccarini and painters Sebastiano Conca, Sebastiano Ricci and Francesco Trevisani, a resident of the court for almost four decades, also benefited from his patronage. One of his most important commissions was the Seven Sacraments executed in 1712 by Giuseppe Maria Crespi (now in the Museum of Dresden). In 1735 he donated his Roman sculptures and other antiquities to the Capitoline Museums. The last decade of Ottobini's life was his most active as a patron. Upon the death of Pope Clement XII on 6 February 1740, Ottoboni was considered papabile, but left the conclave with a fever. He died three days later. His heirs took advantage of the vacant papacy and removed everything portable from the Cancelleria. There is a full description of the cardinal's paintings, which locates them by room. It presents a clear picture of his extensive acquisitions over a period of fifty years. Listed are almost 530 paintings, some inherited from his great-uncle: the most important painters are mentioned above. Others were Benedetto Luti, Guido Reni, Giovanni Batista Gaulli, Tintoretto, Pusini, Giuseppe Chiari, Pietro da Cortona, Francesco Albani, Jacopo Bassano, Giovanni Baglione, Giacinto Brandi, Giuseppe Cesari, and Veronese. In Rome Ottoboni had acquired a taste for Northern European paintings like those by Caspar van Wittel and Gerrit van Honthorst. The Ottoboni possessions were disposed of in four sales, and as a result dispersed throughout the world. Final settlements of all accounts were made in 1752. According to Charles Montesquieu Pietro Ottoboni had between 60 and 70 children. Portraits of his mistresses as saints, like Margarita Pio Zeno of Savoy (1670-1725), decorated his bedroom.     Despite his numerous benefices, and his alliance with the French crown, the expenses of the cardinal were perpetually exceeding his income. Upon his death, his estate was subsequently liquidated to settle his debts. Ottoboni's music library was dispersed after his death, but the so-called ""Manchester Concerto Part-books"" have survived with sets of separate parts for 95 compositions, mostly concertos. His manuscript scores came into the possession of Charles Jennens, the librettist for Handel’s Messiah. The diverse contents of the concerto collection suggest that Ottoboni’s musicians acquired and performed music from artistic centres elsewhere (notably Venice and Bologna) as well as works composed in Rome. Ottoboni was a gifted opera and oratorio librettist and a member of the Academy of Arcadia. Pietro Metastasio, was his godchild.     Codices Ottoboniani in the Vatican Library   "
"Iacopo Negretti (1548/50 – 14 October 1628), best known as Jacopo or Giacomo Palma il Giovane or simply Palma Giovane (""Young Palma""),  was an Italian painter from Venice and a notable exponent of the Venetian school. [SEP] After Tintoretto's death (1594), Palma became Venice's dominant artist perpetuating his style. Outside Venice, he received numerous commissions in the area of Bergamo, then part of the Venetian Domini di Terraferma, and in Central Europe, most prominently from the connoisseur emperor Rudolph II in Prague.    Palma was born in Venice. Born into a family of painters, he was the great-nephew of the painter Palma Vecchio (""Old Palma"") and the son of Antonio Nigreti (1510/15-1575/85), a minor painter who was himself the pupil of the elder Palma's workshop foreman Bonifacio de' Pitati  and who after Bonifazio's death (1553) inherited Bonifacio's shop and clientele; the younger Palma seems to have polished his style making copies after Titian. In 1567 Guidobaldo II della Rovere, duke of Urbino, recognized Palma's talents, supporting him for four years and sending him to Rome, where he remained until about 1572. Shedding most remnants of Roman manner after his return to Venice, Palma adopted the inescapable models and mannerisms of Tintoretto. His early biographers assert that he found a place in the ageing Titian's workshop; when the master died, Palma stepped in to finish his last work, the Pietà in the Accademia, Venice. Palma's first major public commission arrived after a 1577 fire in the Doge's Palace: three scenes in its grand council hall. By the mid-1580s he had digested Tintoretto's versatile figure postures and Titian's thick surfaces, emphasis on light, and loose brushstroke. In Palma Giovane's output, Freedberg detects also ""an occasional discursive opulence à la Veronese; and inclinations towards descriptive naturalism à la Bassano.""Rejecting Mannerism in the 1580s, he embraced a reformist naturalism he varied the ingeniously synthesised amalgam according to subject matter and patrons' own eclectic and conservative tastes, with ""virtuoso skill and a facile intelligence.""  He worked alongside Veronese and Tintoretto on the decorations in the Doge's Palace where he came to know fully the Venetian tradition. From 1580-90 he painted cycles of large canvases either for Venetian Schools or sacred buildings (the sacristies of San Giacomo dall'Orio and of the Jesuit church (Gesuiti, the Scuola di San Giovanni Evangelista, and the Oratorio dei Crociferi. Thanks to the intelligent way they quoted from Tintoretto and their own narrative drive, these are Palma the Younger's best works. After this he went back to official commissions at the Doge's Palace.  Among these there is the magnificent portrait of Saint Pope Pius V, commissioned by the Bellanti Counts, an influential family who gave four ""Capitani del Popolo"" to the city of Siena in the Middle Ages. After three centuries in Tuscany, it was bought by Sir Robert Dick in 1842. After another two hundred years, the portrait was bought from Bonham's in London, one of the most ancient auction houses in the world, founded in 1793 and thanks to Roberto Gagliardi it was brought back to Tuscany where it can be admired at the Chianciano Museum of Art, a few kilometres from Siena.Palma il Giovane went on to organize his own, large studio which he used to produce a repetitive series of religious and allegorical pictures that can be found throughout the territory of the Venetian Republic. After 1600 he painted mythologies for a small circle of intellectuals. After the death of Tintoretto in 1594, he remained one of the leading painters in the City of Venice. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges. Among his followers was the Brescian painter, Camillo Rama.   "
"David Pardo was an 18th-century Italian rabbi and liturgical poet who lived for some time in Sarajevo, Bosnia and in Jerusalem.

He was the son of Jacob Pardo of Ragusa, rabbi of Venice. After finishing his studies, Pardo left Venice and went to Ragusa. He then lived for some years in Sarajevo, where he devoted himself to teaching. From Sarajevo he went to Spalato, Dalmatia, where Rabbi Abraham David Papo engaged him as teacher at the yeshivah. After the death of Papo's successor, Isaac Tzedakah, Pardo was elected chief rabbi of the city. Among his disciples were Shabbethai Ventura, David Pinto, and Abraham Curiel. In 1752 Pardo began to publish, his first work being Shoshannim le-David (Venice, 1752), a commentary on the Mishnah.In 1764 Pardo accepted the position of chief rabbi at Sarajevo, where he succeeded Joshua Isaac Maggioro. He employed his leisure time in writing and publishing various works. Toward the end of his life he went to Jerusalem, where he died.Besides the above-mentioned works, Pardo wrote the following works: Miktam le-David (Salonica, 1769), responsa; Chasde David (part i., Leghorn, 1776; part ii., ib. 1790), commentary on the Tosefta; Chukkat ha-Pesach (Leghorn, 1796), a ritual for the Passover season; La-Menatzeach le-David (Salonica, 1795), novellae on various Talmudic topics.

"Pope Paul II (Latin: Paulus II; 23 February 1417 – 26 July 1471), born Pietro Barbo, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States  from 30 August 1464 to his death in 1471. [SEP] When his maternal uncle Eugene IV became pope, Barbo switched from training to be a merchant to religious studies. His rise in the Church was relatively rapid. Elected pope in 1464, Paul amassed a great collection of art and antiquities.    Pietro Barbo was born in Venice, the son of Niccolo and Polixena Condulmer Barbo. His mother was the sister of Pope Eugenius IV (1431–1447). Through his father he was a member of the noble Barbo family. His adoption of the spiritual career, after having been trained as a merchant, was prompted by his uncle's election as pope. His consequent promotion was rapid. He became Archdeacon of Bologna, and Bishop of Cervia and of Vicenza, and in 1440 became a cardinal-deacon. Barbo gained popularity through his generosity. He boasted that if elected pope he would buy each cardinal a villa to escape the summer heat.After having been lay abbot of Santa Maria in Sylvis since 1441, in 1445 he succeeded Giuliano Cesarini as archpriest of the Vatican Basilica. Barbo was very influential under Eugene IV, Nicholas V, and Calixtus III, but less so under Pius II. Barbo had a marked propensity to enjoy dressing up in sumptuous ecclesiastical finery.     Barbo was elected to succeed Pope Pius II by the accessus in the first ballot of the papal conclave of 30 August 1464 with a majority of fourteen of the nineteen cardinals present. He owed his election in part to the dissatisfaction of some of the cardinals with the policy of his predecessor.Upon taking office, Paul II was to convene an ecumenical council within three years. But these terms of subscription were modified by Paul II at his own discretion, and this action lost him the confidence of the College of Cardinals. The justification for setting aside the capitulations, seen to be under way by the Duke of Milan's ambassador as early as 21 September, lay in connecting any abridgement of the Pope's absolute monarchy in the Papal States with a consequent abridgement of his sole authority in spiritual matters. Almost from his coronation, Paul withdrew and became inaccessible: audiences were only granted at night and even good friends waited a fortnight to see him. His suspiciousness was widely attested. Paul wore rouge in public. The story of Cardinal Ammanati that he meant to take the name Formosus II (meaning ""handsome""), after Pope Formosus, but was persuaded not to, is more often repeated than the story that he was dissuaded from Marcus, being Venetian and the Cardinal of San Marco, because it was also the war-cry of Venice. He had a papal tiara made for his own use studded with ""diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, topaz, large pearls, and every kind of precious gem"". He built the Palazzo San Marco (now the Palazzo Venezia) and lived there even as pope, amassing a great collection of art and antiquities.    A sore point was his abuse of the practice of creating cardinals in pectore, without publishing their names. Eager to raise new cardinals to increase the number who were devoted to his interests, but restricted by the terms of the capitulation, which gave the college a voice in the creation of new members, in the winter of 1464–65 Paul created two secret cardinals both of whom died before their names could be published. In his fourth year as Pope, he created eight new cardinals on 18 September 1467. Five were candidates pressed by kings, placating respectively James II of Cyprus, Edward IV of England, Louis XI of France, Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and Ferdinand I of Naples; one was the able administrator of the Franciscans; and the last two elevated his old tutor and a first cardinal-nephew. Two further cardinal-nephews were added on 21 November 1468. In a sign of his increasing secretiveness and paranoia, he added two more cardinals secretly at the same consistory, and four more at the beginning of 1471, expecting to reveal them only in his testament. Tensions came to the fore when in attempting to eliminate redundant offices, Paul II proceeded to annul the College of Abbreviators, whose function it was to formulate papal documents; a storm of indignation arose, inasmuch as rhetoricians and poets with humanist training, had long been accustomed to benefiting from employment in such positions. Paul proceeded as well against the Roman Academy. Bartolomeo Platina was a member of both and found his papal employment abruptly curtailed. He wrote a pamphlet insolently demanding the pope recall his restrictions, and was imprisoned in the winter of 1464, but released four months later. In February 1468, when Rome was rife with political intrigue fomented by the Roman barons and the neighboring princes, Paul II arrested Platina and other members of the Academy on charges of irreligion, immorality, and an alleged conspiracy to assassinate the Pope. The prisoners were interrogated under torture and eventually released.After his release on 7 July 1469, Platina expected to be again in the employ of Paul II, who, however, declined his services. Platina threatened vengeance and executed his threat, when at the suggestion of Pope Sixtus IV he later wrote his Vitæ Pontificum Platinæ historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX (1479). Not unaccountably, Platina set forth an unfavorable delineation of the character of Paul II. Among other things, Platina reported that Pius II suggested Barbo should have been called Maria Pietissima, as ""when he could not obtain what he aimed at by praying, entreating, and requesting, he would join tears to his petitions to make them the sooner believed."" Some historians have suggested the nickname may also have been a possible allusion to a perceived lack of masculinity, reflecting possible homosexuality. Platina also paints his enemy as cruel, and an archenemy of science. For centuries it influenced historical opinions until critical research proved otherwise. Though Platina's writing after the conflict would tarnish the legacy of Paul II, the conflict would prove to have a greater effect on the intellectual environment of Rome. Peter Partner explains, ""Probably its most important result was to convince men of letters that cultural conformity would be enforced in Rome."" More tangibly, after the crackdown of Paul II, the Roman Academy took on a more religious flavour, turning in part to theology as a means of legitimizing its pursuits.    Pope Paul rejected George of Poděbrady (King George of Bohemia) because he upheld the conventions of the Council of Basel in favour of the Utraquists. In August 1465, Paul II summoned George before the Roman tribunal. When the King failed to come, Paul allied himself with the insurgents in Bohemia and released the King's subjects from their oath of allegiance. In December 1466, he pronounced the ban of excommunication and sentence of deposition against George. George's apologist, Gregory of Heimberg, subsequently accused Paul of immorality, a move that resulted in Gregory's own excommunication. Just when the King's goodwill disposed the Pope in favor of reconciliation, Paul died suddenly of a heart attack on 26 July 1471. Reports of the death varied. Some claimed he had collapsed from severe indigestion after eating melon in excess. Some (mainly the pontiff's critics) said that he had died whilst being sodomized by a page boy. Nevertheless, his death resulted in the creation of a power vacuum in Central Europe – especially after Poděbrady himself died in March of that same year.    Although Paul II was a committed opponent of humanist learning, he oversaw and approved the introduction of printing into the Papal States, first at Subiaco in 1464 by Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim, and at Rome itself in 1467. The result was that books and other documents became far more numerous and less expensive to procure than the previous handwritten manuscripts. Printing put the materials needed for an advanced education into the hands of more people than ever before, including an increasing number of laypeople. The output of printing presses at this period was, as a matter of course, subject to governmental scrutiny; during Paul II's reign, books produced in the Papal States were largely limited to Latin classical literature and ecclesiastical texts. The chronicler Stefano Infessura's republican and anti-papal temper makes his diary a far from neutral though well-informed witness. But it is certain that although Paul II opposed the humanists, he yet provided for popular amusements: in 1466 he permitted the horse-race that was a feature of Carnival to be run along the main street, the Via Lata, which now became known from this annual event as the Via del Corso. So that nobody felt left out of the event, the Pope instituted races for boys, adult men, old people and Jews, with appropriate prizes for each group. He tried as Pope to reduce or stop blood feuds and vendettas in Italy, and to make sure that Jews were treated fairly. Paul II displayed an extravagant love of personal splendor that gratified his sense of self-importance. After his death Sixtus IV and a selected group of cardinals inspected the treasure laid up against expenditures against the Turks: they found 54 silver shells filled with pearls, to a value of 300,000 ducats, jewels and gold intended for refashioning, worth another 300,000 ducats, and a magnificent diamond worth 7,000 ducats, which was sent to Cardinal d'Estouteville to cover monies he had advanced to the pontiff. The coin was not immediately found. He had also amassed a collection of 800 gemstones.William Francis Barry considers that his character was ""misunderstood by the Italian courts which never dreamt that a Pope could be an honourable man"".In statecraft, Paul II lacked eminence and achieved nothing of consequence for Italy. In his own domain, however, he terminated, in 1465, the regime of the counts of Anguillara.    Cardinals created by Paul II   "

"Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (also called Giambattista Piazzetta or Giambattista Valentino Piazzetta) (February 13, 1682 or 1683 – April 28, 1754) was an Italian Rococo painter of religious subjects and genre scenes. [SEP]    Piazzetta was born in Venice, the son of a sculptor Giacomo Piazzetta, from whom he had early training in wood carving. Starting in 1697 he studied with the painter Antonio Molinari. By Piazzetta's account, he studied under Giuseppe Maria Crespi while living in Bologna in 1703–05, although there is no record by Crespi of formal tutelage. Thanks to Crespi, Carlo Cignani's influence reached Piazzetta. Piazzetta did find inspiration in Crespi's art, in which the chiaroscuro of Caravaggio was transformed into an idiom of graceful charm in his pictures of common folk.  He was also greatly impressed by the altarpieces created by another Bolognese painter of a half-century earlier, Guercino. Around 1710, he returned to Venice.  There he won recognition as a leading artist despite his limited output and his unassuming nature, but he ultimately was less patronized, both in Venice and especially abroad, than two other eminent stars in Venetian late-Baroque/Rococo, Ricci and Tiepolo. yet Piazzeta's range of topics was broader than that of these artists; Tiepolo, for example, never painted genre paintings and restricted himself to grand history and religious altarpieces. Ricci and Tiepolo had a luminous palette and facile ease that allowed them to carpet meters of ceiling with frescoes, although with a superficiality and glamor that is absent from Piazzetta's darker and more intimate depictions. Nonetheless, Tiepolo, who collaborated with Piazzetta on some projects, was greatly influenced by the older artist; in turn, the luminosity and brilliance of Tiepolo's palette influenced Piazzetta in his later years.  Piazzetta created an art of warm, rich color and a mysterious poetry.  He often depicted peasantry, even if often in a grand fashion. He was highly original in the intensity of color he sometimes used in his shadows, and in the otherworldly quality he gave to the light which throws part of a composition into relief. The gestures and glances of his protagonists hint at unseen dramas, as in one of his best-known paintings, The Soothsayer (1740, now in Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice). He brought similar elusiveness to works of a religious nature, such as the Sotto in su Glory of St. Dominic in the Church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo. Also notable are his many carefully rendered drawings of half-length figures or groups of heads. Usually in charcoal or black chalk with white heightening on gray paper, these are filled with the same spirit that animates his paintings, and were purchased by collectors as independent works. He also produced engravings. In 1750 Piazzetta became the first director of the newly founded Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, and he devoted the last few years of his life to teaching. He was elected a member of the Bolognese Accademia Clementina in 1727. Among the painters in his studio were Domenico Maggiotto, Francesco Dagiu (il Capella), Johann Heinrich Tischbein, Egidio Dall'Oglio, and Antonio Marinetti. The engraver Marco Pitteri was affiliated with his studio, and engraved many of his works. Among younger painters who emulated his style are Giovanni Battista Pissati,. Giulia Lama, Federico Bencovich, and Francesco Polazzo (1683–1753). He died in Venice on April 28, 1754.   "
"Vettor Pisani (1324 – 13 August 1380) was a Venetian admiral. [SEP] He was in command of the Venetian fleet in 1378 during the war against the Genoese, whom he defeated off Capo d'Anzio; subsequently he recaptured Cattaro, Sebenico and Arbe, which had been seized by the Hungarians, the allies of the Genoese. But the Genoese fleet completely defeated Pisani at Pola in May 1379, and on his return to Venice he was thrown into prison. The Genoese then pressed home their victory, and besieged and captured Chioggia, whereby Venice itself was in danger. The people thereupon demanded the liberation of Pisani, in whose skill they had the fullest confidence.The government gave way and appointed the aged commander admiral of the fleet once more. Through his able strategy and daring he recaptured Chioggia, defeated the Genoese and threatened Genoa itself until that republic agreed to peace terms.Pisani died in 1380 while on his way to Manfredonia with a squadron to ship provisions. He is buried in Basilica of San Giovanni e Paolo, Venice.Several ships have borne his name, including Vettor Pisani, an armored cruiser built in the 1890s and the submarine Vettor Pisani, which operated during World War II.  His statue is No.14 on Prato della valle Padua. The home of Vettor Pisani is supposed to be the building in which now is the Hotel Saturnia.   "

"Polissena Contarini Da Mula, or Polixena Polixena di Giulio Contarini Da Mula, was a Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Alvise Giovanni Mocenigo (r. 1763-1779). She married the Doge in 1771 at a very young age, though she does not seem to have played to part of dogaressa in a ceremonial sense as much as did her predecessor Pisana Conaro. [SEP] She was, however, the center of the literary circle her consort gathered on his private country villa, where she became the object and muse of many poets. There, Carlo Gozzi prepared comic plays for the little theatre of the Palace.   "
"Antonio da Ponte (1512–1597) was a Venetian architect and engineer, most famous for his rebuilding of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. [SEP] Antonio Da Ponte was head architect of the rebuilding of the Ducal Palace that was badly damaged by fire in 1574. After the original wooden structure of the Rialto Bridge had collapsed repeatedly, it was decided that a stone bridge was necessary. Between 1588 and 1591 da Ponte rebuilt the Rialto Bridge  to a design to which he had contributed.The design was selected in a contest held by the local authorities under Doge of Venice Pasquale Cicogna. Though Da Ponte is relatively unknown otherwise, the design for the Venice landmark defeated submissions by noted architects of the time, including Michelangelo. Plans were offered by famous architects such as Jacopo Sansovino, Andrea Palladio and Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, but all involved a Classical approach with several arches, which was judged inappropriate to the situation.The engineering of the bridge throws considerable weight on its foundations.  It was considered so audacious that architect Vincenzo Scamozzi predicted future ruin. However the bridge has defied its critics to become one of the architectural icons of Venice.In the construction of this work Antonio was helped by his nephew Antonio Contino, who would also later design the famous Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri). In 1841, the Parisian architect Antoine Rondelet wrote about the suspicious similarities between Antonio da Ponte's project and the one by Vincenzo Scamozzi.   "

"Matteo Ponzone (17th century) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active between 1630 and 1700 mainly in Venice. [SEP] He was a pupil of Santo Peranda. Several of his works are in the churches and public buildings of Venice, particularly in San Giorgio Maggiore, and in the church of the ""Padri Croceferi"".     According to several sources, Ponzone was born in Venice, identified as «Mathi et Simon fiol de noble Patron Claudio Bolzon et Agnesina Negro equal in Madonna» born in the parish of Saint Moses November 9, 1583. Some other sources reported his date of birth approximately in 1586 in Rab, in the far north of Dalmatia, that time owned by Republic of Venice. Matteo Ponzone operated mainly in Venice, unless an interim period of ten years spent in Dalmatia, leaving their works in various locations of the coast.Ponzone was young student of Jacopo Palma the Younger, and was related to the painter Sante Peranda, who was probably one of his teachers and whose influence is evident in the work of Ponzone. He joined the Fraglia dei Pittori of Venice from 1613 to 1633, being one of the busiest in town throughout this period. In his workshop he had as pupils Antonio Zanchi, Andrea Celesti, Pietro Negri, and Giovanni Carboncino, who assist him in various paintings orders of the last Venetian period. The large amount of work left in situ adequately define the importance for the history of Venetian painting of the first '600, although the significance was detected only in recent years. Similarly, the caliber of orders received -those of particular importance include works in the churches of San Giorgio Maggiore, Madonna dell'Orto, and San Cassiano - account for the great success and wide contribution  of Ponzone to Venetian artistic history.

"Lorenzo Priuli (1537–1600) was a Roman Catholic cardinal and Patriarch of Venice. [SEP]  Like many Venetian patriarchs, he was a lay member of the Venetian Senate, who was only ordained in 1590, at the age of 54, after he won the Senate's election to fill the patriarchy. Previously he had been a successful Venetian diplomat and governor.In the last centuries of the Republic of Venice (to 1797), exceptionally among Catholic bishops, the patriarch was elected by the Venetian Senate, who  always chose a member of one of the hereditary patrician families of the city, and usually a layman who was only ordained to take up the patriarchate.  The papacy obliged them to pass an examination in theology, though many evaded this.  Usually the new patriarch was a Venetian diplomat or administrator, as with Lorenzo Priuli in 1591 or Francesco Vendramin in 1608, though some were career clerics, who had usually been previously in positions in Rome, like Federico Cornaro in 1631.    He came from a senatorial family, and made his career as a successful Venetian diplomat, serving as ambassador to Spain, France, and the Holy See.  On 25 Jan 1591, he was consecrated bishop by Marcello Acquaviva, Archbishop of Otranto. While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of Johann Walser, Titular Bishop of Belline and Auxiliary Bishop of Brixen (1592); and the principal co-consecrator of Ferdinando D'Avila, Bishop of Rethymo (1592).

"Angelo Maria Querini or Quirini (30 March 1680 – 6 January 1755) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. [SEP]    Born in Venice, he entered the Benedictine Order in Florence in 1695 and was ordained in 1702. From 1710 to 1714, he undertook extended educational journeys through England, France, Germany, and the Netherlands and corresponded or even met with eminent scholars of his time such as Bernard de Montfaucon, Isaac Newton, or Voltaire. Upon his return to Italy, he was made abbot of the Benedictine monastery in Rome and charged with compiling the annals of the order. In 1723, he was elected Archbishop of Corfu. Pope Benedict XIII created him Cardinal in pectore in 1726; he was installed as Cardinal and bishop of Brescia a year later. In 1730, he became the head librarian of the Vatican Library. 1747/48 he again went on a journey through Switzerland and Bavaria. In these years, he also became a member of the Academies of Sciences of Berlin, Vienna, and Russia, and was member of the first learned society of Habsburg Monarchy, the Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis. He had increasing differences with Pope Benedict XIV, though, such as over the assignment of Cardinal Passionei as pro-librarian and the pope's position in a conflict with Venice. Ultimately, these differences aggravated and led to his being sent back to his diocese in Brescia, where he died a few years later. Quirini's writings include many works on the history of the Church, of Corfu, and of Brescia, as well as a five-volume edition of the correspondence of Cardinal Reginald Pole. In Brescia, he founded in 1745 the Biblioteca Queriniana, which still exists today, and he sponsored the German missions. He also financed the completion of the St. Hedwig Church in Berlin, which is today the cathedral of the archbishopric of Berlin.   "

"Jacopo Francesco Riccati (28 May 1676 – 15 April 1754) was a Venetian mathematician and jurist from Venice. [SEP] He is best known for having studied the equation which bears his name.    Riccati was educated first at the Jesuit school for the nobility in Brescia, and in 1693 he entered the University of Padua to study law. He received a doctorate in law (LL.D.) in 1696. Encouraged by Stefano degli Angeli to pursue mathematics, he studied mathematical analysis.     Riccati received various academic offers, but declined them in order to devote his full attention to the study of mathematical analysis on his own. Peter the Great invited him to Russia as president of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. He was also invited to Vienna as an imperial councilor and was offered a professorship at the University of Padua. He declined all these offers. He was often consulted by the Senate of Venice on the construction of canals and dikes along rivers. Some of his work on multinomials was included by Maria Gaetana Agnesi, at Riccati's request, in the book on integral calculus of her Analytical Institutions.The Riccati equation is named after him.    His father, Conte Montino Riccati, came from a noble family who owned land near Venice. His mother was from the powerful Colonna family. His father died in 1686, when Riccati was only ten, leaving the youth a handsome estate. Jacopo's son, Vincenzo Riccati, a Jesuit, followed his father's footsteps and pioneered the development of hyperbolic functions. A second son, Giordano Riccati was the first to measure the ratio of Young's moduli of metals—preceding the better known Thomas Young by 25 years.    Jacopo Riccati was named honorary Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1723.      "
"Giovanni Battista Riccio (Giambattista Riccio) (late 16th century – after 1621) was a musician and composer of the early Baroque era, resident in Venice, most notable for his development of instrumental forms, particularly utilizing the recorder. [SEP]    No details are available regarding the early part of his life, but he must have been born in the late sixteenth century. Records show that he was appointed as organist at the Scuola di San Giovanni Evangelista, Venice, in 1609, when he was the preferred choice over Gabriel Sponga (a nephew of Francesco Usper). He was probably also a violinist.Riccio is known to have published three books of vocal and instrumental music in Venice. These books include his instrumental works for recorder—unusual for Venetian music at the time, although Giovanni Picchi also wrote for the instrument. The initial publication date of Riccio's Primo Libro is unknown, but the reprint dating from 1612 survives. The majority of the first book is allotted to vocal works, but in the revised edition two new instrumental canzonas are appended. One is his first known piece for recorder—a canzone for two flautini. His Secondo Libro, also published in Venice, appeared in 1614. His Terzo libro delle Divine Lodi published in 1620 and 1621 is the most widely known today. It comprises thirty-six vocal works and a further twelve instrumental pieces mostly described as canzonas. Most feature two main instruments (such as recorder, cornetto, violin, trombone or sometimes contemporary bassoon or dulcian). One canzona entitled La Grimantea con il tremolo is one of the first pieces to make use of the tremolo technique for the 'Flautin e Fagoto' (recorder and bassoon).Dedications in his works suggest Riccio knew other composers such as Giovanni Picchi, Alessandro Grandi, Giovanni Battista Grillo and Giacomo Finetti. Some of his canzonas quote from larger-scale works by Giovanni Gabrieli.   "

"Giovanni Rovetta (c. 1595/97–1668) was an Italian Baroque composer and maestro di capella of the Capella Marciana at St Mark's Basilica, Venice between Monteverdi and Cavalli.He [SEP] may have been a choirboy at St. Mark's, where his father played: the earliest document is of his admission in December 1614 as a permanent member of the capella and he remained at S. Marco for the rest of his career. He was a chorister, instrumentalist, bass, and vice-director under Monteverdi, and finally served as Monteverdi's successor from 1664 until his death. He was also the director of the Ospedale dei Derelitti (Ospedaletto) between 1635 and 1647. His students included his nephew Giovanni Battista Volpe (known as Rovettino) and the Venetian composer Giovanni Legrenzi. His compositions include several volumes of madrigals and a great deal of sacred music, especially masses, psalms, and motets. His style reflects Monteverdi's influence, although certain pieces show a distinct and individual talent for melody. A ceremonial mass, dating from 1639, counts among his most successful works. He also wrote collections of instrumental music (Canzoni per sonare). He composed one opera, Ercole in Lidia (1645, Teatro Novissimo, Venice, now lost) and withdrew from another project, Argiope (1649).   "
"Giovanni Maria Ruggieri or Ruggeri was a Baroque composer from Italy. [SEP] His dates of birth and death are uncertain, but he may have been born about 1665 in Verona and died around 1725. He is known to have flourished from 1689–1720.    His major works were apparently composed in Venice. His first work, La Clotilde, is extant, and on its title page he described himself as an amateur; the librettist for the same work described him as being distinguished among amateurs and the peer of the most celebrated scholars of music. Other than these fragments, very little is known about his personal life. Archives in the Museo Correr in Venice indicate that he owned several properties and he may have been in the service of the noble Contarini family, to whom he wrote a letter in 1695. His early musical career comprises four collections of trio sonatas, both da camera and da chiesa, published at some time between 1689 and 1697, but these have since been lost. His surviving sonatas display considerable invention and ability with counterpoint. In 1696 Ruggieri began working full-time as a composer and presumably encountered considerable success, because his operas were often revived: Armida abbandonata was produced at least five times between 1707 and 1715. His Elisa (1711) was regarded by critics as a success, and it was the first ever opera buffa to be produced in the Republic of Venice. As a composer of sacred music, he is an important influence on Vivaldi, who would later borrow extensively from Ruggieri's Gloria in D for his own two Glorias. Vivaldi is also said to have revised a work by Ruggieri (L'inganno trionfante in amore); this may well be, but there is no documentary proof of it.

"Carlo Ruzzini (11 November 1653 – 5 January 1735) was a Venetian diplomat, statesman, and Doge. [SEP]    Ruzzini was born in Venice, the eldest child of wealthy parents, Marco Ruzzini and Caterina Zeno. By the end of the 17th century the Republic of Venice was losing ground in its constant diplomatic and military struggle with the Turkish Empire, so there was great need for diplomats such as Carlo Ruzzini who had both the education and the requisite personal fortune to qualify for the diplomatic service. Starting his career of public service at 26 running the Venetian Arsenal and dockyard, Carlo Ruzzini became a diplomat and was sent as Ambassador to Madrid in 1691. As the ambassador to Vienna, in July 1698 he was organizing the visit of the Russian Tsar Peter the Great to Venice, but that tour was failed because of the Streltsy revolt in Moscow. Later Ruzzini represented Venice during the negotiations at Carlowitz (1698-1699), managing to obtain some advantages for his country. His indecision and fear of making the wrong decision - partly due to his brief and the need to constantly consult the Venetian Council - caused much irritation with the other participants who, therefore, contrived to exclude Venice and him from the more important decisions. This episode however did not stunt his career, as is demonstrated later by his appointment first as Venetian Ambassador in the Hague (1706), to the Turkish Court (1707) and in Vienna. He was Venice's Ambassador Extraordinary at other important international negotiations such as at Utrecht in 1712. However, Venice's decline and the fact that its power was now largely restricted to within the Italian border meant that his part was a minor one. At the conclusion of the last of the wars between Venice and Turkey (1714–1718), Ruzzini represented the Republic during the peace negotiations at Passarowitz in July 1718. The inherent weakness in Venice's strategic position meant that little was gained and much lost in the negotiations. After the Treaty of Passarowitz Ruzzini continued his diplomatic career with a second posting to Constantinople before ill health forced him home. However, his wide experience meant he continued to play an important part in the political life of the Republic. He was a candidate for Doge in 1722 but was beaten by Alvise III Sebastiano Mocenigo. Ten years later, on 6 June 1732, on Mocenigo's death, Ruzzini was easily elected with 40 votes out of 41. During his brief reign he achieved little of note but kept Venice neutral and out of further conflicts.   "

"Marco Sanudo (c. 1153 – between 1220 and 1230, most probably 1227) was the creator and first Duke of the Duchy of the Archipelago, after the Fourth Crusade. [SEP] Maternal nephew of Venetian doge Enrico Dandolo, he was a participant in the Fourth Crusade (1204). He was part of the negotiations when the Republic of Venice bought the island of Crete from Boniface of Montferrat. Between 1205 and 1207, or a little after 1213-1214 according to sources, he gathered a fleet and captured the island of Naxos, laying the foundations of the Duchy of the Archipelago. He built a new capital city on the island, Kastro (now the main port). During his reign, he blended the Byzantine and occidental organizations. He became Vassal of the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders around 1210 or 1216. For his lord, he fought against the Empire of Nicaea. But for Venice, he took part in the Cretan expedition of 1211.   "
"Marin Sanudo, italianised as Marino Sanuto or Sanuto the Younger (May 22, 1466 – 1536), was a Venetian historian and diarist. [SEP] His most significant work is his Diarii, which he had intended to write up into a history of Venice.       He was the son of the senator Leonardo Sanuto, into a patrician family of Venice. Left an orphan at the age of eight, he lost his fortune owing to the bad management of his elder brother, who eventually left the family for Syria. Thus, Sanuto was for many years hampered by want of means. He spent the rest of his childhood under the protection of his uncle, Francesco Sanuto, who may have also supported him financially.Sanuto began writing early. Aged fifteen, he wrote the Memorabilia Deorum Dearumque, on the antique gods and goddesses. In 1483 he accompanied his cousin Mario, who was one of the three sindici inquisitori deputed to hear appeals from the decisions of the rettori, on a tour through Istria and the mainland provinces, and he wrote a minute account of his experiences in his diary. Wherever he went he sought out learned men, examined libraries, and copied inscriptions. The result of this journey was the publication of his Itinerario per la terraferma veneziana and a collection of Latin inscriptions.    Sanuto was elected a member of the Maggior Consiglio when only twenty years old (the legal age was twenty-five) and he became a senator in 1498; he noted down everything that was said and done in those assemblies and obtained permission to examine the secret archives of the state. He collected a fine library, which was especially rich in manuscripts and chronicles both Venetian and foreign, including the famous Altino Chronicle, a collection of legends about early Venetian history which served as a foundation of Venetian historiography, and became the friend of all the learned men of the day, Aldo Manuzio dedicating to him his editions of the works of Angelo Poliziano and of the poems of Ovid. It was a great grief to Sanuto when Andrea Navagero was appointed the official historian to continue the history of the republic from the point where Marco Antonio Sabellico left off, and a still greater mortification when, Navagero having died in 1529 without executing his task, Pietro Bembo was appointed to succeed him. Finally in 1531 the value of his work was recognized by the senate, which granted him a pension of 150 gold ducats per annum. He died in 1536. Sanuto played a role in placing the Venetian Jews in the first ever Jewish ghetto, as he stated in a speech in 1515, a year before the ghetto's establishment:  ""I do not want to omit to relate an evil practice resulting with the continuing contact with these Jews, who reside in great numbers in the cities. Formerly, they were not seen outside their houses from palm Sunday until after Easter. Now till yesterday they were going about and it is a very bad thing, and no one says anything to them, since we need them due to the wars and therefore do what they want.""    "
"Marino Sanuto or Sanudo the Elder of Torcello (1260 – 1338) was a Venetian statesman and geographer. [SEP] He is best known for his lifelong attempts to revive the crusading spirit and movement; with this object he wrote his great work, the Liber Secretorum Fidelium Crucis.    Marino himself tells us that he had spent the best part of his life in ""Romania"", the lands of the Eastern empire; of the Morea he had especially intimate knowledge; he had also visited Cyprus, Rhodes, parts of the Syrian, Cilician and Egyptian coasts, France, Flanders and north Germany, both west and east of Denmark. He had been in Acre, Alexandria, Constantinople, Avignon, Bruges and Sluys, as well as (apparently) in Hamburg, Lübeck, Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, Greifswald and Stettin.  Among his friends and correspondents were Guglielmo Bernardi de Furvo, a Venetian nobleman who had travelled extensively in Muslim and Mongol lands (to Tabriz, Baghdad, Damascus and Cairo), Bishop Jerome of Kaffa, in the Crimea, who in 1312 had been sent to reinforce the Catholic mission in China, and perhaps Peter, the English-born bishop of Sevastopolis or Sukhum Kale in western Caucasia, who makes an appeal for aid to the prelates of England in 1330.  Marino Sanuto's ancestor, Marco, had founded the greatness of his family after the Fourth Crusade as duke of the Archipelago and conqueror of Naxos, Paros, etc. (from 1207); and his descendant wrote with a personal interest in the odd question of crushing the Muslim World.

"Jacob Raphael ben Simhah Judah Saraval (c. 1707 – 1782) was an Italian Rabbi, man of letters, and musician. [SEP] Saraval was born in Venice. Saraval was one of the rabbis of Venice who supported Jacob Emden in his dispute with Jonathan Eybeschutz. He communicated with the English scholar, Kennicott, on subjects of biblical philology. In 1752 he was appointed rabbi of Mantua and many documents in the communal archives bear his signature. During the 1760s and 1770s he traveled to Holland and England on behalf of his community. When the anti-Jewish lawyer, Giovanni Battista Benedetti of Ferrara, published his Dissertazione della Religione e del Giuramento degli Ebrei at the beginning of the 1770s, Saraval rejoined with Lettera apologetica (Mantua, 1775). He was also known as a preacher, poet, and composer of piyyutim (liturgical poems), and engaged in various branches of secular culture—arts, literature, and music, in which fields he wrote many works. In addition he translated from various languages. One of his translations, the libretto of Handel's oratorio Esther (apparently done at the request of the Jews of England and Holland), is one of the first free verse translations from English to Hebrew without recourse to the traditional meters.

"Giovanni Antonio Scalfarotto (1672 – 1764) was an Italian architect from Venice. [SEP] He is said to have taught architectural drawing to the engraver Giovanni Piranesi. Like many eclectic architects of his time, it is difficult to pin down a specific style. He was likely limited in part because of the weight of architectural tradition in many of his projects. For example, his designs for the façade of the chiesa of San Rocco, completed posthumously, looked peculiarly antique, but are meant to match the adjacent Scuola di San Rocco. He designed the  present bell tower for the church of San Salvador and San Bartolomeo (1747-1752) near the Rialto. He is best known for the designs of the church of San Simeone Piccolo across the Grand Canal from the modern railroad station. His nephew, Tommaso Temanza was also an architect in Venice.   "

"Michele Steno (Michiel Sten in Venetian Language; 1331 – December 26, 1413) was a Venetian statesman who served as the 63rd Doge of Venice from December 1, 1400 until his death. [SEP]    Steno was born in Venice into a family of some, though not great, wealth, and had lived a dissolute life in youth; he and a number of other young men were at one point nearly executed by the government for covering the Doge Marino Faliero's throne with ""ignominious"" inscriptions against him and his spouse, Aluycia Gradenigo.  He later served as proveditor of Venice, and proved a capable diplomat. In 1400 he was elected as doge as a compromise choice, since previous votes had become deadlocked.  Upon becoming Doge he took to dressing like Lorenzo Celsi, who had been known for his elegance of dress. In his accession's year, Venice begun a successful war against Padua and its lord, Francesco da Carrara, leading to a substantial expansion of the republic in the Italian mainland. During the Christian schism of 1408, Venice sided with Pope Alexander V. An old and ill man in his late years, Steno died in 1413, and was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges. Steno was succeeded as Doge by Tommaso Mocenigo.    Michele Steno is honored as the dedicatee of Johannes Ciconia's motet, ""Venecia, mundi splendor/Michael, qui Stena domus,"" probably on the occasion of Padua's submission to Venetian rule.  Among other rhetorical flourishes, the text praises Michele for his celibate life (vitam celibem).   "
"Giulio Strozzi (1583 - 31 March 1652) was a Venetian poet and libretto writer. [SEP] His libretti were put to music by composers like Claudio Monteverdi, Francesco Cavalli, Francesco Manelli, and Francesco Sacrati. He sometimes used the pseudonym Luigi Zorzisto.    Giulio Strozzi was a bastard, and later legitimized, son of Roberto Strozzi, from the Strozzi family. Born in Venice in 1583, he first studied there before going to the University of Pisa to study law. He lived and worked in Rome, Padua and Urbino before returning to Venice in the 1620s. He was the adoptive father of composer Barbara Strozzi (born in 1619 from Isabella Garzoni, a woman servant living in Strozzi's house, and possibly his illegitimate daughter). He remained there until his death on 31 March 1652.    He wrote poetry and plays, but is best remembered as one of the first writers of libretti, the texts used for all kinds of musical plays but most specifically opera. His earliest known work was in 1609, an oration for the burial of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, for whom he also organized the burial rites. It was the first in a long-term series of efforts to get the patronage of the Medici family during the next decades, including a lengthy dedication of his 1624 reprint of the Venetia edificata to Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.In 1621, he wrote his only epic poem, Venetia edificata. It was expanded and reprinted in 1624. Celebrating the glory of the Republic of Venice, it was at the same time written in support of Galileo Galilei and his controversial scientific theories. He also wrote a translation of the Spanish Lazarillo de Tormes which remained unpublished.From 1627 on, he mostly dedicated himself to writing opera libretti, and he was probably the most important opera writer in Venice in the 1630s and 1640s. He wrote La finta pazza Licori for Claudio Monteverdi in 1627. The two had first met in 1621. The opera was never performed and it is unknown how much of the music for it had been written before the project was abandoned. Both the music and the libretto are lost. In the 1630s and 1640s, Strozzi was one of the driving forces behind the successful growth of opera in Venice. He wrote the libretto for the opening of the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in 1639 (La Delia, music by Francesco Manelli), and for the 1641 opening of the Teatro Novissimo (La finta pazza, music by Francesco Sacrati). In 1630 Strozzi wrote Proserpina Rapita. His last libretto, Veremonda, was written for Francesco Cavalli in 1652. He was a member of the Accademia degli Incogniti in Venice. He was the founder of some cultural ""academies"", gatherings of like-minded intellectuals; these included the Ordinati during his stay in Rome, and the Dubbiosi in Venice.

Francesco Teldi tried to find a level of cooperation between the two realms, encouraging the Mamluks to block Portuguese navigations. The Venetians claimed they could not intervene directly, and encouraged the Mamluk Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri to take action by getting into contact with Indian rulers of Kingdom of Cochin and Kingdom of Cannanore to entice them not to trade with the Portuguese, and the King of Calicut and Sultan of Cambay to fight against them.

"Bajamonte Tiepolo (died after 1329) was a Venetian noble, great-grandson of Doge Jacopo Tiepolo, grandson of Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo, son of Giacomo Tiepolo. [SEP] Bajamonte's wife was the Princess of Rascia. Marco Querini, a fellow conspirator, was his father-in-law. Unhappy with the policies of the reigning Doge, Pietro Gradenigo, Tiepolo and other members of the leading families of the old aristocracy, the Querini (Marco and Piero) and the Badoer (former Partecipazio), organized a conspiracy, put into effect on 15 June 1310, the Feast of Saint Vitus, to overthrow the Doge and the Great Council of Venice. Their plot failed due to treachery, bad planning, insufficient popular support and stormy weather. The rebels were stopped  near Piazza San Marco by the forces faithful to Doge and defeated. According to a popular but historically unconfirmed tale, Tiepolo himself fled from the fight when his standard-bearer was killed by a stone mortar thrown down from a window by the elder woman named Giustina or Lucia Rossi. During their retreat to the San Polo sestiere, the Rialto Bridge was burnt down.  Eventually, Tiepolo surrendered and was then sentenced to exile in Istria, condemned to damnatio memoriae and his house was demolished, as was a house belonging to the Querini brothers. After Tiepolo's house was demolished, a column of infamy was erected in Sant'Agostin bearing these words: ""This land belonged to Bajamonte and now for his iniquitous betrayal, this has been placed to frighten others, and to show these words to everyone forever."" Even from exile, Bajamonte Tiepolo sent a henchman to destroy the column. The man succeeded in breaking it into three pieces before he was caught in the act. He was deprived of a hand and his eyes were put out. The column was repaired and re-erected behind the nearby church of Sant'Agostin. Four hundred years later, in 1785, one Angelo Maria Querini purchased the column, leaving in its place a humble stone plaque that read: ""Loc. Col. Bai. The. MCCCX."" This means ""Location of column of Bajamonte Tiepolo 1310"". The column now lies in the stores of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia. Later, Tiepolo was permanently banished for allegedly contacting the enemies of the Republic and he is unheard of after 1329.  This plot led to the creation the Council of Ten, initially as a temporary institution, but later evolved into a permanent body with the special task of preventing conspiracies and attempted coups.  Its power eventually grew to make it one of the most important elements in the Venetian government."
"Giovanni Battista Tiepolo ( tee-EP-ə-loh, Italian: [dʒoˈvanni batˈtista ˈtjɛːpolo]; March 5, 1696 – March 27, 1770), also known as Giambattista (or Gianbattista) Tiepolo, was an Italian painter and printmaker from the Republic of Venice who painted in the Rococo style, considered important member of the 18th-century Venetian school. [SEP] He was prolific, and worked not only in Italy, but also in Germany and Spain. Giovan Battista Tiepolo, together with Giambattista Pittoni, Canaletto, Giovan Battista Piazzetta, Giuseppe Maria Crespi and Francesco Guardi are considered the traditional Old Masters of that period. Successful from the beginning of his career, he has been described by Michael Levey as ""the greatest decorative painter of eighteenth-century Europe, as well as its most able craftsman.""       Born in Venice, he was the youngest of six children of Domenico and Orsetta Tiepolo. His father was a small shipping merchant who belonged to a family that bore the prestigious patrician name of Tiepolo without claiming any noble descent. Some of the children acquired noble godparents, and Giambattista was originally named after his godfather, a Venetian nobleman called Giovanni Battista Dorià. He was baptised on 16 April 1696 in the local church, San Pietro di Castello (then still officially the cathedral of Venice). His father died about a year later, leaving his mother to bring up a family of young children, presumably in somewhat difficult circumstances.In  1710 he became a pupil of Gregorio Lazzarini, a successful painter with an eclectic style. He was, though, at least equally strongly influenced  by his study of the works of other contemporary artists such as Sebastiano Ricci and Giovanni Battista Piazzetta and those of his Venetian predecessors, especially Tintoretto and Veronese. A biography of his teacher, published in 1732, says that Tiepolo ""departed from [Lazzarini's] studied manner of painting, and, all spirit and fire, embraced a quick and resolute style"". His earliest known works are depictions of the apostles, painted in spandrels as part of the decoration of the church of the Ospedoletto in Venice in 1715–6. At about the same time he became painter to the Doge, Giovanni II Cornaro, and oversaw the hanging of pictures at his palace, as well as painting many works himself, of which only two portraits have been identified.  He painted his first fresco in 1716,  on the ceiling of a church at Biadene, near Treviso.   He probably left Lazzarini's studio in 1717, the year he  was received into the Fraglia or guild of painters.In around 1719–20 he painted a scheme of frescoes for the wealthy, and recently ennobled, publisher Giambattista Baglione in the hall of  his villa at Massanzago near Padua. Tiepolo depicted the Triumph of Aurora on the ceiling, and the Myth of Phaethon on the walls, creating the kind of fluid spatial illusion which was to become a recurring theme in his work.In 1722 he was one of twelve artists commissioned  to contribute a painting   on canvas  of one of the apostles as part of a decorative scheme for the nave of San Stae in Venice. The other artists involved included Ricci, Piazetta, and Pellegrini.    In 1719, Tiepolo married noblewoman Maria Cecilia Guardi, sister of two contemporary Venetian painters, Francesco and Giovanni Antonio Guardi. Tiepolo and his wife had nine children, of whom four daughters and three sons survived to adulthood. Two of his sons, Domenico and Lorenzo, painted with him as his assistants and later achieved some independent recognition, in particular Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo. His children painted figures with a design similar to that of their father, but with distinctive, including genre, styles. His third son became a priest. Fabio Canal, Francesco Lorenzi, and Domenico Pasquini were among his pupils.     Some major commissions came from the patrician  Dolfin family. Dionisio Dolfin, the Archbishop of Udine in Friuli employed him to decorate a chapel in the cathedral at Udine, and then to paint another cycle depicting episodes from the lives of Abraham and his descendants from the Book of Genesis at his archiepiscopal palace (the ""Arcivescovado"") (completed 1726–1728). Despite their elevated subject matter, they are bright in colour, and light-hearted in mood: Michael Levey describes the paintings at the palace  as ""a shimmering set of tableaux, full of wit and elegance.  Tiepolo used a much cooler  palette than previous Venetian painters, in order to create a convincing effect of daylight.  His first masterpieces in Venice were a cycle of ten enormous canvases painted to decorate a large reception room of Ca' Dolfin on the Grand Canal of Venice (ca. 1726–1729), depicting  battles and triumphs from the history of ancient Rome.These early masterpieces, innovative amongst Venetian frescoes for their luminosity, brought him many commissions. He painted canvases for churches such as that of Verolanuova (1735–1740), for the Scuola dei Carmini (1740–1747), and the Chiesa degli Scalzi (1743–1744; now destroyed) in Cannaregio, a ceiling for the Palazzi Archinto and Casati-Dugnani in Milan (1731), the Colleoni Chapel in Bergamo (1732–1733), a ceiling for the Gesuati (Santa Maria del Rosario) in Venice of St. Dominic Instituting the Rosary (1737–1739), Palazzo Clerici, Milan (1740), decorations for Villa Cordellina at Montecchio Maggiore (1743–1744) and for the ballroom of the Palazzo Labia in Venice (now a television studio), showing the Story of Cleopatra (1745–1750).    Tiepolo produced two sets of etchings, the Capricci (c. 1740–1742) and the Scherzi di  fantasia (c. 1743–1757). The ten capricci were first published by Anton Maria Zanetti, incorporated into the third edition of  a  compilation  of woodcuts after Parmigiano. They were not published separately until 1785. The subject matter is often bizarre and fantastical, and the works owe a lot to the example of Salvator Rosa and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione. The 23 Scherzi were etched over more than ten years and privately circulated, only being commercially published after Tiepolo's death, with numbers and titles added by his son, Giandomenico. Subjects include  mysterious Eastern figures, and, in  some of the later prints, scenes of necromancy.    By 1750, Tiepolo's reputation was firmly established throughout Europe, with the help of his friend Francesco Algarotti, an art dealer, critic and collector. That year, at the behest of Prince Bishop Karl Philip von Greiffenklau, he traveled to Würzburg where he arrived in November 1750. He remained there for three years during which he executed ceiling paintings in the New Residenz palace (completed 1744). He frescoed the Kaisersaal salon in collaboration with his sons Giandomenico and Lorenzo and was then invited to deliver a design for the grandiose entrance staircase (Treppenhaus) designed by Balthasar Neumann. It is a massive ceiling fresco at 7287 square feet (677 m2), and was completed in November 1753. His Allegory of the Planets and Continents depicts Apollo embarking on his daily course; deities around him symbolize the planets; allegorical figures (on the cornice) represent the four continents. He included several portraits in the Europe section of this fresco, including a self-portrait; one of his son Giandomenico; one of the prince-bishop von Greiffenklau; one of the painter Antonio Bossi; and one of the architect, Balthasar Neumann.     Tiepolo returned to Venice in 1753. He  was now in demand locally, as well as abroad where he was elected President of the Academy of Padua. He went on to complete theatrical frescoes for churches; the Triumph of Faith for the Chiesa della Pietà; panel frescos for Ca' Rezzonico (which now also houses his ceiling fresco from the Palazzo Barbarigo); and paintings for patrician villas in the Venetian countryside, such as Villa Valmarana in Vicenza and an elaborate panegyric ceiling for the Villa Pisani in Stra. In some  celebrated frescoes at the Palazzo Labia, he depicted two scenes from the life of Cleopatra: Meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra[1] and Banquet of Cleopatra,[2] as well as, in a central ceiling fresco, the Triumph of Bellerophon over Time. Here he  collaborated with  Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna. This connection with Colonna, who also designed sets for opera, highlights the increasing tendency towards composition as a staged fiction in Tiepolo's frescoes. The architecture of the Banquet fresco  also recalls that of  Veronese's Wedding at Cana. In 1757, he painted an altar piece for the Thiene family, representing the apotheosis of Saint Cajetan. It is in the church of hamlet of Rampazzo in the Camisano Vicentino.     In 1761, Charles III commissioned Tiepolo to create a ceiling fresco to decorate the throne room of the Royal Palace of Madrid. The panegyric theme is the Apotheosis of Spain and has allegorical depictions recalling the dominance of Spain in the Americas and across the globe. He also painted two other ceilings in the palace, and carried out many private commissions in Spain.However he suffered from  the jealousy and the bitter opposition of the rising champion of Neoclassicism, Anton Raphael Mengs; at the instigation of Mengs' supporter, the King's confessor Joaquim de Electa, had Tiepolo's series of canvases for the church of S. Pascual at Aranjuez replaced by works by his favourite.Tiepolo died in Madrid on March 27, 1770. After his death, the rise of a stern Neoclassicism and the post-revolutionary decline of absolutism led to the slow decline of the Rococo style associated with his name, but failed to dent his reputation. In 1772, Tiepolo's son was sufficiently respected to be  painter to Doge Giovanni II Cornaro, in charge of the decoration of Palazzo Mocenigo in the sestiere of San Polo, Venice.               "
"Jacopo Tiepolo (died 19 July 1249), also known as Giacomo Tiepolo, was Doge of Venice from 1229 to 1249. [SEP] He had previously served as the first Venetian Duke of Crete, and two terms as Podestà of Constantinople (1218-1220 and 1224-1227). During his first term, following the capture and mysterious end of Peter of Courtenay, Tiepolo acted as de facto ruler of the Latin Empire, negotiating treaties on behalf of the Empire with Egypt and the Seljuk Turks.    Probably born in the latter part of the twelfth century, Jacopo assumed the post of Duke of Crete (Italian: duca di Candia) around the year 1212. During his tenure, Venetian dominion over Crete was challenged considerably by the Greek locals, culminating eventually in its capture at the hands of Marco Sanudo. His success, however, was short-lived, as a Venetian fleet soon arrived, forcing him to evacuate the island. Jacopo was elected Doge on 6 March 1229, his predecessor Pietro Ziani having abdicated the month before. At the election, a stalemate was reached between Jacopo and his rival Marino Dandolo, both of them having twenty votes each. This was rectified by drawing lots, leading to Tiepolo's victory. This is thought to have sparked the feud between the Dandolo, who were an old aristocratic family, and the Tiepolo, who were seen as nouveau-riches. In an attempt to prevent the recurrence of a split vote in future elections, the number of electors was increased from forty to forty-one. Prior to ascending the ducal throne, Tiepolo also had to sign a traditional promissione, seriously limiting his powers.Despite Emperor Frederick II's cordial visit to Venice in 1232, relations between the Empire and the Republic deteriorated. Consequently, in 1239, Venice joined the Lombard League and fought against Ezzelino III da Romano, a powerful ally of the Emperor. In the subsequent fights the Doge's son, Pietro Tiepolo, was captured at the Battle of Cortenuova on 27 November 1237. He was later taken to the Emperor's castle at Trani and hanged, worsening relations further.  Jacopo Tiepolo's dogate brought significant change to Venice. In 1242 the Doge produced Statutum novum, by which Venetian civil law was codified in five books of statutes. This process of codification had been first initiated by Enrico Dandolo some fifty years earlier. Additional to this, Tiepolo had granted land in 1234 to the Dominican and Franciscan orders, upon which two churches were built. These were the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo ('San Zanipolo') and the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.  Tiepolo abdicated in 1249 and retired thereafter to his private residence at Sant' Agostino, in San Polo. Andrea Dandolo's Chronicon Venetum records that he vacated the Doge's Palace on 2 March and died on 19 July. He was buried in the church of San Zanipolo. He married twice, firstly to Maria Storlato, and following her death in 1240 to Valdrada of Sicily. Maria bore him three children: Lorenzo, who served as Doge from 1268 to 1275; the aforementioned Pietro, podestà of Padua; and a third son named Giovanni. Valdrada bore him two children, both young at the time of their father's death, and whose identities remain unknown. She outlived her husband by around three years.   "
"Lorenzo Tiepolo (died August 15, 1275) was Doge of Venice from 1268 until his death. [SEP]    Born in Venice, Lorenzo Tiepolo was the son of Doge Jacopo Tiepolo.  Tiepolo demonstrated skill as commander when, during the War of Saint Sabas with Genoa, he defeated the Genoese at the Battle of Acre in 1258. He served also as a podestà of Fano. In 1262, he took part in the peace negotiation between Venice and prince William of Villehardouin, whose vassal he was for the islands of Skopelos and Skyros , in the aftermath of the War of the Euboeote Succession.In 1268, after the death of Reniero Zeno, Lorenzo was elected as Doge on July 23 of that year, with 25 votes out of 41. Although beloved by the population, he attracted the hostility of the Venetian nobility for his nepotism towards his sons. The position of Cancellier Grande (""Great Chancellor"") was therefore created to thwart such a behaviour.In 1270, a peace treaty was signed with Genoa at Cremona, confirming the Venetian predominance in the Adriatic Sea; however, in that same year a war broke out between Venice and a league of Italian cities including  Bologna, Treviso, Verona, Mantua, Ferrara, Cremona, Recanati, and Ancona due to commercial disputes. After an initial setback in 1271, the Venetians were able to regain the upper hand and the terms of peace were favourable to Venice. Under his dogado, in 1273, Marco Polo began his journey to China. He was to return only in 1295. Tiepolo died in Venice in 1275 and was buried with his father in the Dominican church of San Zanipolo.    His first wife was, according to conflicting traditions, ""either the daughter of the King of Romania or of Bohemund of Brienne, ruler of Rascia"". Probably widowed, he married before 1262 his second wife, Marchesina Ghisi, daughter of Geremia Ghisi.He had two sons from his second marriage, Giacomo and Pietro.   "
"Tiberio Tinelli (1586 – 22 May 1639) was an Italian painter of the early-Baroque period, active mainly in his native city of Venice. [SEP] He trained with Giovanni Contarini, a pupil of the late Titian. Tinelli then either worked under or emulated Leandro Bassano.  He was well known for his portraits of aristocracy, merchants, and intellectuals in Venice, whom he often painted in historical dress. His small pictures of historical and mythological subjects were also popular. Some of his pictures found their way into the collection of Louis XIII, king of France, who knighted him with the order of Michael. He moved later in life in Florence. Domestic afflictions drove him into a state of despondency, causing him to commit suicide.   "
"Domenico Robusti, also known as Domenico Tintoretto, (1560 – 17 May 1635) was an Italian painter from Venice. [SEP] He grew up under the tutelage of his father, the renowned painter Jacopo Tintoretto.       Domenico was born in Venice. At age 17, he became a member of the Venetian painter's guild and, to further his training, worked alongside his father executing paintings in the Doge's Palace in Venice. Domenico then began to work independently in the palace, focusing his work on historical themes, including complex arrangements of multiple figures in battle scenes.  But throughout his life, Domenico also painted several religious commissions. Some of his celebrated altarpieces include St. George Killing the Dragon in San Giorgio Maggiore, the Translation of the Body of St. Mark to Venice in the Scuola of San Marco, An Apparition of St. Mark in the Ducal Church, and altarpieces in Modena and Rimini.  Of further note are Domenico's murals in the Ducal Palace and the Scuola di San Giovanni Evangelista, and the Plague of Venice in San Francesco della Vigna.     It is argued that Domenico's greatest contribution to the history of painting resides in his portraiture. Domenico painted Margarita of Austria who became Queen of Spain through her marriage to Philip II. Other commissioned portraits include the Duchess Margarita, the widow of Duke Alfonso II of Ferrara, the Doge Pasquale Cicogna, Doge Marino Grimani, Marc'Antonio Memmo, Giovanni Bembo, Luigi d’Este, the Count d’Aron and Vincenzo I Gonzaga, the 4th Duke of Mantua. According to Carlo Ridolfi and the evidence of surviving portraits such as that of Sir John Finet, future Master of Ceremonies to Charles I he painted many English visitors to Venice, including the Collector Earl of Arundel and his wife and children.    When Jacopo died in 1594, Domenico handily took over the running of the studio of Tintoretto, with the help of his younger brother Marco, and his assistant Bastian Casser. While Domenico's early work continued on in the vein of his father's artistic vision, coupling phosphorescent colors with figure-laden compositions, his own artistic personality eventually emerged in a tendency to give more focus to landscapes within a composition, or background details. Jacopo's drawings relied heavily on gestural line work, but Domenico's drawings tended towards a chiaroscuro modeling of forms. Though Domenico worked as an artist in the shadow of his father, at times his work was undeniably superior to that of Jacopo Robusti. One example of this success is in the painting Portrait of a Senator. In this portrait, Domenico goes beyond rendering physical likeness and social status and achieves the Renaissance ideal of capturing the individuality of the sitter, an accomplishment that places him in the tradition of Rembrandt, Velasquez or Titian.    In Domenico's youth, he devoted some time to the study of literature which would inform his poetical, historical and moral themes.  He painted four canvases from Ariosto on the subject of Verginella and from Lucretius and Marino he painted a man sitting on a cradle with one foot on the edge of a tomb, implying, “From the cradle to the grave life is but a short step.”       The attribution of paintings from the Tintoretto studio is a subject of scholarly debate in determining which paintings were executed by the father and which by his son. But one such scholar takes this debate of attribution a step further. E. Tietze-Conrat finds Domenico's painting to be so accomplished that she suggests that the Venus with Lute Players, typically attributed to Titian, could perhaps actually be the work of Domenico. When Joachim von Sandrart visited Venice in 1628, he writes of acquiring a painting that he assigns to “Jacopo Tintoretto the Younger” and describes the painting as a Venus reclining on a velvet couch flanked by Cupid with a wreath of laurel and a courtier playing a lute.    At age seventy-four Domenico was stricken with apoplexy and lost the use of his right hand. Though he attempted to paint with his left hand, this proved unsuccessful.  Domenico had toyed with the idea of giving the studio to its present painters for the formation of an academy, but eventually his vexation with these painters caused him to bequeath all to Sebastiano Casser.  Sebastiano, of German descent, married Domenico's sister and eventually adopted the Tintoretto name.  He continued to maintain the shop as a studio and a museum after the death of Domenico in 1635 and Marco in 1637. Domenico died at the age of seventy-five and was buried near his father in Santa Maria dell'Orto.   "
"Tommaso de Mezzo (Latin: Thomae Medii) (c.1447 – ?) was a Venetian noble and playwright. [SEP] He is mostly remembered for his comedy Epirota (the Albanian). De Mezzo, son of Marino de Tommaso, was born circa 1447 in an influential family, originating in Jesolo and having settled in Venice in 975. Various members of his family had served as ambassadors, generals, and in the Great Council (Gran Consiglio). Tommaso himself is not mentioned in any official document until 1465. He collected codexes, and was friends with known Venetian and other intellectuals of the humanistic period, including Ermolao Barbaro, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, and Giovan Battista Scita.De Mezzo became known with his comedy Epirota of 1483, dedicated to his friend Barbaro. It follows the track of the classic humanistic comedies, itself inspired by Plautus works. He was also the author of at least one other comedy, which has been lost.Epirota is of special importance for the Albanian language since it contains text in Albanian, one of the earliest examples in written form to have survived.

"Philip Trajetta (Filippo Traetta) (January 8, 1777 – January 9, 1854) was an Italian-born American composer and music teacher. [SEP] The son of Italian composer Tommaso Traetta, in 1800 he moved as a political refugee to the United States, where he had a successful musical career as a composer and one of the founders of music conservatories in Boston (1801), New York (1812), and Philadelphia (1828).    Filippo Traetta was born in Venice, Italy, on January 8, 1777. He was the son of opera composer Tommaso Traetta and Elizabeth Sund from Russian Finland. The couple met at St. Petersburg when Tommaso was serving at the invitation of Catherine II of Russia as singing instructor and musical director of the opera there. Upon the death of his father, Filippo was about three years of age, placing Elizabeth in charge of his education in Venice. He attended a Jesuit school until the age of 13 and then studied with music teachers Fedele Fenaroli and Salvatore Perillo, from whom he learned counterpoint, the art of the fugue and composition. He was next sent to Naples to study with composer Niccolò Piccinni.In 1799, Traetta was involved in a failed revolution against King Ferdinand IV of Naples. He was arrested for authoring several patriotic, anti-monarchy hymns. He served eight months in prison before he was given a German passport and smuggled into the United States, arriving aboard Mount Vernon, a vessel that belonged to the Derby family of Salem, Massachusetts, on July 3, 1800. Now known as Philip Trajetta, he settled in Boston, Massachusetts. There he and two partners, François Delochaire Mallet of France and Gottlieb Graupner of Germany, announced in an advertisement in the Boston Gazette on November 24, 1800, the founding of a music academy called the American Conservatorio of Boston. It was the first such institution in the United States and lasted just two years. Two of his orchestral works were performed in Boston in that year, a sinfonia and a violin concerto. There he also wrote some of his early works, including ""Washington's Dead March"", a patriotic work marking the death of George Washington in December 1799, which remained popular for decades. In the same year he moved to New York, where he completed The Venetian Maskers, which can be described as the first opera composed in the United States, though it was never staged. In the following two decades he divided his time between New York and Charleston. He relocated to New York City about 1809 and by 1812 founded the American Conservatorio of New York. Advertisements for the Conservatorio's concerts at its home on Fulton Street appeared in local newspapers until 1817. He composed a cantata, Jubilate, Peace, to celebrate the Treaty of Ghent, signed on December 24, 1814, that concluded the War of 1812. He conducted its premiere in New York on February 21, 1815.In the first half of the 1820s, Trajetta settled in Philadelphia, which became his permanent home. By 1828, he founded the American Conservatory in Philadelphia. There he composed two oratorios, Jerusalem in Affliction and Daughter of Zion, which had their premieres in Philadelphia in 1828 and 1829 respectively. A comprehensive history of the oratorio form describes them as ""[p]resumably the earliest oratorios composed in America"". Trajetta continued to give music lessons at the conservatory and to direct musical performances until his death. Trajetta died in Philadelphia on January 9, 1854, and was buried in the Odd Fellows Burial Ground.   "

[SEP]    Born in Venice, Visentini was a pupil of the widely travelled Baroque painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, who had painted some decors in English country houses at the beginning of the 18th century. Visentini is best known today as the engraver for Canaletto's first great series of Venetian vedute published under the title Urbis Venetiarum Prospectus Celebriores ex Antonii Canal, organised by British resident Joseph (Consul) Smith (1682–1770). The series was begun around 1728 and by the time it was completed in 1735, thirty-eight etchings and engravings had been printed. On the Grand Canal, Visentini was commissioned to redesign the façade of the residence of Consul Smith, the Palazzo Balbi. He collaborated with Francesco Zuccarelli on capriccios based on English Palladian villas, again for Consul Smith; some have passed with Smith's collection to the British Royal Collection. In Vicenza, Visentini painted frescoes at the Villa Valmarana, for which Gian Domenico Tiepolo painted the figures. In the 1760s the English architect James Wyatt studied with him as an architectural draughtsman and painter. Visentini's work, the Osservazioni, published in Venice in 1771, was intended as a complement and an extension of a treatise by Teofilo Gallacini (1564–1641), which concerned itself with the errors of Mannerist and early Baroque architecture.

"Giuseppe Zamboni (June 1, 1776 – July 25, 1846) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and physicist who invented the Zamboni pile, an early electric battery similar to the voltaic pile. [SEP]    He was born in either Venice (or, depending on the source, Verona) in northern Italy, in June 1776. Shortly after completing his studies in the seminary at Verona, Abate Zamboni was appointed to the chair of physics in the lyceum of that city. He died in Venice on July 25, 1846.       Zamboni is known to students of physics for an improved version of the dry pile (an electric battery which does not use an electrolyte)  which he invented in 1812. It consists of a number of paper discs coated with zinc foil on one side and manganese dioxide on the other; the moisture of the paper serves as a conductor. By pressing a large number of such discs together in a glass tube, an electromotive force can be obtained that is sufficient to deflect the leaves of an ordinary electroscope. By bringing the terminal knobs of the pile near each other and suspending a light brass ball between them, Zamboni devised what was called an electrostatic clock. The device is so named because the ball oscillating between the knobs looks like a pendulum. In the Oxford Electric Bell experiment at the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University, the terminals of what is believed to be such a pile are fitted with bells that have been continuously ringing since the device was set up in 1840. Note that the Zamboni pile is not a hypothetical perpetual motion device, as all action will eventually cease when the zinc is completely oxidized or the manganese exhausted.    Among Zamboni's works are: ""Della pila elettrica a secco"" (Venice, 1812); ""L'elettromotore perpetuo"" (Venice, 1820); ""Descrizione d'un nuovo galvanometro"" (Venice, 1833).

"Giovanni Battista Zelotti (Italian pronunciation: [dʒoˈvanni batˈtista ddzeˈlɔtti]; 1526 – 28th August 1578) was an Italian painter of the late Renaissance, active in Venice and her mainland territories. [SEP] He appears to have been born in Verona, then part of the Venetian mainland, and trained with Antonio Badile and Domenico Riccio, as well as perhaps Titian. Bernasconi claims he trained with his uncle Paolo Farinati. He is called Battista da Verona by Vasari, and was also known as Battista Farinati. He was a contemporary of Paolo Veronese and shared work in the Villa Soranza near Castelfranco (1551) and at Venice: the ceiling of the Sala del Consiglio dei Dieci in the Doge's Palace (1553-4); the Biblioteca Marciana (1556-7), and the Palazzo Trevisan (1557) on Murano. Zelotti came to embody the Veronese tradition on the mainland. He frescoed villas designed by Andrea Palladio, notably Villa Emo and Villa Foscari, where he worked with Bernardino India and Battista Franco: the exact number of Palladian villas he frescoed is not known. With the painter Giovanni Antonio Fasolo he worked also at Villa Caldogno (about 1570) and at Palazzo Porto Colleoni Thiene. In the 1570s he decorated the Castello del Catajo of the Obizzi family at Battaglia Terme with 40 frescoes. He also worked in Mantua for the house of Gonzaga.

"Apostolo Zeno (11 December 1669 in Venice – 11 November 1750 in Venice) was a Venetian poet, librettist, journalist, and man of letters. [SEP]    Apostolo Zeno was born in Venice to a colonial branch of the Zeno family, an ancient Venetian patrician family. His family had been transplanted from Venice to the Kingdom of Candia in the 13th century in order to maintain Venetian order and suppress any rebellious subjects. Following the assault on the island by the Ottoman Empire, the remaining members of his family returned to Venice. Upon return they were not readmitted to the patrician class, but were only able to obtain status as ordinary citizens. His father was Pietro Zeno, a doctor of medicine, and his mother, Caterina Sevasto, belonged to an illustrious and powerful family from Candia, Crete.Having lost his father at an early age, he was left to the care of his mother, who remarried to Venetian senator Pier Antonio Cornaro. His education was entrusted to the Somaschi Fathers.He was in 1691 among the founders of the Accademia degli Animosi. In 1695, he composed his first libretto, Gli inganni felici, which obtained great success, making him a fashionable librettist. From 1705, he worked with Pietro Pariati, keeping the theatrical scenes for himself and leaving to Pariati the composition of the libretti.   "
"Reniero Zeno (Venetian: Renieri Zen) (died July 7, 1268) was the 45th Doge of Venice, reigning from January 1, 1253 until his death in 1268. [SEP]    The first references to Zeno in historical sources describe him as a diplomat in France and Italy, where he was excommunicated for having pushed Bologna to avoid paying tributes to the Papal States. In 1240 he helped Doge Jacopo Tiepolo during the siege of Ferrara, in 1242 put down a revolt in Zara and in 1244 he was named capitano generale da Mar (fleet commander) of the Republic of Venice. He was also the podestà (Chief Magistrate) of numerous Italian cities. After the death of Marino Morosini, Zeno, who was then podestà of Fermo, was elected Doge with 21 out of 41 votes. In 1256–1259 he, already lifted from the excommunication, helped Pope Alexander IV and Treviso in the war for the Marca Trevigiana against the Ghibelline warlord Ezzelino IV da Romano, whose death resolved the conflict. In the meantime, Venice found itself engaged in a war against the Republic of Genoa, its greatest rival in the Mediterranean. The cause of the conflict was the sacking by the Genoese of the Venetian quarter in Tyre. When the future Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo destroyed the Genoese fleet in 1257, Genoa allied with Michael VIII Palaeologus, who in 1261 captured Constantinople, putting an end to the Latin Empire and awarding Genoans the privileges formerly held by Venetians. Venice replied by building a large fleet which again defeated the Genoese in Settepozzi in 1263. In 1268 a five-year truce was signed with Byzantine Empire which restored to the Venetians many of their former priviliegies, establishing an uneasy balance between the two maritime republics, allowing them to compete freely in the Levant. Also, under Zeno's reign a series of 129 law articles were approved which gave Venice a modern maritime legislation. Zeno died in Venice in 1268. His dogaressa was Loicia da Prata, described as beautiful and charitable. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges.   "
"Francesco Zoppis (Venice, 1715 - after 1781) was an Italian composer. [SEP]    Little is known of his artistic beginnings. The first mention of him is from 1739, when the travelling opera company of Pietro Mignotti performed his opera Lucio Papirio ditattore in Graz. In 1745 was Zoppis temporarily engaged as the ""vice-kapellmeister"" at the court of the kurfürst Clemens August in Bonn. In 1748 he came to Prague, where he joined the Locatelli ensemble. He began to cooperate with e. g. Ch. W. Gluck and G. M. Rutini. Zoppis composed his first Prague opera, Vologeso, in 1753. A year later, in 1754, he introduced another opera - Siroe, re di Persia. The music was written to the libretto of Pietro Metastasio. Zoppis left Prague together with Locatelli and moved to St. Petersburgh, where he conducted the local opera.   "

"Carola (fl. 811) was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Obelerio degli Antenori (r. 804-811).  She was politically active and exerted influence over the affairs of state. [SEP] She was the first consort of a Venetian doge with the title and position of dogaressa of Venice.     Carola was originally a Frankish countess and a lady-in-waiting to the empress of Charles the Great.  She met Obelerio when he and his brother Beato visited the court of Charles in Aix-La-Chapelle.  Charles gave his blessing to the union and declared it to be a political alliance and gave his protection to Venice.  Carola was described as strong-willed, energetic and with an ability to create respect and obedience.  She was somewhat disliked for the perceived Frankish influence she represented.Carola participated in an legendary intrigue constructed by her brother-in-law Beato.  According to legend, Beato married the Byzantine Princess Cassandra in order to replace Doge Obelerio and Dogaressa Carola with himself and Cassandra by support of the Byzantines.  Upon the arrival of Cassandra to Venice, however, Carola destroyed the alliance between Beato and Cassandra by convincing Cassandra to engage in adultery with her youngest brother-in-law, Valentino.   She did succeed, but reportedly fell in love with Valentino herself in the process.  When a Byzantine fleet was sighted in the Adriatic Sea, the Doge felt threatened enough to send for Frankish assistance.  His appeal to the Franks, however, insulted the Byzantines, which lead to the capture of Obelario and Carola as well as Beato and Cassandra, which were all imprisoned in Constantinople.   "
"Obelerio degli Antenori (also Antenoreo) was the ninth traditional (seventh historical) Doge of Venice from 804 to 811. [SEP]    He was the son of Encagilio. Already a tribune during the dogeship of Giovanni Galbaio, he and other Venetian pro-Frankish leaders fled to Treviso. There they elected Obelerio their leader and he led them back to Venice, whence the Galbaii fled, and was elected doge at Malamocco. Obelerio immediately copied his predecessors and appointed as associate doge one of his relatives, his brother Beato. Soon the Antenori were out of favour and the feud between the various factions, the pro-Byzantine at Heraclea and the republican at Malamocco, had fired up. The exiled patriarch of Grado, Fortunatus, returned to Venice from the court of Charlemagne at Aachen and offered to put Venetia under the protection of the Franks if he was reinstated. Obelerio obliged him and happily recognised Frankish sovereignty in return for Frankish protection and legitimation. Obelerio and Beato did homage to Charlemagne in Aachen on Christmas Day 805. Obelerio even chose a Frankish bride: Carola, the first dogaressa. This act precipitated a war with Byzantium. In 809, a fleet landed in the Venetian lagoon and attacked a Frankish flotilla at Comacchio but was defeated. Obelerio and Beato then raised their other brother Valentino to the dogeship alongside them. This was the last straw and the people rose against them; they called in King Pepin of Italy. He besieged Venice, but only at the last minute did the Antenori try to save face by taking up arms against him. They were booted and Agnello Participazio, who had defended Venice from the beginning, was elected doge. Obelerio spent the next two decades in exile in Constantinople. He returned on the death of Giustiniano Participazio in 832 with a band of faithful men to reclaim the dogeship. He landed at Vigilia, near Malamocco, but the legitimate doge, Giovanni Participazio, razed the two cities and killed Obelerio, displaying his head in the market.   "
"Giovanni Galbaio was the eighth Doge of Venice (787–804) according to tradition, but only the sixth historically verifiable one. [SEP]    He succeeded his father Maurizio Galbaio, who had associated him as doge in 778. The Byzantine emperor Leo IV the Khazar recognised his title in that year, though the attempt to set up a hereditary monarchy endangered Maurizio's own dogeship.  Giovanni had been briefly held captive by the Lombard king Desiderius after a campaign in Istria, but his father, through the pope, sent ambassadors to Charlemagne, the king of the Franks, to petition for Giovanni's release.    Upon his inheriting, without election, the full office of his father, he immediately began a vendetta against the patriarch of Grado, who represented the church and its opposition to the slave trade. Charlemagne, a dutiful son of the church and now king of Lombardy, supported the abolition of slavery in his domains and thus came to resent the Venetian commerce in the Adriatic. The patriarch, in the reign of Maurizio, had even instigated the expulsion and confiscation of goods of the Venetian merchants in the Pentapolis. Giovanni had the Empress Irene name his son Maurizio co-doge.  Trying to counterinfluence the patriarch, Giovanni appointed his sixteen-year-old nephew Christopher bishop of Olivolo. The patriarch refused to consecrate him, officially due to his age, but actually because of his anti-Frankish stances. Maurizio II was sent to attack Grado with a flotilla of ships. There the elderly patriarch was thrown to his death from the tower. The opposition to the Galbaii family fled to Treviso while the nephew of the patriarch, Fortunatus, was elected in his stead and immediately fled to the Frankish court. The opposition crystallised under the leadership of one Obelerio degli Antenori and returned to Venice. Giovanni, with Maurizio and Christopher, fled to Mantua in 803, where they all probably died. Obelerio succeeded them.  The Galbaio family later returned to Venice and assumed the name of Querini.   "
"Agnello Participazio (Latin: Agnellus Particiacus) was the tenth traditional and eighth (historical) doge of  the Duchy of Venetia from 811 to 827. [SEP] He was born to a rich merchant family from Heraclea and was one of the earliest settlers in the Rivoalto group of islands. His family had provided a number of tribuni militum of Rivoalto. He owned property near the Church of Santi Apostoli. A building in the nearby Campiello del Cason was the residence of the tribunes. Agnello was married to the dogaressa Elena.The name Agnello appeared in the earliest  documents (819 and 820) and in John the Deacon's chronicle Historia Veneticorum. It appeared as Angelo in a document datable to 1023. The surname is attested only later, in John the Deacon's chronicle, who attributed it only to Orso II Participazio (911-932). Its attribution to the whole household and to the prior Participazio doges (Agnello Giustiniano (827–829), Giovanni I (829–836), Orso I (864–881) and Giovanni II (881–887) was established by 19th century scholars.  According to some historians Agnello was elected, while others say that he was appointed by Arsaphios, a Byzantine envoy.    With the attempt of Pepin, the king of Italy and son of the emperor Charlemagne, to invade the Lagoon of Venice, the co-doges Obelerio, Beato, and Valentino degli Antenori fled the duchy of Venetia. After Pepin withdrew, Agnello was elected to the dogeship. He moved the ducal seat from Malamocco to Rivolato. He built the first doge's palace near the old church of San Teodoro. The location was (and still is) where St. Marks Square is now. It was like a castle to defend him more from possible internal enemies than external ones. It burned down when it was set alight during a rebellion against the doge Pietro IV Candiano (959-76).Pepin's attempt to invade the duchy of Venetia led the Carolingian and the Byzantine empires to agree the Peace of Aachen in 812, which was ratified in 814. In this the duchy of Venetia remained under the Byzantines. Its protection against enemies form the mainland was guaranteed. Its boundaries with the Kingdom of Italy were defined.  Its rights to sail freely in the Adriatic Sea were recognised. Agnello sent his elder son, Giustiniano, on a mission to Constantinople. While Giustiniano was away, he appointed his other son Giovanni as co-doge. Giustiniano was enraged. He refused to go to the palace and went to live at the nearby church of San Severo. He managed to change his father’s mind. Giustiniano and his young son Agnello were raised to the co-dogeship. Giovanni was demoted and exiled to Zara (Zadar). He escaped and went to Dalmatia. He then went to Bergamo and put himself under the protection of the emperor Louis II of Italy. Agnello and Giustiniano sent envoys to the emperor to ask for Giovanni to be handed over. The emperor agreed and extradited Giovanni. He was sent to Constantinople with his wife. Later, in 820, the young Agnello was sent to Constantinople for the occasion of the coronation of Michael II, the new Byzantine emperor. He died while he was there.The dogeships of Giovanni Galbaio (787–804) and Obelerio degli Antenori (804-811) had been marred by a bitter conflict between a pro-Byzantine faction and a pro-Frankish one, which caused great instability and contributed to Pepin's attempted invasion. Fortunato, the patriarch of Grado, was pro-Frankish and a key player in this conflict. Agnello deposed him to avoid further troubles.  Fortunato fled to France. Agnello replaced him with Giovanni, the abbot of San Servolo.One of Agnello's first priorities was to repopulate the places Pepin had ravaged: Chioggia and Albiola. As he was originally form Heraclea, which had been destroyed by his predecessor and by Pepin, he had it rebuilt and renamed Cittanova (New City). He had the church of San Pellegrino, which had been demolished by the inhabitants of Grado during Pepin's attack, rebuilt.Agnello took measures to coordinate the development of Rivoalto. He put Nicolò Ardisonio in charge of fortifying the lidi (Lido and Pelletrina, the outlying islands of the lagoon) against the sea, also placing Lorenzo Alimpato in charge of land reclamation and Pietro Tradonico of the construction of new buildings. This was the beginning of the Rivolato group of islands developing into the city of Venice. Agnello founded monasteries on the islands of Barnaba and San Giuliano and provided priests with good supplies for the maintenance and decoration of churches wherever this was needed. He and his son Giovanni donated land on their properties in San Illario to the monks on the island of San Servolo.The Byzantine emperor Leo V the Armenian sent the relics of St. Zachary, paid for the construction of a monastery and church of San Zaccaria dedicated to this saint and sent architects to build it. He needed the friendship of Venice to obtain its support against the Saracens who were invading Sicily.   "
"Giovanni I Participazio (or Particiaco) (died 837) was the tenth (historical) or twelfth (traditional) Doge of Venice from the death of his brother in 829 to his arrest and deposition in 836. [SEP]     His father, Agnello, had appointed him co-doge while his brother Giustiniano was away in Constantinople. When Giustiniano returned, Agnello was deposed and Giovanni, who was part of the pro-Frankish faction, exiled to Zara (in today's Croatia). Giovanni was recalled by his brother from Constantinople in 829 and appointed to succeed him. He was duly elected by the assembly and continued the work of Giustiniano in construction of a new basilica for the body of Saint Mark. The rest of his reign was occupied by quarrels and problems, internal and external.  The first problem was the return of Obelerio degli Antenori, Doge of Venice from 804 to 811, from Constantinople after twenty years of exile. He disembarked at Vigilia, near Malamocco, with a band of followers and laid claim to the dogeship. Malamocco and Vigilia declared for him and both were burned by Giovanni. Obelerio was killed and his head displayed to the people.  A revolt in Venice itself placed one of the tribunes, Caroso, on the throne for less than six months, during which Giovanni, surprised by the participation of trusted family members in the rebellion, resided in refuge at the court of Lothair, King of the Lombards. Soon, the Participazio had removed Caroso and blinded him, recalling Giovanni to Venice. His dictatorial rule provoked an aristocratic reaction, led by the Mastalici, and one night in 836, an ambush was laid at the exit of the church of S. Pietro in Olivolo. They arrested him, tonsured him, and put him in the church at Grado.    "
"Giovanni II Participazio (or Particiaco) was the thirteenth (historical) or fifteenth (traditional) Doge of Venice after the death of his father, Orso I, in 881 until his resignation in 887. [SEP] Prior to that, he co-ruled with his father.    He was a nepotist intent on continuing the power of his own dynasty. He tried to obtain the government of Comacchio for his brother Badoaro and to this end sent him to the pope. However, Marinus, count of Comacchio, captured him and sent him back to Venice, where he soon died. Giovanni attacked and devastated Comacchio, but he could not hold it, because it was the pope's. In 883, Giovanni negotiated a favourable treaty with the Emperor Charles the Fat. Giovanni associated his brother Pietro in the dogeship, but he died. He then associated his brother Orso, but he refused to accept it until Giovanni became seriously ill. Then the Venetians elected Pietro Candiano doge and Giovanni retired to private life. He tried to reobtain the dogeship on the death of Candiano, but failed due to his poor health.   "
"Giustiniano Participazio (Latin: Agnellus Iustinianus Particiacus; died 829) was the eleventh (traditional) or ninth (historical) Doge of Venice from 825 to his death. [SEP] His four years on the ducal throne were very eventful. He was made hypatus by the Byzantine emperor Leo V the Armenian.    Giustiniano was away in Constantinople when his father, the then-reigning Doge Agnello, appointed his younger brother Giovanni as co-doge. When Giustiniano returned, he flew into a fury. Agnello appointed his third son, also Agnello, co-doge and began to oppose Giustiniano, even besieging him in the church of San Severo. Giustiniano gained the upper hand, however, and exiled his younger brother and succeeded his father as doge in 827. He was married to a woman named Felicita.The Byzantine Emperor, Michael II, offered military support to Venice in return for a contingent of Venetians in his expedition against the Aghlabid expeditionary force at Sicily. The success of the expedition increased the prestige of the city. While the contest (fomented by Charlemagne and by Lothair I) between the patriarchs of Grado and Aquileia over the Istrian bishoprics continued, Giustiniano worked to increase the prestige of the Venetian church itself. Traditionally, Venice was first evangelised by Saint Mark himself and many Venetians made the pilgrimage to Mark's grave in Alexandria, Egypt. According to tradition, Giustiniano ordered merchants, Buono di Malamocco and Rustico di Torcello, to corrupt the Alexandrine monks which guarded the body of the evangelist and steal it away secretly to Venice. Hiding the body amongst some pork, the Venetian ship slipped through customs and sailed into Venice on 31 January 828 with the body of Saint Mark. Giustiniano decided to build a ducal chapel dedicated to Saint Mark to house his remains: the first Basilica di San Marco in Venice.Giustiniano recalled his brother Giovanni from Constantinople, because he had no sons by his wife, and appointed him to continue the construction of the new church for Venice's new patron saint. Giovanni succeeded the aged Giustiniano on the latter's death the next year.   "
"Orso I Participazio (Latin: Ursus Particiacus; died 881), also known as Orso I Badoer, was Doge of Venice from 864 until 881. [SEP] He was, according to tradition, the fourteenth doge, though historically he is only the twelfth.     He was elected, probably by acclamation, after several days of street fighting that followed the assassination of his predecessor, Pietro Tradonico, on 13 September 864. Those responsible, numbering around eight, were later arrested and punished accordingly: some were executed, others condemned to exile in France and Constantinople.  Orso's most significant accomplishment was his reform of Venetian government. Until his tenure, the practical power of the Doge had been unlimited; the authority of the tribunes, whose role was to check the Doge's power, had declined; and it had become the practice of the Doge to co-opt his son or brother as his fellow Doge, thus introducing a hereditary tendency to the office. Orso instituted elected judges who would serve as magistrates as well as counsellors to the Doge. Orso also reorganized the ecclesiastical structure of the islands of Venice by securing the creation of five new bishoprics, thus thwarting the domination of the Patriarch of Aquileia and the Patriarch of Grado.Orso, like Tradonico, continued the fight against the Slavic and Saracen pirates, who inhabited the Adriatic. He was aided by newly constructed larger ships.  Orso presented to Byzantine Emperor Basil I a bell for the basilica Hagia Sophia.   He had six children with a wife whose identity is unknown. According to the Chronicon Venetum they were Giovanni, Badoario, Orso, Pietro, Felicia and Giovanna. The eldest, Giovanni, served for some time as his father's co-regent, and was elected Doge following his death in 881.    "
"Pietro I Candiano (c. 842 – 18 September 887) was briefly the sixteenth Doge of Venice in 887. [SEP]     He followed Orso I Participazio and Giovanni II Participazio as Doge of Venice, elected to the throne at the side of the elderly, and beloved, Giovanni circa April 887. He launched a military attempt against the Narentines in Dalmatia, who were hostile to Venetia after 886. As soon as he became Doge, he advanced with a fleet of twelve galleys to the port of Makarska (Italian: Mokro), where he sank five Narentine ships. He landed near Mokro and advanced deeper inland, but the Narentines crushed his forces, killing him in open battle on 18 September 887. He was the first Doge to die in a battle for La Serenissima (Italian for The Most Serene, referring to the Republic of Venice).  Following his death, the Venetians began to pay prince Branimir of Croatia (879–892) an annual tribute for the right to travel and trade in the Croatian part of the Adriatic; between Pietro's death in 887 and 948, no new war was recorded with the Croats, which is thought to show they paid tribute to maintain the peace. Giovanni briefly ruled Venice until a successor could be found for Candiano. It was Pietro Tribuno, his great-nephew. His son, Pietro II Candiano, also later became Doge.   "
"Pietro Tradonico (Latin: Petrus Tradonicus; c. 800 - 13 September 864) was Doge of Venice from 836 to 864. [SEP] He was, according to tradition, the thirteenth doge, though historically he is only the eleventh. His election broke the power of the Participazio family.    An Istrian native, he was perhaps born in the late eighth or early ninth century. His family, originally from Pula, had come to Rialto from Jesolo. He was illiterate and thus signed many state documents with a signum manus. He was a warrior, not an administrator. At his election in 836 he nominated his son Giovanni as co-regent, continuing the process begun a century earlier of establishing a hereditary dukedom with dynastic succession. All previous attempts had failed and this would turn out no differently. He fought the Saracens of Bari and Taranto, who had earlier defeated Venice at Sansego, an island south of Pula. He had to deal not only with Saracen pirates, but with Slavs as well. He led a large fleet against in 839 to punish the Narentines for raiding and slaughtering several Venetian traders returning from Benevento in 834–835. He made peace with Duke Mislav of the Croats of Dalmatia and a Narentine prince by the name of Družak (Drosaico, Marianorum judice). His military assault on the Neretvians in 840 failed and he lost more than 100 men and had to return Venetia. The Neretvians continued to push against him and, in 846, breached Venice itself and raided the neighbouring lagoon city of Caorle. In 840, the Emperor Lothair I recognised the independence of Venice and its authority over the lagoon as far as the ""aquas salas"", i.e., the sea (""salt waters""), already recognised by Byzantium. From the latter he received the titles of spatharius and hypatus. In Spring 856, Pietro and his son and co-regent Giovanni hosted Emperor Louis II and his wife Engelberga in a three-day visit to Venice. During this visit the Emperor stood godfather to Giovanni's daughter, whose name is not known. Giovanni died in 863. Pietro himself died a year later on 13 September 864, having been ambushed and attacked by a group of malcontents while returning from vespers at the Church of San Zaccaria. His body was recovered a while later by monks of San Zaccaria, who buried him in the church. Those responsible for his murder were punished accordingly: some were executed, others condemned to exile in France and Constantinople. He was succeeded by Orso Participazio, whose rise to power was perhaps facilitated by the absence of a Tradonico heir.   "
"Pietro Tribuno (died 912) was the Doge of Venice from 887 to his death. [SEP]    He was the son of Domenico Tribuno and Agnella, the niece of Pietro Tradonico. He succeeded Pietro I Candiano,  following a brief period during which the elderly and infirm Giovanni II Participazio administered the city. Immediately after his succession, he began negotiations with the successors of Charles the Fat. In 888, he negotiated a treaty with Arnulf of Carinthia and again in 891. The first treaty secured for the jurisdiction over Venetian citizens abroad. The intent of this clause was to increase Venetian trade in the Carolingian Empire by extending to such merchants who did so trade the protection of their own laws. The economic benefits were immediate and the 890s saw growth in Venice's relatively new iron industry. Meanwhile, land reclamation continued apace. In 898, the Magyars invaded Venetia for the first time, but this raid turned out to be a precursor to something more permanent. In 899, the whole of Lombardy was overrun. The Magyars then turned on Venice. First Cittanova, Fine, and Equilo fell, and then Altino. Finally, advancing past Chioggia and Pellestrina towards Malamocco, the Magyars arrived at Albiola to meet a vast Venetian host under Tribuno awaiting them. The Magyars used small coracles for water crossings and these proved massively inefficient against the Venetian galleys. The Magyars were routed in the first great Venetian military victory since the defeat of Pepin of Italy almost a century prior. After the Magyar flight, Tribuno set to work improving the inner defences of the Rialto. He constructed a vast wall from eastern Olivolo to the Riva degli Schiavoni and thence to Santa Maria Zobenigo. He also stretched a gigantic chain across the Grand Canal from S. Gregorio on Dorsoduro to a site now occupied by the Palazzo Gaggia. According to the chronicler John the Deacon, writing a century later, with the construction of this wall Venice became a civitas, often translated ""city;"" an event marking a turning point in Venetian history. Tribuno died in 912 and was buried in S. Zaccaria. His dogaressa was Angela Sanudo. He was succeeded by Orso II Participazio.   "

"Felicia Malipiero (d. after 978), was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Pietro I Orseolo (r. 976-978) and mother of doge Pietro II Orseolo. [SEP]    Felicia Malipiero is described as very religious and strict, and spent her time in pious duties.  Alongside her spouse, she founded a hospital for pilgrims to the memory of doge Pietro Tradonico: while her spouse spent his time praying before the altar of the hospital, she devoted her time to caring for the sick and menial chores. When her spouse abdicated and entered a Camaldolese monastery in France, Malipiero entered the Benedictine Monastery of San Zaccaria and became a nun. Although in a monastery, she continued being the adviser of her ruling sons, advising them always to protect the power of the church.   "
"Valdrada (Gualdrada) of Tuscany (died 997), was a Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Pietro IV Candiano (r. 959-976).    She was the daughter of Hubert, Duke of Spoleto, grandfather of Mathilda of Tuscany. [SEP] She was arranged to be married to Pietro by Emperor Otto III after the divorce of his former dogaressa, Giovanniccia Candiano. She brought a dowry including castles and a retinue of slaves.     She and the Doge created the custom of the Mundio, in which the doge granted half of his income to his consort. Valdrada became unpopular in Venice because of her arrogance, but she had good relations with Pietro.  She supported his ambitions and strengthened his status by behaving as a Queen, and was reportedly the first dogaressa to follow a royal ceremonial protocol. She introduced bull fighting in Venice, which became popular and at which she presided.Slavery became a controversial issue in Venice because of her retinue of slaves, but when her spouse asked her to free them, she replied that she was a subject of the emperor, but not of the doge.  In 976 the Venetians rebelled.  They set fire to the residence of the Doge and the family fled he with their small son Pietre in his arms, she with her daughter Marina in hers. Valdrada begged for the life of her son, but both her husband and her son were lynched. She was allowed to leave with her daughter, perhaps because Venice feared the vengeance of the emperor if she was harmed.    She fled to Empress Adelaide in Verona. She demanded that her dowry be restored from Venice, and that Venice be destroyed by the emperor for the rebellion.  After negotiations, a settlement was reached. She refused to become a nun as a widow, which was the Venetian custom, and settled at the court of her brother in Tuscany, where she died. Her daughter Marina became the Dogaressa of the Doge Tribuno Memmo, but he was deposed in 990, after which Marina became a nun.   "
"Pietro II Candiano (c. 872 – 939) was the nineteenth Doge of Venice between 932 and 939. [SEP]  He followed Orso II Participazio (912–932) to become Doge in 932.      The Candiano family was the most important family of Venice during the tenth century. Pietro II's father Pietro I was the first Candiano to become doge in 887, but died soon after while fighting the Narentines.  At the beginning of his term in 932, Pietro II cosigned a letter with Marinus Contarini, the Patriarch of Grado, which he sent to the Synod of Erfurt asking for the expulsion from Germany of the Jews who refused to convert to Christianity.  The King of Germany Henri I—who presided over the Synod—did not follow his recommendation though.With the weakening power of the Byzantine Empire in the Adriatic Sea, Venice asserted an independent policy of taking control the northern part of the sea. Pietro II began this expansion in the area, notably against the rival city of Comacchio, which he burnt to the ground after it had attacked Venetian ships.  He also expanded the territory of Venice to Istria, by capturing Capodistria (now Koper in Slovenia). He then received the submission of other Istrian cities thanks to an economic blockade of the area.He died in 939 and was succeeded by Pietro Participazio (son of Orso II). Pietro II's son Pietro III (942–959) and his two grandsons Pietro IV (959–976) and Vitale (978–979) also became doges. They all continued Pietro II's expansionist policy in the Gulf of Venice.    "
"Pietro III Candiano was the Doge of Venice from 942 until 959. [SEP] He was the son of Pietro II Candiano.    In 948 he led a fleet of 33 galleys to punish the Dalmatian pirates, the Narentines, for repeatedly raiding against Venetian shipping in the Adriatic Sea. After the attempt failed, he tried again, but the result was a peace treaty that made the Venice pay tribute to the Narentines for safe passage for the next 50 years, until Doge Pietro II Orseolo's reign. His dogaressa was Arcielda Candiano.His two sons were Doge Pietro IV Candiano (930 - 976) and Domenigo Candiano, Bishop of Torcello.   "
"Pietro IV Candiano (died 976) was the twenty-second (traditional) or twentieth (historical) doge of Venice from 959 to his death. [SEP] He was the eldest son of Pietro III Candiano, with whom he co-reigned and whom he was elected to succeed.    The father of Pietro IV, Pietro III, appointed him co-doge. Towards the end of his father's dogeship, Pietro IV rebelled against him. The revolt failed thanks to popular support for the doge. Pietro III managed to prevent his execution but could not stop his exile.The rebellion of Pietro IV was probably related to the situation in Italy at the time. Pietro IV supported Berengar II, the king of Italy, while his father pursued a neutral policy. Berengar II's Kingdom of Italy was  taken over by Otto I (who later became emperor) in 952. Berengar swore loyalty to Otto I, who gave him back the title of king of Italy, but as his vassal king. He was resentful and rebellious and attacked the March of Verona, an ally of the emperor and even the Papal States and Rome. The exiled Pietro IV went to Ivrea, where the margrave, Guy of Ivrea took him to his father, Berengar II. He then joined the military campaigns which Adalbert, the son of Berengar II, and Hubert, , were conducting against Theobald II, Duke of Spoleto and Camerino. Berengar II allowed Pietro to conduct military operations in Ravenna. With six ships from Ravenna, he captured seven Venetian ships. He returned to Venice when his father died, two and a half months after he had been exiled.    When Pietro III died in 959, Pietro IV surprisingly became the next doge. Probably due to the turbulent recent past, Pietro imposed an oath of loyalty to his power, which was not a Venetian custom. It was probably an import from the mainland. He resumed Venice's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, which his father had interrupted. He renewed a ban of the slave trade. His ban was with regard to this trade with the Byzantines. No Venetian could lend money to them which would be used to buy slaves, transport slaves to their territories or receive money from them to carry slaves. In a nepotist move, Pietro had the rival candidate to the position of Bishop of Torcello accused of simony, blinded and expelled so that he could install his brother Vitale to this bishopric. In 969 he procured him the Patriarchate of Grado, the most powerful ecclesiastic position in the duchy of Venice.Pietro destroyed Oderzo, which controlled the routes towards northern Europe. He subdued Ferrara, which was emerging as the main trade centre in the area of the River Po and competed with Venice over trade in this area. For political reasons, Pietro repudiated his first wife, Giovanniccia, forcing her into the monastery of San Zaccaria. He had a son with her, Vitale. In 966, Pietro remarried to Waldrada, the daughter of Hubert, the marquis of Tuscany, and a cousin of the wife of the emperor Otto I. As the most powerful woman in Italy, Waldrada brought Pietro a large dowry both in money and properties in Friuli, the March of Treviso, Andria and the Ferrara area. The location of these properties is unclear.Pietro's actions were probably related to the changing political situation in Italy. In 961/64 Otto I had made a second expedition to Italy, took the title of king of Italy, defeated Berengar II and imprisoned him in 963. In 966 Adalbert, the son of Berengar, rebelled but was defeated. Otto I was firmly in charge of Italy. Betrolini notes that various historians think that there was an alliance  between Otto I and Pietro IV and that this is indicated by  Pietro's marriage to Waldrada, a relative of Otto, and the fact that in 963 Otto I confirmed the monastery of San Zaccaria's property in the county of Padua in favour to its abbess Giovanna, who was probably Pietro's first wife, and granted tax assets in the county of Treviso to a Vitale Candiano, whom they identify as Pietro's brother (both counties were in the Kingdom of Italy).Guido Mor disagrees with this interpretation. He thinks that the links Pietro had with Berengar II, especially those with Waldrada's father, when he was in exile (see above) initially made an alliance with Otto I unlikely. He points out that Waldrada's father had been hostile to Otto I during his second expedition and had to flee in 962-63 and suggests that Pietro's second marriage might have taken place then, in 962–63, and that it sealed his support to Otto's opponents. He also argues that Otto's mentioned grants were to people Pietro had alienated. Giovanna, as a repudiated wife, must have been hostile to Pietro. Mor also thinks that the mentioned Vitale Candiano was not Pietro's brother, but the son he had with Giovanniccia, who had been forced into the priesthood. He sees Otto's grants as measures to create ties with a Venetian faction which was opposed to Pietro.To Mor other measures Otto took also indicate his hostility towards Pietro. When Otto crushed the anti-Otto faction, he gave privileges to the bishop of Belluno, whose seat was in Oderzo, and allowed the bishop of Padua, whose territory bordered that of Venice, to build a castle. Mor sees Pietro's mentioned military actions against Oderzo and Ferrara as being part of his opposition to Otto. When Otto secured his control over Italy, Pietro was forced to change stance and to seek a rapprochement with Otto and his own opponents in Venice because he lost his anti-Otto supporters on the mainland and the Byzantines, who had supported resistance to Otto, were routed in Sicily in 965. Betrolini notes that it is difficult to ascertain which of the two interpretations is more likely due to uncertainties regarding the chronology of the main events (Pietro's attacks on the two towns, his marriage to Waldrada and Otto's pardon of Waldrada's father) and the identification of Vitale Candiano.Staley Edgcumbe had a different take regarding the repudiation of Giovanniccia. She had been a divorcee (which was frowned upon in those days) and she was originally Pietro's mistress whom he took into the Doge's Palace when he ousted his father. This was a scandal and Pietro eventually yielded to the popular feelings and forced her to take a vow of chastity and go to the monastery. Giovanniccia disowned the child she had with Pietro, Vitale, and gave him for fostering. He was then put in a monastery. In 987 he became the bishop of Aquileia. However, this take does not take into account the fact that Pietro married Giovanniccia. During his third expedition to Italy (965-66), Otto I decided to define his relationship with the duchy Venice in the context of settling the situation in Italy. In 967  Otto I renewed the old Pactum Lotharii between the duchy of Venice and the Kingdom of Italy, which defined the boundaries of the duchy and its economic relations with the kingdom. The treaty dated back to 840 and thus it was 127 years old. This constituted a marked restriction compared to the further concessions the Venetians had gained later. There was a reduction of the territory of the duchy. It lost Brondolo and Fossone, to the south of the Lagoon of Venice. Both were important for their saltworks and were on the inland trade waterways of the rivers Brenta and Adige. The border north of Cittanova, from where the routes to northern Europe started, was no longer defined, which led to disputes and to a long fight that doge Pietro II Orseolo (991-1009) undertook in 995–96 against the belligerent bishop of Belluno. A new tax which increased the tax burden on goods was introduced.In 971 the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimisces imposed a ban on the sale military material (wood and weapons) to the Arabs. Ships that breached this and the men and goods they carried would be burned. This was aimed against the Fatimid Caliphate, as a war between the empire and the califate broke out again in that year.  Pietro complied, but this undermined Venice's economic interests as trade with the Arab coast of North Africa, which was short of wood, was an important part of Venetian trade. Wood for furnishing was excluded from the ban, but this was of little relief. The ban was not instituted by a decree of the doge, but by an oath (carta promissiones) by the popular assembly to abstain from the banned acts with a penal clause regarding breaches chosen freely by the assembly. The fact that the ban was adopted by the will of the popular assembly, rather than by a ducal decree crystallised the gulf that had developed between the doge and the people and the isolation of the former from the latter. Cessi sees this as a legislative overturning. It was a precursor to the shift in the balance of power between the doge and the people which was to lead to the formation of the Venetian Republic in the 12th century and the custom of the doge giving a ducal promissio (promissio domini ducis), an oath, on assuming power to be loyal to the Republic and to recognise the limitations to his powers created by the Republic. In 976 the people of Venice rebelled against Pietro. Betrolini argues that there was discontent with Pietro's foreign policy. The relations with Otto I led to economic sacrifices. The economic repercussions of the Byzantine ban increased animosity. His favouritism for his relatives was disliked. Norwich sees Pietro having become too powerful as the cause. His acquisition, though his wife's dowry, of  personal estates on the mainland under the vassalage of the emperor made him look like a mainland feudal lord, which was alien to the Venetians. His living isolated from the people with a bodyguard of mercenaries hired from his mainland possessions and his manoeuvring to acquire family control of the top of the church made him all-powerful. When he asked the Venetians to help him to defend his personal interests in the Ferrara area, the rebellion broke out.Staley Edgcumbe wrote that the rebellion was due to the fact that both the doge and his wife were disliked and too powerful. They were seen as being haughty and living in “proud and contentious isolation.” Waldrada was seen as being petulant and the fact that she was accompanied by Florentine guards was disliked. Pietro was seen as being vainglorious and treated the nobles and officials with “coldness and disdain”. He had a retinue of Tuscans and Greeks and Germans. He also formed a clique of members of the branches of his family form Padua and Vicenza whose power was a threat to the established order.    In 973 the Doge's Palace was attacked. Since the palace was like a fortress, it was set alight. The doge was forced to come out and he was killed, together with his young son Pietro by Waldrada, by some notables (among whom there were some of his relatives). Their bodies were thrown in the slaughterhouse, but were later recovered and buried in the monastery of Sant'Ilario, in Fusina, on the mainland coast of the Lagoon of Venice, perhaps because Pietro owned large estates in the area. Two previous doges, Agnello e Giustiniano Partecipazio, who founded the monastery, were also buried there.As the fire spread, some 300 buildings were destroyed, including the churches of St Mark's, the old San Teodoro,  and the newly completed Santa Maria Zobenigo.Waldrada managed to escape the attack, taking her young daughter Marina with her. She fled to the empress Adelaide, the mother of the new emperor, Otto II, in Verona. She appealed to Otto II to set fire to Venice and imprison its people. She demanded the  reconstitution of her dowry. The new doge, Pietro I Orseolo, sent an envoy to Piacenza to discuss her claim with Otto III. These were amended in a way that satisfied both parties (Pietro IV had introduced the Mundio, a custom which was new in Venice, in which the doge conferred one fourth of his personal assets to his wife; Venice had confiscated Pietro's freehold estates). Waldrada issued a receipt (carta securitatis) to the new doge and the Venetian people.Marina married Tribuno Memmo, who was doge in 979–991.   "
"Vitale Candiano (died 979) was the 24th doge of the Republic of Venice. [SEP]     He was the fourth son of the 21st doge, Pietro III Candiano, and Arcielda Candiano (sometimes given as Richielda). His brother the 22nd Doge Pietro IV and his young heir Pietro V had been killed in the revolution. He was elected by the popular assembly in September 978. This after having to flee to Saxony because of the revolt against his father. His predecessor Pietro I Orseolo had left Venice to become a monk. He voluntarily abdicated after serving as Doge for 14 months, which allowed his niece's husband to become the next Doge. His daughter Maria Candiano married Pietro II Orseolo.    At times, the relationship between Venice and Western Empire was rocky because, in 976, Venetian citizens revolted and killed Doge Peter IV Candiano. He was a despotic leader, but the Western Emperor, Otto II, supported him and he was related by his second marriage to both Otto II's family and that of the King of Italy.    Fourteen months after being elected, Vitale Candiano abdicated, for health reasons. He withdrew to the convent of Sant'Ilario to live monastic life. He died there only four days later and was buried there.   "
"Tribuno Memmo (died 991) was the 25th Doge of Venice who served from 979 to 991. [SEP]    He was illiterate and according to preserved documents, he signed via signum manus. He was rich, partly due to marriage to dogaressa Marina Candiano, daughter of the 22nd Doge Pietro IV Candiano. They had a son, Maurizio. It seems that he had only moved into the Ducal Palace toward the end of his dogeship. It was still in repairs following the fire which occurred during the overthrow of Pietro IV Candiano. During his dogeship, St Mark's Basilica became by decree a ducal property, a sort of private chapel in which the ecclesiastical functions were delegated to the primicerius. On 7 June 983, Emperor Otto II renewed the commercial privileges that had already been enjoyed by many previous Doges. He died in 991 and was succeeded by Pietro II Orseolo.   "
"Pietro II Orseolo (961 − 1009) was the Doge of Venice from 991 to 1009. [SEP] He began the period of eastern expansion of Venice that lasted for the better part of 500 years. He secured his influence in the Dalmatian Romanized settlements from the Croats and Narentines, freed Venetia from a 50-year-old taxation to the latter, and started Venetia's expansions by conquering the islands of Lastovo (Lagosta) and Korčula (Curzola) and acquiring Dubrovnik (Ragusa).       In 992 Pietro II Orseolo concluded a treaty with the Byzantine emperor Basil II to transport Byzantine troops in exchange for commercial privileges in Constantinople. His dogaressa was Maria Candiano.Following repeated complaints by the Dalmatian city-states in 997, the Venetian fleet under Orseolo attacked the Neretvian pirates of Neretva on Ascension Day in 998. Pietro then took the title of Dux Dalmatianorum (Duke of the Dalmatians), associating it with his son Giovanni Orseolo.    On 9 May 1000 Doge Pietro II decided to finally pacify the Croatians and the Narentines during the last Croatian-Bulgarian wars, protecting Venetian trade colonies and the interests of Romanized Dalmatians. Without difficulties, his fleet of six ships scorched the entire eastern half of the Adriatic coast, with only the Neretvians offering resistance. After the Neretvians stole goods and captured forty tradars from Zadar, the Doge dispatched ten ships that caught the Neretvians near the island of Kača. He captured them all and brought them triumphantly to Split. There, Neretvian emissaries requested the release of the prisoners.  Pietro II agreed provided that the Neretvian Archont himself agreed to bow before him. Moreover, the Neretvians would also have to renounce the old tax that Venetia had to pay since 948, and guarantee safe passage to Venetian ships in the Adriatic. Pietro II released all prisoners except for six Narentines, whom he kept as hostages. The mainland Narentines were thus pacified; the citizens of Korčula decided to wage war against Orseolo, but were eventually conquered.  Lastovo however, continued to resist Venetian incursions. The island was infamous for being a pirate haven. In the effort to decisively quell further opposition, Pietro II ordered the evacuation of the island city. Despite continuing opposition, he eventually razed Lastovo to the ground. At the same time that Pietro II subjugated Lastovo, the former Croatian king Svetoslav Suronja fled to Venice after being deposed by his two brothers. To bolster his weakened position, King Stephen I of Croatia married Pietro II Orseolo's daughter, Joscella (Hicela) Orseolo. Their son Peter Krešimir IV became king in Croatia in 1059. Pietro II Orseolo was married to Maria Candiano, the daughter of Vitale Candiano and niece of Doge Pietro IV Candiano. Ottone Orseolo succeeded his father, Pietro II, as the doge of Venice until 1026, while his grandson Peter reigned as King of Hungary. His younger son Domenico Orseolo's children settled in Ravenna and became the stem of the Orsini family.    The date of his victory became that of the Festa della Sensa, the Ascension Festival, the oldest festival in Venice. It was commemorated by the Doge and the bishop of Olivolo going past the Lido and blessing the waters, invoking good fortune for the Venetian navy.   "
"Orso II Participazio (died 932) was the eighteenth doge of the Republic of Venice, by tradition (historically, he was the sixteenth), from 912 to 932. [SEP]    In 912 he was kidnapped in the Adriatic by a Serb prince of Zachlumia by the name of Mihailo Višević while returning with the Doge's son from an official visit to Constantinople. Bulgaria was at war with Byzantium, the sovereign of Venice, so the coastal prince, who was a Bulgarian ally, dispatched him to Emperor Simeon I of Bulgaria, hoping he would push off Petar Gojniković's domination in the area. He was elected by the popular assembly. It seems that he was not related to the Participazio family that had already given many doges to the city. (There was a prior Orso II Participazio who vied for dogeship in about 887 but appears to have been entirely unrelated.) As soon as elected, he sent his son Pietro to Constantinople in order to re-establish the relationships with the Byzantine emperor, which his predecessors had neglected. Pietro was named protospatharios, which was corrupted to Baduario and, eventually, to Badoer (pronounced “Badoèr”), which became a prominent name among successive generations of Venetian nobility. The Adriatic was still plagued by Dalmatian, Saracen, and Narentine pirates, but the Doge took no action.  Under his leadership, Venice acquired a mint. In 932, he withdrew to the monastery of Saint Felice in Ammiana, where he led a monastic life until his death. He was buried there. His portrait is placed in the church of the Madonna of the Garden.   "

"Maria Argyra or Maria Argyropoulina (Greek:   or ; died 1007) was the granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor Romanos II and niece of the emperors Basil II and Constantine VIII. [SEP] In the Venetian Chronicle by John the Deacon, it is mentioned that Maria was the daughter of a noble patrician, called Argyropoulos, who was a descendant of the imperial family. This information is confirmed by the chronicle of Andrea Dandolo, who says that she was the niece of the emperor Basil II. As a member of the Argyros family Maria was also relative to the future Byzantine emperor Romanos III Argyros. In 1004 Maria was married to Giovanni Orseolo, the son of the Doge of Venice Pietro II Orseolo, in the Iconomium palace in Constantinople with full imperial pageantry - the couple was crowned with golden diadems by Basil II. Maria brought to her husband great dowry, including a palace in the imperial capital, where they lived after the wedding. Basil also honored Maria's husband with the title of patrician. Before they left Constantinople, Maria Argyra begged the emperor for pieces of the holy relics of Saint Barbara, which were brought to Venice by her. Maria Argyre and Giovanni Orseolo had a son, who was named after emperor Basil II. In 1007 Maria along her husband and son died when plague swept through the city-state. Half a century after her death, she was probably the ""wife of a doge"" alluded to by Peter Damian criticizing her use of fork, perfumes and dew for bathing.   "
"Felicia Cornaro (died 1111), was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Vitale I Michiel (r. 1096-1102). She was politically active and exerted an acknowledged influence over the affairs of state. [SEP] She was a strong supporter of the First Crusade.    She is described as an ideal of simplicity, virtue and modesty for the women of Venice, in contrast to what had been the case with the previous dogaressa, Theodora Anna Doukaina Selvo.   During the First Crusade, she organised the funds necessary to establish hospitals, beds and food for the pilgrims and crusaders, and set an example by selling her jewelry and clothes and cutting down the representation of the doge court life.   She also encouraged the mothers to send their sons away to serve in the crusade.   In 1099, the Venetians financed an escort fleet to protect the crusaders on their way to Syria. The influence of Felicia upon the affairs of state was common knowledge: Mathilda of Tuscany asked Felicia to persuade Venice to assist her to pacify the rebellious Ferrara, something Felicia also successfully did.

"Theodora Doukaina (Greek:  ) (before 1059– after 1075) was a Byzantine princess and dogaressa. [SEP]    She was the second daughter of Byzantine emperor Constantine X Dukas and his second wife Eudokia Makrembolitissa. After 1071 she became the wife of Domenico Selvo, Doge of Venice, who received the title of protoproedros at the occasion.As she is mentioned as alive in the work of Michael Psellos (1075), it is assumed she died after this last date. It is not known if she had children, and she is not mentioned otherwise.    Peter Damian, the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, wrote a chapter entitled ""De Veneti ducis uxore quae prius nimium delicata, demum toto corpore computruit"" (""Of the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away."") about an unnamed Byzantine princess whose manners he considered scandalously lavish and which brought to her a horrible death as a divine punishment.  This woman has been mistakenly (since Damian died 1072) identified with Domenico Selvo's wife by later Venetian chroniclers (incl. Andrea Dandolo and Marino Sanudo the Younger) followed afterwards by various modern authors; however since the work in which Damianus' chapter is contained is dated ca 1059 it refers probably to Maria Argyropoulaina who had died a half century before.

"Pietro Barbolano (sometimes Pietro Barbo Centranigo) was the 28th Doge of Venice. [SEP] Reportedly a descendant of the legendary Eraclea (after whom the town near Venice is named), he was elected by the assembly of the nobles after the deposition of his predecessor, Otto Orseolo. The dates of his birth and death are unknown.    Barbolano's reign occurred during a rather difficult time in Venice. The people had spoken out against hereditary monarchy when they deposed Otto Orseolo following the scandals over nepotism. He was never fully able to win over the Venetians as he was not nearly as charismatic as the two previous Doges from the Orseolo family.  For the four years of his reign, he struggled to bring the city back together, but he could not. Because the Orseoli had created so many links between their family and the hereditary ruling dynasties of Europe, various actions were taken against Venice as a retaliation for deposing Otto Orseolo. The Byzantine Emperor not only took Otto Orseolo in as a relative (in fact, he was), but he also withdrew the trading privileges granded to Pietro Orseolo in 992. He tried to obtain from the Holy Roman Emperor, Conrad II, a renewal of Venetian commercial privileges that had been granted to them by Otto III, but he was not able to do so. In the meantime, King Stephen of Hungary, whose sister Grimelda of Hungary was the wife of Otto Orseolo, attacked Dalmatia and annexed a number of cities that had been captured by Pietro II. The Republic appeared to be collapsing and many people went back to supporting Otto Orseolo, though not the Orseolo family as hereditary rulers. In 1032, Pietro Barbolano abdicated under heavy pressure and Otto Orseolo was called back to rule from his exile in Constantinople. However, when the messengers got there, Otto was approaching his death causing Domenico Orseolo, his relative in Venice, to attempt to seize power. This bold action was extremely ill-received in Venice as the populace displayed its animosity for the notion that an Orseolo was somehow entitled to the Dogeship. Barbolano's successor was chosen in 1032 to be the wealthy merchant Domenico Flabanico, who had few noble ties, to spite the idea of creating a royal family in Venice.   "
"Domenico Contarini (Birthdate unknown, died 1071 in Venice) was the 30th Doge of Venice. [SEP] His reign lasted from his election following the death of Domenico Flabanico in 1043 until his own death in 1071. During his reign, the Venetians recaptured Zadar and parts of Dalmatia that had been lost to the Kingdom of Croatia in the previous few decades. The Venetian naval fleet was heavily built up during his reign, the economy thrived, and the Republic of Venice had reasserted its control over much of the Mediterranean Sea.    The Contarini were one of the oldest Venetian families whose origins are often linked to the beginning of the city itself. The first historically verified documentation of the Contarini shows up in 960. Over the centuries, the family had branched out and rooted itself in over 20 familial lines. Domenico was the first Doge of the Contarini family. By 1797, when the last Doge reigned, the family would produce 8 Doges of their own, including Domenico.    After the capture of Zadar, Venice entered an era of peace. Domenico Contarini maintained friendly relations with the Byzantine Emperors, the Pope in Rome, and the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry III. Contarini was a liberal builder of churches and monasteries, such as San Nicolò di Lido in Lido di Venezia and Sant'Angelo di Concordia. In 1071, just before his death, he commissioned builders to begin work on expanding and restoring St Mark's Basilica. By his wish, he was buried at the church of San Nicolò al Lido when he died in 1071. His tomb is above the main doorway, surmounted by a portrait bust which shows him wearing the ""corno,"" the distinctive doge's hat.  His son, Enrico Contarini, was Bishop of Castello from 1074 to 1108. Enrico Contarini was the spiritual leader of an expedition to the Holy Land in 1099-1100 that brought back the  remains of Saint Nicholas and Saint Theodore the Martyr.   "
"Vitale Faliero Dodoni (also known as Falier de' Doni) and usually known in English as Vitale Falier was the 32nd Doge of Venice from 1084 until his death in 1095. [SEP]    He was a member of a noble Venetian family, probably from Fano. A member of the minor consiglio (the council of doge's advisers), he was elected Doge in the revolt that overthrew Domenico Selvo in December 1084, probably initiated by Faliero himself, among others. He is the first Doge whose image is known, being allegedly portrayed next to the high altar of St. Mark's Basilica. When he became Doge, Venice was supporting the Byzantine Empire in the war against the Normans under Robert Guiscard (see Siege of Durazzo). In the spring of 1095, the Venetian fleet obtained a great naval victory at Butrinthos (in modern-day Albania) that avenged Selvo's defeat at Corfu. The recovery in the prestige of the city is testified by the visit of Emperor Henry IV, to whom it was allied during the Investiture Controversy against the pope, for the consecration of St. Mark's church, the rebuilding of which was completed at this time. During the latter part of his reign the city was hit by an earthquake, a seastorm, and a heavy famine. Faliero died in December 1095. He was married to Cornella Bembo. His son Ordelafo became a subsequent Doge.   "
"Domenico Flabanico (died 1043) was the 29th Doge of Venice. [SEP] His reign lasted from the abdication of Pietro Barbolano in 1032 until his death. Before Domenico Flabanico took office, there was a significant chaos in Venice. His predecessor had abdicated the position of Doge following extensive public pressure to reinstate Otto Orseolo, but when it was found out that Otto Orseolo was dying, Domenico Orseolo, Otto's less popular relative, attempted to seize the dogeship. There was great public outcry in Venice regarding the apparent onset of a nepotistic hereditary monarchy. Flabanico, a successful merchant and popular individual, but less than noble, was elected to spite the notion of royal blood. Under Flabanico, new laws were instilled to limit the powers of the Doge against creating a hereditary monarchy and passing many new acts. In this time, Venice went through a period of infighting and decline. Flabanico was hardly capable of maintaining the diplomatic relationships that were necessary for adequate foreign policy and he let the economy of the Republic of Venice slip due to a general decline in confidence of the Republic. It was only thanks to his successor, Domenico Contarini, that the Republic was restored to a new era of prosperity. He died in 1043, marking the end of more than a decade of rule.

"Vital I Michiel (died 1102) was a Doge of Venice; he was the 33rd traditional (30th historic) Doge of the Republic of Venice. [SEP] A member of one of the so-called “twelve apostolic” families, he was married to Felicia Cornaro, who had influence on his politics.    When Pope Urban II initiated the First Crusade, Vitale I Michiel did not initially urge Venice’s support, perhaps because he could not see the advantages to Venice of such an expedition. The leader of the crusade, Godfrey of Bouillon (Goffredo di Buglione), along with his older brother, Eustace III of Boulogne, and younger brother Baldwin, left southern Italy in August 1096, with a contingent of 120 ships and (legendarily) 40,000 troops from all over Europe. When Doge Vitale I Michiel saw the European commitment to the First Crusade, he then understood the war’s economic importance. In particular, he foresaw that it was vital to Venice’s trade advantage to participate in territorial conquest, lest these advantages inure to the benefit of other marine republics. In July 1099, 207 ships sailed from Venice to support the First Crusade. Doge Vitale I Michiel appointed his son, Vitale Giovanni, and the Bishop of Castello, Enrico Contarini, as the fleet’s commanders. In December 1099, at Rhodes, the Venetian fleet intercepted enemy ships and sank them. In the spring of 1100, the Venetian fleet headed towards the Levant, where in the meantime, Godfrey of Bouillon and his troops had taken Jerusalem. Enemy ships had cut off Godfrey’s ability to receive aid and he was forced to negotiate with the Venetians. In exchange for its services, Venice obtained the right to maintain a quarter not subject to custom offices, taxes, or excise taxes in every conquered city or territory. In 1101, Vitale I Michiele interceded in favor of Mathilde of Tuscany in regards to the purchase of Ferrara, and obtained generous trade concessions as a result. He died in the spring of 1102 and was buried at St. Mark’s Basilica.   "
"Otto Orseolo (Italian: Ottone Orseolo, also Urseolo; c. 992−1032) was the Doge of Venice from 1008 to 1026. [SEP] He was the third son of Pietro II Orseolo and Maria Candiano, whom he succeeded at the age of sixteen, becoming the youngest doge in Venetian history.    When the Emperor Otto III sojourned in Verona and granted many privileges to Venice in the March of Verona, he requested Pietro to send his third son to Verona, where the Emperor acted as his sponsor at his confirmation. In the Emperor's honour, he was given the name Otto. In 1004, Pietro Otto, in the company of his eldest son and co-doge Giovanni, traveled to Constantinople, where Giovanni married the niece of Basil II, Maria Argyra, and Otto received several honorific titles.After Giovanni's sudden death (1006), Pietro raised Otto to the dogeship with him. He then made a testament, giving the majority of his wealth to the poor and the Church, and retired to a monastery, leaving Otto the government. When Pietro finally died in 1008, he left Otto sole doge at the meager age of sixteen. Soon after the death of his father, in 1009, Otto married Grimelda, a daughter of the newly Christian Géza of Hungary and Adelaide. Because the Chronicon Venetum of John the Deacon ends in Otto's reign, it is necessary to rely on later chronicles. According to the chronicler (and doge) Andrea Dandolo, writing from a vantage point three centuries ahead, Otto was:  Catholic in faith, calm in purity, strong in justice, eminent in religion, decorous in his manner of life, well-endowed with wealth and possessions, and so filled with all forms of virtue that he was universally considered to be the most fitting successor of his father and grandfather.    Scandal marked much of Otto's reign, as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism with the elevation of several relatives to positions of power. In 1017, Vitale Candiano, the Patriarch of Grado, died and Otto appointed his elder brother (Pietro's second son), Orso, already Bishop of Torcello, to the vacant patriarchate. Otto then filled the vacant Torcello with his younger brother Vitale. These actions lost him the support of the people, though they did not yet clamour for his removal from office. The denunciations of Poppo of Treffen, the Patriarch of Aquileia, incited the Venetians to expel Otto and the patriarch of Grado from Venice, whence they took refuge in Istria from 1022 to 1023. But in that latter year, Poppo sacked the patriarchal palace and church in Grado and the Venetians recalled Otto and Orso.In 1024, Pope John XIX confirmed Orso's right to hold Grado and confirmed the patriarchal rights of his see vis-à-vis Aquileia. However, Otto continued to use church appointments to his own personal and familial advantage and the enemies of the Orseoli in Venice, with popular support, moved to depose him in 1026. They arrested him, shaved his beard, and banished him to Constantinople. There he was well received by Constantine VIII, the uncle of his sister-in-law, who repealed trade privileges previously granted to the Republic under Pietro II. Not for nothing had Otto built up a good rapport with the emperors of Europe: the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II likewise revoked Venetian trade privileges in response to his deposition. Stephen I of Croatia, at the instigation of Otto's son Pietro, attacked the coastal cities of Dalmatia, capturing several from Venice.    Meanwhile, the Venetians had grown sick of Otto's successor, Pietro Barbolano, and they deposed him in turn (1032). Vitale of Torcello went to Constantinople to seek out his brother to reassume the ducal throne, while Orso of Grado took the government in his own hands in the interim. Vitale arrived in the Byzantine capital to find Otto on the verge of death and he died before he could return to Venice. Orso resigned the temporal power as soon as news reached Venice, while a relative, Domenico, tried to usurp the throne. He failed and the Venetians turned to one Domenico Flabanico to be their doge. Otto's son Pietro later succeeded Stephen as King of Hungary. Otto had two daughters, Frozza Orseolo and Felicia Orseolo, who married Nicolo Bembo. Their daughter Elena Bembo married Zuane Michiel, son of Vitale Michiel and Felicia Elena Cornaro, and their son was Domenico Michiel.   "
"Domenico Selvo (died 1087) was the 31st Doge of Venice, serving from 1071 to 1084. [SEP]  During his reign as Doge, his domestic policies, the alliances that he forged, and the battles that the Venetian military won and lost laid the foundations for much of the subsequent foreign and domestic policy of the Republic of Venice. He avoided confrontations with the Byzantine Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Roman Catholic Church at a time in European history when conflict threatened to upset the balance of power. At the same time, he forged new agreements with the major nations that would set up a long period of prosperity for the Republic of Venice. Through his military alliance with the Byzantine Empire, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos awarded Venice economic favors with the declaration of a golden bull that would allow for the development of the republic's international trade over the next few centuries. Within the city itself, he supervised a longer period of the construction of the modern St Mark's Basilica than any other Doge. The basilica's complex architecture and expensive decorations stand as a testament to the prosperity of Venetian traders during this period. The essentially democratic way in which he not only was elected but also removed from power was part of an important transition of Venetian political philosophy.  The overthrow of his rule in 1084 was one of many forced abdications in the early history of the republic that further blurred the lines between the powers of the Doge, the common electorate, and the nobility.     Beginning with the reign of Pietro II Candiano in 932, Venice saw a string of inept leaders such as Pietro III Candiano, Pietro IV Candiano, and Tribuno Memmo. The reputed arrogance and ambition of these Doges caused the deterioration of the relationship with the Holy Roman Empire in the west, the stagnancy of the relationship with the Byzantine Empire in the east, and discord at home in the Republic. However, in 991, Pietro II Orseolo became the Doge and spent his reign pushing the boundaries of the Republic further east down the western coast of the Balkan Peninsula with his conquests in Dalmatia in 1000. This strengthened the commercial bonds with the empires of the east, Sicily, Northern Africa, and the Holy Roman Empire, and put an end to the infighting among the citizens of Venice. Pietro II's negotiations with Byzantine Emperor Basil II to decrease tariffs on Venetian-produced goods helped foster a new age of prosperity in the Republic as Venetian merchants could undercut the competition in the international markets of the Byzantine Empire. Similarly, Pietro II had success developing a new relationship with Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, who displayed his friendship to him by restoring previously seized lands to Venice, opening up routes of free trade between the two states, and exempting all Venetians from taxes in the Holy Roman Empire.As the power and reputation of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people began to wonder if he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history at the age of 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.In 1032, Barbolano himself was deposed by those who wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople and was unable to return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, attempted to seize the throne without waiting for the formality of an election, but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because he was the son of Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of a son of a Doge.Doge Domenico Contarini (1043–1071) had a relatively uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory that had been lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in the years following the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions in the first half of the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.       What little is known of Selvo's past is based mostly on accounts of his reputation when he entered his Dogeship.  Details of his family origins and even the year of his birth are unknown, but it can be assumed that he was a Venetian noble because, with the rare exception of Domenico Flabanico, only members of this class were elected to the position of Doge at this point in the Republic's history. Selvo supposedly belonged to a family in the patrician class from the sestiere of Dorsoduro who were allegedly of ancient Roman origin, possibly from one of the tribunes. He had also apparently been an ambassador to Holy Roman Emperor Henry III and he was certainly ducal counselor to Domenico Contarini prior to his election as Doge. Being connected to the relatively popular Doge might have been one of the causes for his own apparent initial popularity.     Selvo is notable for being the first Doge in the history of Venice whose election was recorded by an eyewitness, a parish priest of the church of San Michele Archangelo by the name of Domenico Tino. The account gives historians a valuable glimpse of the power of the popular will of the Venetian people. Over the previous two centuries, the rule of quasi-tyrannies had plagued the popular belief that Venetians held democratic control over their leaders. The events of Selvo's election occurred in the spring of 1071, when the nearly thirty-year reign of Doge Domenico Contarini came to an end upon his death.According to Tino's account, on the day of the election, Selvo was attending mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons. After the funeral, a large crowd assembled in their gondolas and armed galleys. Domenico Tino says ""an innumerable multitude of people, virtually all Venice"" was there to voice their opinion on the selection of a new Doge. After the bishop of Venice asked ""who would be worthy of his nation,"" the crowds chanted, ""Domenicum Silvium volumus et laudamus"" (We want Domenico Selvo and we praise him). The people, according to the account, had clearly spoken, and with these cries, the election was over. A group of more distinguished citizens then lifted the Doge-elect above the roaring crowd, and he was transported as such back to the city. Barefoot, in accordance with tradition, Selvo was led into St Mark's Basilica where, amidst the construction materials and scaffolding, he prayed to God, received his staff of office, heard the oaths of fidelity from his subjects, and was legally sworn in as the 31st Doge of Venice.    During the first decade of his rule, Selvo's policies were largely a continuation of those of Domenico Contarini.  There were few armed conflicts at home or abroad, and the Doge enjoyed a period of popularity due to the prosperous economic conditions. The relations with the Holy Roman Empire were gradually strengthened to a level unknown since the reign of the last Orseolo through relatively free trade and the good relationship that Selvo maintained with Emperor Henry IV. The importance of the economic alliance between the two nations became increasingly crucial when the historically shared power of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope was challenged by the Investiture Controversy between Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. Selvo had to walk an extremely tight line of competing priorities. On the one hand, he wanted to maintain the trade agreement Venice had with the lands occupied by Henry IV, but on the other hand, Venetians were religiously loyal to Roman Catholicism as opposed to the Eastern Orthodoxy. At the height of the controversy, Pope Gregory VII privately threatened to excommunicate Selvo and put an interdict on the Venetian Republic, but Selvo was able to narrowly escape this by diplomatically asserting Venice's religious power as the reputed holders of the remains of St Mark.In the east, Selvo not only maintained good trade relations with the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family to consolidate the alliance that had existed for many years between the two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Theodora Doukas, daughter of Constantine X and sister of the reigning emperor, Michael VII. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though the popularity of the new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.     Despite the relative peace of the early years of Selvo's reign, the forces that would eventually lead to his deposition had already swung into action. In southern Italy, the Duke of Apulia and Calabria, Robert Guiscard, had spent the majority of his reign consolidating Norman power along the heel and toe of lo Stivale by expelling the Byzantine armies.  Guiscard was pushing north toward the Papal States (to which the Duchy of Apulia and Calabria was allied), and was threatening Byzantine control of cities along the Ionian and Adriatic seas. In May 1081, Guiscard led his army and navy across the sea to lay siege to the port city of Durazzo, as it was one end of the famous Via Egnatia, a direct route to the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. Alexios I Komnenos, the newly crowned Byzantine Emperor, dispatched an urgent message to Selvo asking for the mobilization of the Venetian fleet in defense of Durazzo in return for great rewards. The Doge wasted no time in setting sail for the besieged city in charge of his fleet of 14 warships and 45 other vessels. Selvo was motivated not only by his familial ties and the promise of reward, but also the realization that Norman control over the Strait of Otranto would be just as great of a threat to Venetian power in the region as it would be to their ally in the east.When Selvo approached the city, Guiscard's ships had already anchored in the harbor at Durazzo. Though the battle was fierce, superior tactics by the skilled Venetian fleet overpowered the inexperienced Normans who were mostly used to land battles. The battered fleet led by Guiscard retreated into the harbor after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet under the command of his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice was awarded a Golden Bull: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a tax exemption for Venetian merchants, that would be crucial for the future economic and political expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean.The defeat off the coast of Durazzo, though devastating to Guiscard's fleet, had inflicted little damage to his army as the majority of it had disembarked before the battle in preparation of the siege of Durazzo. In the coming months, Guiscard would regroup his forces and defeat a large Byzantine army led by Alexios I himself. In 1082, Guiscard took the city of Durazzo, and as the Venetian sailors were forced out of the city and their ships vacated the harbor of Durazzo, the first victory by Venice against the Norman fleet appeared just a temporary setback for the Normans. Due to the new trade privileges and the fact that virtually no damage was inflicted on the Venetians during this siege, Selvo remained very popular in Venice. Meanwhile, Guiscard advanced rapidly across the Balkan Peninsula, but his march was halted by an urgent dispatch and a call for help from his greatest ally, Pope Gregory VII. Guiscard responded by returning to Italy and marching on Rome to temporarily expel Henry IV, but in the process, he lost almost all the territories he had gained in the Balkans. Knowing that Guiscard was gone, in 1083, Selvo sent the Venetian fleet to recapture both Durazzo and the island of Corfu to the south.     In 1084, Guiscard returned to the Balkans and planned a new offensive against Corfu, where a combined Greek-Venetian fleet, commanded by Selvo, awaited his arrival. When the Normans approached the island, the combined fleets dealt Guiscard an even greater defeat than he had received in the naval battle at Durazzo. Guiscard ordered another attack three days later, but the results were still more disastrous for the Normans. Selvo was completely convinced of his fleet's victory and sent all damaged ships north to Venice for repairs, to free them for other uses, and to report of their victory. The Doge then retired with the remaining ships to the Albanian coast to await the departure of the Normans. Acting on the Doge's belief that a third attack would be unlikely and that the presence of a slightly depleted Venetian fleet meant greater odds for victory, Guiscard summoned every floating vessel he could find and led the Normans into a surprise attack. His strategy, though perhaps risky, was ultimately well-calculated as it caused mass confusion among the Venetians, who were overwhelmed on all flanks, while the Greeks fled what they assumed to be a losing battle. Selvo barely managed to retreat with the remainder of his fleet, but not before 3,000 Venetians died and another 2,500 were taken prisoner. The Venetians also lost 9 great galleys, the largest and most heavily armed ships in their war fleet.When the battered fleet returned to Venice, news of the defeat spread throughout the city to mixed reactions. Though some were willing to forgive the defeat considering the circumstances, many others needed someone to blame for the loss that was considerable not only in human and material terms, but also symbolically. The people of Venice had been humiliated by an upstart nation with practically no naval experience. Though Guiscard would die the next year and the Norman threat would quickly disappear, a scapegoat was needed at that moment. A faction of influential Venetians, possibly led by Vitale Faliero based on later writings, led a popular revolt to depose Selvo, and in December 1084 they succeeded. Selvo apparently did not make a great effort to defend himself and was sent off to a monastery. He died three years later in 1087, and was buried in the loggiato of St. Mark's Basilica.    The Emperor flung open to them the gates of the Orient. On that day, Venetian world trade began. After Selvo was deposed, it took several years for Venice to recover from the defeat at Corfu and for the Venetians to fully realize the immediate impact of his actions as Doge. When Venice provided military aid to the Byzantine Empire, they were awarded a Golden Bull by Emperor Alexios I that would provide the Venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout the eastern empire for centuries. According to the terms of the decree, annual grants were awarded to all the churches in Venice (including a special gift to the coffers of St Mark's), the Republic was granted whole sections of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, and Venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all taxes and duties throughout the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Not only did this aid the rapid economic growth of Venice in the next few centuries by giving Venetian goods a significant price advantage over other foreign goods, but it initiated a long period of artistic, cultural, and military relationships between Venice and Byzantium. This combination of eastern and western cultural influences made Venice a symbolic gateway between the east and the west in Southern Europe.  At the beginning of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's Basilica. This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also a monument to the great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee the beginning or completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule covered a longer period of its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project. The Doge decreed that all Venetian merchants returning from the east had to bring back marbles or fine carvings to decorate St Mark's. The first mosaics were started in the basilica under the supervision of Selvo.By gaining power through a vote of confidence from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that was in the process of moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.

He was a member of the Minor Council (minor consiglio), an assembly formed from members of the so-called ""apostolic families"" that, in oligarchical Venice, assumed the governmental functions of judges, military councilmen, ambassadors and heads of state. His first name, which is otherwise unknown in Venetian history, is thought to have been derived from a backwards spelling of the Venetian name ""Faledro"", or from the Ordelaffi family, of which the Faliero family is thought to be a stirpe. During his reign as Doge, Faliero went to war against the Hungarians, ruled at the time by Coloman, which lasted from 1105 to 1115.  Faliero succeeded in recapturing Zara and Sebenico. Afterwards, Faliero was engaged in an expedition to Syria, comprising 100 Venetian ships, which succeeded in conquering a part of Acre.  Objects from the local Syrian convent of Christ Pantocrator were taken back to Saint Mark's Basilica. In Venice, Faliero established the nucleus of what would become the Arsenal.

"Orio Mastropiero (died 13 June 1192), forename sometimes rendered as Aurio and surname as Malipiero, was a Venetian statesman who served as Doge of Venice from 1178 to 1192. [SEP] He was elected by the Council of Forty in 1178 following the retirement of Sebastiano Ziani. Prior to this he had been an ambassador to Sicily in 1175, tasked with drawing up a treaty with King William II. He had also been the electors' first choice for Doge following the death of Vitale II Michiel in 1172, but stepped aside in favour of Sebastiano Ziani, an older and wealthier man.His time in office was mostly unremarkable, apart from a revolt against Venetian rule in Zara, supported by King Béla III of Hungary. For a long while Venice remained passive, being in financial difficulty; but took action at last in 1187 or 1188 when, having secured loans from the Venetian nobility, Mastropiero launched a siege against the Zaratines. This was short-lived, however, owing to an order from Pope Gregory VIII that their warring cease immediately: the Third Crusade was about to begin and Christian soldiers would be required in plenty.In May 1192, having taken ill, he abdicated as Doge and retired to the monastery of San Croce. He died there on 13 June 1192.   "
"Domenico Michiel was the 35th Doge of Venice. [SEP] He reigned from 1117 to 1130. In August 1122 Domenico Michiel led a Venetian fleet of 100 vessels and around 15,000 men for the defense of the Holy Land. The fleet sailed under the flag of St. Peter, which the Pope had sent to Michiel. Over the winter the fleet set siege to the Byzantine island of Corfu. The siege was cancelled in the spring when news arrived that King Baldwin II of Jerusalem had been captured by the Artuqids, and that the Kingdom of Jerusalem had subsequently been invaded by the Fatimids of Egypt. The Venetian fleet went to the defense of Jerusalem and defeated the Egyptian fleet off of the Syrian coast. The Venetians then landed at Acre; from there Michiel went to Jerusalem, where the Pactum Warmundi was signed granting Venice privileged trade concessions, tax freedoms, and even partial ownership of some cities within the Kingdom of Jerusalem. On the return journey to Venice, the fleet looted Rhodes, attacked the islands Samos and Lesbos, and destroyed the city of Modon in the Peloponnese. Domenico Michiel triumphantly returned to Venice in June 1125. He had helped the Christians in the Holy Land and weakened the hostile Greeks. The inscription on Michiel's tomb does not describe him as a religious crusader, but rather as a terror Graecorum...et laus Venetorum (""A horror to the Greeks...and praise from the Venetians""). His dogaressa was Alicia."
"Domenico Morosini (died February 1156) was the thirty-seventh doge of the Republic of Venice, reigning from 1148 until his death in 1156. [SEP] Descendant of a noble family (he was a count), Morosini succeeded in reconciling the two factions that had divided Venetian patrician families for years, thus ending a political conflict that had also caused the Republic to lose ground in its territories and primacy in its commercial activities. Quite unexceptional otherwise, Morosini's dogeship was marked by renewed prosperity and reconciliation.    Morosini's early years are difficult to reconstruct, due to the absence of reliable records and sources. As a matter of fact, his birthyear is unknown, as are the activities and connections of his family before his interest in politics. This unusual lack of publicly recorded information is likely because his dukedom was relatively unremarkable in terms of conquests, expansion, and events of significance — historians of the Republic would have had little interest in ""digging up the past"" either to glorify or to marr his legacy. He was married to a woman named Sophia, according to legend a captive from the East.The Morosini had been raised to countship in the late 10th century C.E. after they, with the support of Holy Roman Emperor Otto II, had vanquished the rival Caloprini family.  Domenico brought the family to the forefront of Venetian political life, starting a tradition that would see his successors contribute greatly to the wellbeing of the Republic.  Ruggiero Morosini would be admiral of the Venetian navy that defeated the Genoese in 1298, while Francesco Morosini would defeat the Turks on several occasions, somewhat slowing down the westward progress of the Ottoman Empire in the process.    Morosini took office at a time when relations between Venice and two of its long-time allies, Byzantine Greece and the Normans, were beginning to deteriorate.After the death of his father, emperor Alexios I Komnenos, in 1118, John II Komnenos refused to confirm the 1082 treaty (a chrysobull) with the Republic, which had given it unique and generous trading rights within the Byzantine Empire (there would be no import duties on Venetian shipments to and from the territories of the Empire). An incident involving the abuse of a member of the imperial family by Venetians led to a dangerous conflict, especially as Byzantium had depended on Venice for its naval strength. After a Byzantine retaliatory attack on Kerkyra, John II exiled the Venetian merchants from Constantinople, but this produced further retaliation, and a Venetian fleet of 72 ships plundered Rhodes, Chios, Samos, Lesbos, Andros and captured Kefalonia in the Ionian Sea. Relationships with the Normans deteriorated when Venice supported (through its fleet under Naimero and Giovanni Polani, sons of Morosini's predecessor Pietro Polani) a Byzantine intervention to suppress an uprising at Cape Malea (one of the peninsulas in the southeast of the Peloponnese in Greece) in 1149.The 1148 conquest of the Istrian city of Pula, a key port in the peninsula, was followed by an insurgence which Morosini suppressed with atypical shrewdness: in 1150, reconquered Pula swore allegiance to the Republic of Venice, thus becoming a Venetian possession. For centuries thereafter, the city's fate and fortunes would be tied to those of Venetian power. Morosini's foreign policy sought a rapprochement with the Holy See, which had excommunicated the city of Venice because of its familiarity with the Byzantine Empire (and, thus, its schismatic religion). The doge extended an olive branch to Pope Eugene III by consenting, in 1152, to the independence of the Church within the territories of the Republic — a move that immediately warranted the repeal of the excommunication and, thus, simplified Venetian tradings with Catholic countries.  Further recognition of renewed collaboration came in 1154, when Pope Anastasius IV raised the doge dominator Marchiæ (lit., ""ruler of Marche"").Morosini's reconciliation with the Church had positive effects on domestic policy as well, by bridging a long-standing feud between the Polani and Dandolo patrician families. Enrico Dandolo had been Patriarch of Grado at a particularly tense time between Venice and the pontificate, which had caused the Polani family, strong supporters of the Pope, to break relations with the Dandolos. In an attempt to reconcile the factions that had coalesced around the two families among the patricians, Morosini pushed for a mariage d'affaires between Andrea Dandolo, grandson of Enrico, and Primera Polani, niece of the previous doge.During Morosini's dogeship, the construction of St Mark's Campanile was finally completed.

"Pietro Polani (died 1148) was the 36th Doge of Venice. [SEP]  He reigned from 1130 to 1148. Polani was elected Doge over the protests of the Dandolo and Bado families because of his first marriage to Adelasa Michele, who was the daughter of his predecessor Domenico Michele.  His opponents saw his election to Doge as a violation of a decree that sought to prevent public positions from being passed on through inheritance. Polani's reign was characterized primarily by external threats to the Republic of Venice. Between 1133 and 1135 the Hungarians captured important Venetian bases on the Dalmatian coast, such as Sebenica, Trogir, and Split.  In 1141 Padua tried to expand its territory and influence at the expense of Venice, and tried to subvert the monopoly the Venetians held over the salt trade. At the same time, Ancona was infringing on the Venetian border zone in the south.  The political structure in Venice reacted to the complicated and dangerous situation by establishing  a council of wise men (sapientes) to advise the Doge. The initially informal council included representatives of the previously dominant aristocracy as well as bankers and merchants. This gradually formed a new oligarchy that participated in ruling the state and during the ensuing centuries increasingly restricted the rights of the Doge.  One of the first joint decisions by the sapientes and the Doge was the decision not to participate in the Second Crusade. Venice won new influence in the eastern Mediterranean by assisting the Byzantine Empire against the Italo-Normans led by Roger II of Sicily.  Many of the noble Venetian families were violently opposed to supporting Byzantium, and the Patriarch Enrico Dandolo fulminated against making a pact with the ""schismatic"" East.  But not even an excommunication of Polani by the pope could convince the Venetians to forgo the valuable commercial rights they received in Chios, Cyprus, Rhodes, and Candia (Crete) through their alliance with the Byzantine Empire.  Polani himself commanded the Venetian fleet against the Normans until sickness forced him to return prematurely to Venice where he died soon thereafter.  The fleet went on without him to decisively defeat the Norman forces of George of Antioch at Cape Matapan in 1148. Polani was buried in the San Cipriano monastery in Murano.   "
"Sebastiano Ziani was Doge of Venice from 1172 to 1178. [SEP] He was one of the greatest planners of Venice.During his short term as Doge, Ziani divided the city-state into many districts. He realised that the government headquarters were too close to the shipyard. As such, they were affected by the noise from the shipyard. Ziani resolved this problem by donating a piece of land to the city-state and relocating the shipyard in it. He also hosted Pope Alexander III, the Emperor Frederick I, and the delegation of William II of Sicily for the signing of the Treaty of Venice in July 1177. He was married to a woman named Cecilia.

"Andrea Barozzi (fl. 1245–1278) was a Venetian nobleman. [SEP] He was hereditary lord of Santorini in the Cyclades, and served as official and military commander for the Venetian Republic. Andrea was the firstborn son of Iacopo Barozzi, lord of Santorini and Therasia. He succeeded his father upon his death c. 1245.Unlike most Venetians who had established petty principalities in the Aegean in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, the Barozzi remained loyal to the Republic, and often served in various public offices. In 1252, the Venetian authorities ceded Andrea Barozzi two knightly fiefs in the Venetian colony of Crete. In 1258–59 he held the high office of Bailo of Negroponte. At that time, he negotiated a treaty to end the War of the Euboeote Succession, between the Triarchs of Negroponte, who had been backed by Venice, and William II of Villehardouin, the Prince of Achaea. Barozzi also renewed the 1256 treaty with the Triarchs in terms advantageous to Venice.In 1264, he was placed in command of a fleet of c. 50 ships to prevent the Genoese from raiding the annual trade convoy to the Levant. He was tricked, however, by the Genoese commander, Simone Grillo: Grillo spread rumours that he intended to head due east to the Levant, whereas in reality he took up station at Malta. When Barozzi took the bait and moved east to pursue Grillo with his much larger fleet, the latter was free to attack the Venetian convoy off Saseno, and capture it almost in its entirety; only the giant merchant ship Roccafortis escaped. In the meantime, Barozzi was pressing on eastwards, searching in vain for Grillo's fleet. Arriving before Tyre on 2 September, he encountered a Genoese merchantman carrying 11,000 bezants worth of silk, the Oliva, in the harbour. With the Genoese fleet nowhere in sight, Barozzi resolved to seize the ship, despite the warnings of the city's lord, Philip of Montfort, a Genoese ally, that he would confiscate double the amount in Venetian properties if they did so. Barozzi did not hesitate long: he not only captured the Oliva, but also began a siege of Tyre itself, in the hopes of depriving Genoa of access to this, the second-most important port city of the Levant. The Venetians had to interrupt the siege after a few days, however, when news of the events at Saseno reached them. Instead, Barozzi hurried to Acre to escort the previous year's returning convoy back to Venice.In the mid-1270s, he lost his lordship of Santorini, which was reconquered by the Byzantine Empire under the admiral Licario. Andrea Barozzi is attested for the last time in 1278, and likely died soon after.   "
"Iacopo or Jacopo (I) Barozzi (fl. 1207 – 1245) was a Venetian nobleman and the first lord of Santorini in the Cyclades. [SEP] He also served as Duke of Candia for the Venetian Republic. Iacopo Barozzi was born in Venice, in the parish of San Moisè. After the conquest of Constantinople and the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Barozzi seized the islands of Santorini and Therasia, becoming their lord and inaugurating a line that ruled the islands until the mid-14th century. According to later tradition, this happened in 1207, as part of the larger expedition led by Marco Sanudo which established the Duchy of the Archipelago, but no source actually mentions Barozzi as one of Sanudo's companions. Indeed the older sources do not even mention Barozzi swearing any allegiance for his fiefs to Sanudo as Duke of the Archipelago.From 1244 to 1245, he served in the high gubernatorial office of Duke of Candia, in the Venetian colony of Crete. He is last attested c. 1245, and probably died at about that time.   "
"Iacopo or Jacopo II Barozzi (died 1308) was a Venetian nobleman and the third lord of Santorini in the Cyclades. [SEP] He also occupied several high-ranking colonial positions for the Venetian Republic. Iacopo Barozzi was the firstborn son of Andrea Barozzi, the second lord of Santorini and Therasia. These fiefs had been conquered by the Byzantine Empire in the 1270s, and Iacopo's early career was as a colonial administrator for the Venetian Republic in the Aegean: in the early 1290s he served as rector of Chania in the Venetian colony of Crete, then as Bailo of Negroponte from August 1295 to 1297, and finally as Duke of Candia in Crete from 1301 to 1303.Iacopo tried to use his position to recover his father's domains from the Byzantines. In 1301, the Duke of Naxos, William I Sanudo, who considered himself as the feudal overlord of the island, was preparing an expedition to recover Santorini. Its fate is unclear, but in a treaty concluded between Venice and the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1302, Venetian possession of the island was recognized. Iacopo was restored to his position as dominator insularum Sancte Erini et Thyrasie, but recognized only Venice, not the Duke of Naxos, as his suzerain. As a result, the latter seized Iacopo as he was passing through his domains at the end of his tenure as Duke of Candia. The Great Council of Venice promptly intervened and ordered Iacopo's release. Iacopo retired to Candia, where he died in 1308.   "

"Marco Bembo was a Venetian diplomat and colonial official in the 1260s and 1270s. [SEP] Along with Pietro Zeno, he negotiated the ten-year peace treaty with the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, signed at Constantinople on 4 April 1268. In 1269–1270 he served as one of the castellans of Coron, during which time he dealt with the murder of a Venetian archdeacon by a Byzantine sebastokrator (possibly the half-brother of the Emperor, Constantine), who had been captured on a ship off the Morea. In 1270–1271 he was Bailo of Constantinople, and in 1273–1274 Bailo of Negroponte. In 1275 he was sent on an embassy to Genoa with Giovanni Corner, and in the next year, he was sent to negotiate a new treaty with the Byzantine Emperor, along with Matteo Gradenigo. Gradenigo died during the long negotiations, and the two-year agreement was finally concluded by Bembo alone on 19 March 1277.   "
"Pietro Correr (c. 1235/40 – c. 1302) was an Italian Roman Catholic clergyman of the Correr family of Venice. [SEP]    The son of Angelo Correr, a senator of Venice, Pietro first appears in the historical record in 1265 as pieve to the church of Sant'Aponal. In 1267 he appears as primicerius of St Mark's Basilica and in 1275 as rector of San Maurizio. Another document of 1268 shows him to have been a canon in Verona. On the death of Tomaso Franco the relevant cathedral chapter was called upon to elect his successor as bishop of Castello, but it split between Correr's supporters and the backers of Bartolomeo I Querini, a cathedral canon and papal chaplain. The conflict continued and see remained vacant for a long time. Correr looked like winning it but eventually in 1274 pope Gregory X invalidated the election and unilaterally made Querini bishop. The anti-Correr faction in the chapter had probably fallen back on an old law that members of the chapter of St Mark's could not hold titles in the diocese of Castello - Correr was still primicerius and thus was technically still part of that chapter. In 1274 he acquired some funds from Aldinello of Bassano and the following year he attacked Alidnello's son Pietro. The dispute lasted three years and the town council of Bassano had to intervene. Several other documents also show he was still acting as primicerius at this time. In summer 1286 he was elected Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, an honorary title since the Latin Empire had been dissolved after the Byzantine Empire's reconquest of the city in 1261. The Latin Empire had sent western clergy to replace Orthodox ones, but the former were expelled after the reconquest. Even so, the see technically continued, with a chapter of canons electing a patriarch. Correr's election was confirmed by Pope Honorius IV and he was consecrated by Latino Malabranca Orsini, bishop of Ostia. It is unclear if Correr remained in Venice or went east to run the patriarchate's remaining possessions of Crete and at Negroponte - it may have been the former, since on 10 January 1296 he was given some properties in San Pietro di Castello by Cecilia, wife of Matteo Belegno. Some sources name him Archbishop of Candia but this is an error, possibly arising from Pope Boniface VIII's union of that diocese with the patriarchate in 1302, which occurred after Correr's death.

"Jacopo Dondulo (Italian: Giacomo Dondulo or Dandolo; fl. 1258–1288) was a Venetian sailor, military commander, and politician in the 13th century. [SEP] He played a distinguished role in the naval conflicts of the War of Saint Sabas against the Republic of Venice, leading the Venetian navy to a crushing victory at the Battle of Trapani in 1266. He served also several tenures as a member of the Great Council of Venice, as Bailo of Negroponte in 1277–1279, and as Duke of Candia in 1281–1283, where he faced the start of the Revolt of Alexios Kallergis.    Jacopo Dondulo is the only well-known member of his family, which resided in the parish of the Santi Apostoli, and which died out in the first half of the 14th century. As a result, he is often erroneously called ""Dandolo"".    He was born in Venice, probably in the 1210s or 1220s. In 1257, he participated in the expedition to the Levant under Lorenzo Tiepolo, probably as a galley captain. He served with distinction during that year and the next, culminating in the Venetian victory over the Genoese at the Battle of Acre on 24 June 1258, and the expulsion of the Genoese from Acre.  Back in Venice, he was elected to the Great Council of Venice in 1261, and again in 1264. In 1266, he was elected captain of the fleet sent to oppose the Genoese. After leading his fifteen ships on a raid on Tunis, he vainly awaited the arrival of the Genoese fleet in the waters around the Strait of Messina, and turned back towards Venice. At Ragusa he met with news that the Genoese fleet had sailed at last, and with reinforcements of ten more galleys under Marco Gradenigo. The two fleets met at the Battle of Trapani on 23 June 1266, in which the Genoese took up a defensive position, allowing the Venetians to score a crushing victory: almost the entire Genoese fleet was captured.Dondulo was acclaimed a hero on his return to Venice in July, towing the captured ships, and was duly elected as Captain-General of the Sea. He soon fell out with Doge Reniero Zeno, however: the Doge insisted that the fleet restrict itself to escorting the merchant convoys, whereas Dondulo strongly supported the idea that the fleet should, rather than return to Venice once the convoys were safely under way, remain at sea seeking to attack Genoese shipping. As a result of this disagreement, Dondulo resigned and was replaced by his lieutenant, Marco Zeno.Marco Zeno's cautious leadership left the seas open to the Genoese raiders, who preyed on unescorted Venetian shipping, so that in spring 1267, Dondulo was recalled to command. This time he carried out his chosen strategy, keeping the fleet at sea and attacking the Genoese fleet that was blockading Acre in August. This time, the Genoese tried to escape, so that the Venetians only captured five ships; and when the two fleets met again at Tyre, the Genoese again refused to offer battle and escaped. Returning to Venice, Dondulo was again elected to the Great Council on 1 October, as he was again in 1270.    In 1271, he was sent as one of the commanders of the war against Bologna, distinguishing himself during the siege operations at the head of a contingent of conscripted Venetian citizens from the sestiere of San Marco. Following a heavy Venetian defeat on 1 September, Dondulo and his old lieutenant Marco Gradenigo took over the Venetian forces, with Dondulo commanding the fleet on the Po River and Gradenigo the land army. After repulsing a Bolognese attack with heavy losses, the Venetians were able to withdraw orderly and retreat by embarking on Dondulo's fleet. In 1274, Dondulo was elected ducal councillor, and rook part in the signing of a treaty with Mantua. In 1275, he was among the electors of the new Doge, Jacopo Contarini.     In 1277, he was appointed Bailo of Negroponte, during a delicate period. Venice had just concluded a treaty with the Byzantine Empire, which established peace between the two powers in other areas, but explicitly left both free to engage in hostilities over the fate of the island of Negroponte (Euboea).  In 1276, following their victory over the Lombard barons (the ""triarchs"") of Negroponte at the Battle of Demetrias, the Byzantines began the reconquest of Euboea, spearheaded by the Lombard renegade Licario. By 1278, he had seized almost all of the island except for the capital, the city of Negroponte (Chalkis), which was under Venetian control. During Dondulo's two-year term, the Byzantines did not attack the Venetians, but did so within a few weeks after his departure, in a battle in which Licario defeated the Latins and captured John I de la Roche, the Duke of Athens.    In 1280, he was again elected, for the last time, to the Great Council. At the end of his term, he was elected Duke of Candia, i.e., governor of the major Venetian colony of Crete. He held this post in 1281–1283. In this capacity, Dondulo had to confront the outbreak of the last and greatest of the anti-Venetian and pro-Byzantine rebellions of the native Cretans, the Revolt of Alexios Kallergis, which lasted until 1299. Seeking to avoid the uprising, Dondulo called Kallergis to conciliate him, but the latter refused. Giacomo Dolfin was sent to campaign against Kallergis, but with little success. Instead, the Venetian authorities decided to evacuate the part of the island that they could not control effectively. Dondulo himself took the field against the rebels, but without success.After his return to Venice, his fate is obscure. He is next attested on 19 September 1288 at Treviso, where he was seeking to buy property. This is the last notice of him in the sources, and it is likely that he died shortly after.   "

He is not to be confused with the 17th-century Andrea Ghisi, from the same family, who devised a game called Laberinto (""Labyrinth"").  According to Andrea Dandolo, Andrea and his brother Geremia received together possession over Tinos, Mykonos, Skyros, Skopelos and Skiathos, and after the division of these possessions among themselves, Andrea obtained Tinos and Mykonos. The two brothers were not vassals of Sanudo's Duchy of Naxos, however, but directly under the Latin Empire. In 1243 he was engaged with his brother in a long dispute with the Republic of Venice. During the campaign of 1207, the island of Andros had been assigned to Marino Dandolo but at an unknown date (probably between 1238 and 1239), Geremia had seized it by force. Dandolo appealed to the Venetian government but died soon after. This, however, did not prevent the Great Council of Venice on 11 August 1243 from condemning the Ghisi brothers to confiscation of their property, and ordering the Doge of Venice Jacopo Tiepolo to force the restitution of the island. Andrea and Geremia were also ordered to present themselves before the Doge and submit to the Council's decision by 29 June 1244, on pain of exile from Venice and the auctioning of their possessions for the benefit of the dispossessed Dandolo family. The Ghisi probably continued their occupation of Andros, as it was more beneficial to them than the Republic's conditions. As Geremia died some time after August 1243, it was Andrea alone who was eventually exiled from Venice and his possessions auctioned off. By 1251, however, both sides softened their stance and Andrea resolved to submit to new and more lenient demands. From the terms of the agreement, it is clear that he was no longer in direct possession of Andros, which may have devolved to a vassal of the Duchy of Naxos. After fulfilling his obligations, on 28 March 1253, his exile was lifted by the Great Council, but the reclamation of his auctioned goods was long-drawn out affair; even in 1280, years after his death, some still had not been recovered. The last information about Andrea Ghisi comes from an act signed in 1266. He had died by 19 March 1277, when his son Bartholomew appears as lord of Tinos and Mykonos. Apart from Bartholomew, Andrea had six sons (of which only one Marino, survived him) and one daughter, Anfelise, who married Pietro Querini.

Their sister or half-sister, Agnese Ghisi, married Othon de Cicon, who became the lord of Karystos on Euboea.In ca. 1239 Geremia, aided by his brother Andrea, expelled another Venetian nobleman, Marino Dandolo, from his fief of Andros. Dandolo died soon after, but his widow and sister brought a complaint before the Great Council of Venice, which in August 1243 ordered Geremia to restore Andros to the Dandolo heirs on pain of banishment from Venice and the sequestration of his and Andrea's properties there. Despite this decree, Geremia retained control of Andros until he died some years later. The island then reverted to the Duke of Naxos, Angelo Sanudo, but the affair continued to be a cause of dispute in the courts of Venice between Andrea Ghisi, the Sanudi, and the Querini claimants of the Dandolo inheritance, until the early 1290s, when Duke Marco II Sanudo bought out the claims of Niccolò Querini on Andros.After Geremia's death, his relative Filippo Ghisi (married to Geremia's daughter Isabetta) seized control of Geremia's original fiefs until the Byzantines under Licario reconquered them in 1277 and took Filippo prisoner.

Her royal status and 'ostentation of Regal rank' in the Venetian Court has been suggested to have influenced the promulgation of what was called the  ""Promissione"", which was instigated in 1242 and which stated that the Doge was not the executive Head of the State but only the executor of the orders of the Council, and was no longer to be given homage; nor was the dogaressa or any relatives of her to be given any form of public office or power position, nore where they allowed to have a court or household larger than twenty-five free retainers and twenty-five slaves.Dogaressa Valdrada has been described as dominant and forceful, and is said to have had a great deal of control over her husband and the affairs of Venice. Reportedly, she had:   ""good commonsense, and sound probity of life, and she assumed at once an unquestioned control over the actions of her Consort, strong man though he was. Like her sister, the Dowager Dogaressa Costanza, she was a virago, in the sense of a strong personality; and she followed in her sister's steps, ruling not alone her husband, but bending to her will all with whom she was thrown in contact.""Following Jacopo's resignation in early 1249, she lived with him at his private residence at Sant' Agostino, in San Polo.  He died on 19 July 1249. She is said to have died three years later.   It is stated by Edgcumbe Staley in The Dogaressas of Venice that Valdrada had two young children. The accuracy of this statement is questionable, as at the time of her marriage to the Doge she was already well into her forties, and perhaps beyond the years of child-bearing.    "
"Constance of Sicily (floruit 1220), was a Sicilian Princess and the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Pietro Ziani (r. 1205–1229). She was the daughter of Tancred, King of Sicily, and Sibylla of Acerra. [SEP]  Her father died in 1194, and her brother was deposed later that same year, by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, who also captured Constance, her mother and her two sisters. She married the Doge Pietro Ziani in 1213, after the death of his former dogaressa Maria Baseggio.  The marriage was arranged on the suggestion of the doge as a confirmation and renewal of the Treaty of Venice between Sicily and Venice, which had been forged by the father of Pietro Ziani, doge Sebastiano Ziani, and William II of Sicily, the predecessor of Constance's father.  This was the first time a Doge of Venice had married a Princess since Theodora Anna Doukaina Selvo in the 11th-century. She was described as beautiful and dignified, ""a woman of conspicuous ability and ambition""  and well suited to play the part of a princely consort of the ambitious Doge.  She is described by Palazzi:   ""A Queen by birth, Dogaressa of Venice by marriage, she exhibited all the attributes of her royal station, — she was also Duchess of Calabria, — and her high breeding, no less than her beauty, raised her above all petty jealousies.""She was said to respond to all complaints about herself or her spouse with the words: ""I have nothing to do with you!""  The marriage between Constance and Ziani are described as a happy one. Pietro Ziani had only one child, a son, from his first marriage, who died as a child, but his second marriage produced Marco, Marchesina and Maria. There are three versions of her death.  One version claim that she died during the earthquake of 1220.  A second version that she died suddenly in 1228, and that the Doge took it so badly that he abdicated and died soon after.  The third version claim that she was still alive when Pietro Ziani left his office in 1229 and that they lived a peaceful life for several years in retirement in their palace on Santa Giustina. In 1242, her sister Valdrada of Sicily was to become dogaressa by marriage to her husband's successor.   "
"Tomasina Morosini (c. 1250 in Venice – 1300 in Óbuda), Duchess of Slavonia, was a member of the prominent Venetian Morosini family. [SEP] Her son was Andrew III, the Venetian King of Hungary.    She was the daughter of Michele Sbarra Morosini, Patrician of Venice. Her brother was Albertino Morosini. In 1263 she married Stephen the Posthumous, Prince of Hungary in Venice where he was living in exile. His paternity was disputed by his brothers born from their father's earlier marriage and he was not recognized as  heir presumptive to the Hungarian throne. Tomasina gave birth to a son, Andrew III, King of Hungary (ruled 1290-1301), who was named after his grandfather, Andrew II. She supported her son's claim to the Hungarian throne. After the death of King Ladislaus IV, Prince Andrew succeeded to gain the kingdom and he was crowned King of Hungary in the name of Andrew III in 1290. He summoned his mother to Hungary and appointed her Princess of Slavonia. Allegedly she was poisoned in 1300, shortly before her son's death on 14 January 1301 which was also rumoured to have been caused by poisoning. He was the last king of the House of Árpád.   "
"Jacopo Contarini (1194-1280) was the 47th Doge of Venice, from 6 September 1275 to his abdication on 6 March 1280. [SEP] Although he came from one of the most illustrious Venetian families, Contarini was not considered an influential person and he was probably chosen as a compromise between the two major factions. Being already in his eighties and unable to face the position's challenges - a revolt in Istria and Crete and a war with Ancona - he abdicated as Doge after five years and retired to a monastery, where he died the same year. He was probably buried in the church of Frari. He was married to one Jacobina.   "
"Giovanni Dandolo was the 48th Doge of Venice, elected late in his life on 31 March 1280, died on 2 November 1289. [SEP] During his reign the first Venetian gold ducat was introduced into circulation.    Dandolo came from a prominent Venetian family that provided three other doges to Venice: Enrico Dandolo, Francesco Dandolo and Andrea Dandolo. Two women from the Dandolo family married doges:  Giovanna Dandolo with Pasquale Malipiero and Zilia Dandolo with Lorenzo Priuli. Dandolo is a distant relative of many famous figures in Italian history, such as Fra Angelico, Eugenio Canfari, Benito Mussolini.  But belonging to the branch of the parish of S. Moisè, he was the son of Giberto who had defeated the Genoese in the battle near Settepozzi, and of Maria of Gratone Dandolo of S. Polo. According to all the oldest genealogies his grandfather was called Giacomo: it is therefore to be considered a mistake of the most recent literature the attribution to him of the vicedoge Raniero as an ancestor and then of the Doge Enrico as great-grandfather.Giovanni Dandolo was married to some one named Caterina.    Before his election as doge, Dandolo occupied various public positions including Podestà of Bologna and Padua, and commander of the Venetian naval units. He was also a commercial representative of Ragusa in 1237 when he signed a trade agreement with Stefan Vladislav. The news of his election to doge reached him while he was fighting in a military action against Istria and Trieste, which expanded into an open war in the following year, also involving Venice's perennial enemy, the Patriarchate of Aquileia and the Papal States. More armed clashes followed, and continued for the duration of Dandolo's reign as doge. After Dandolo signed the peace Treaty of Ravenna with Ancona, a new military theater opened through the revolt in Crete led by the Greek noble Alexios Kallergis and backed by the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII, Venice's rival for the domination of the eastern Mediterranean. These conflicts forced the Republic of Venice to negotiate peace agreements with Charles of Anjou and Philip III of France, concluding an alliance with the former in the Treaty of Orvieto. During Dandolo's reign as doge, relations with the Vatican were tense.  Venice had refused to join the Papal States in a punitive action against Sicily, provoking Pope Martin IV to excommunicate Venice, which was later repealed in 1285 by Martin's successor, Pope Honorius IV. In 1287 unrest flared up again in Istria and spread to Friuli. The war widened after the intervention of the German Emperor Rudolf I, who was allied with the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and Venice had to sue for peace.  In 1284, the first Venetian gold ducat, later called the Zecchino, was introduced into circulation. The ducat would be used until the end of the Venetian Republic and was always made with the same weight, 3.56 grams of 24 karat (99.7%) gold.  The coin was valid in all states with which Venice traded. The name ducat comes from the inscription on the coin's back:  Sit tibi Christe datus quem tu regis iste ducatus, which frames a picture of Christ. The front of each coin showed the ruling doges on their knees in front of the city's patron saint, Mark the Evangelist. Dandolo was buried in San Zanipolo. The tomb was not preserved, only a stone slab with an inscription commemorates the doge.   "
"Pietro Gradenigo (1251 – 13 August 1311) was the 49th Doge of Venice, reigning from 1289 to his death. [SEP] When he was elected Doge, he was serving as the podestà of Capodistria in Istria.  Venice suffered a serious blow with the fall of Acre, the last Crusader stronghold in the Holy Land, to the Mamluks of Egypt in 1291.  A war between Venice and Genoa began in 1294, and Venice sustained some serious losses: it lost a naval battle, its possessions in Crete were pillaged and the Byzantine emperor, Andronikos II, arrested many Venetians in Constantinople. In response, the Venetian fleet sacked Galata and threatened the imperial palace of Blachernae, but in 1298 they lost again - this time at Curzola. Eventually, in 1299 the two republics signed a peace treaty. Doge Gradenigo was responsible for the so-called Serrata del Maggior Consiglio, the Locking of the Great Council of Venice. This new law, passed in February 1297, restricted membership of the future Councils only to the descendants of those nobles who were its members between 1293 and 1297. This move created an oligarchic system, disenfranchising a great majority of the citizens and provoking some unrest. In 1308, during Gradenigo's reign as doge, Venice became involved in war with the Papacy over the control of Ferrara and on 27 March 1309 the Republic was excommunicated by Pope Clement V, barring all Christians from trading with Venice. The Doge's policy, seen by many as disastrous, led to a plot to depose him and the Great Council, led by Bajamonte Tiepolo and other members of the aristocratic families. On 15 June 1310, the coup failed and its leaders were severely punished. Tiepolo's plot led to the creation of the Council of Ten, initially as a temporary institution, which later evolved into the permanent body which in reality governed the Republic. On 13 August 1311, Gradenigo died, and, since Venice was under interdict and the religious ceremonies could not be held, he was buried in an unmarked grave on Murano.He was married first to Tomasina Morosini (with whom he had a daughter, Anna, wife of Jacopo I da Carrara) and then to Agnese Zantani.

In his youth a sailor, he commanded a flotilla escorting the emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1177, took also part in the Fourth Crusade and sacking of Constantinople. After his election, Ziani is said to consider the transfer of the capital of the Republic to Constantinople, but eventually the Council decided against it. Instead, he organized the Venetian acquisitions in the territory of the Latin Empire: Crete, Corfu, other islands and the substantial part of Constantinople itself, demanding an oath from the Venetian colony in the city. Ziani established also commercial ties with the post-Byzantine states, signing in 1210 a treaty with the despotate of Epirus under Michael I Komnenos Doukas. According to the Cronaca Altinate, he strove to maintain peace with Padua after an incident at a festival in Treviso so that Venice could concentrate on its new Greek territories. He was forced to fend off a Paduan invasion in the War of the Castle of Love (1215).Ziani abdicated in February 1229. He was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Jacopo Tiepolo, but Ziani refused to meet him and died a year later. He is buried in the church of San Giorgio Maggiore.   "
"Giovanni Maria Angiolello was a Venetian traveller, author of an important historical report on the Aq Qoyunlu and early Safavid Persia. [SEP] Born around 1451 or 1452 in Vicenza, under the rule of Venice since 1404, Angiolello left Venice in 1468, took part in the defense of Negroponte, besieged by the Ottoman emperor Mehmed II. Enslaved by the Turks, he was taken to Constantinople where he first served the heir apparent, Prince Mustafa, and then the Grand Seraglio. He was with the Ottoman armies in Persia, in the Balkan Peninsula and Asia (1472-1481). After about 1483 Angiolello’s career is uncertain. He came back to his home town Vicenza, married and became a functionary. He possibly had two missions (perhaps for the Venetian Republic) or stayed (as an agent or merchant) in Persia around 1482 (after Sultan Mehmed’s death) and then in between 1499 and 1515. He died around 1525. In addition to a report on his first trip, it is almost certainly the author of a Turkish History (Historia Turchesca), valuable source for the history of the sultanates of Mehmed II and Bayezid II.

"Komnen Arianiti (fl. 1392–1407) was an Albanian nobleman of the Arianiti family, who held an area in central Albania around Durrës. [SEP] His son Gjergj became a prominent leader of the Ottoman-Albanian wars.    The Albanian Academy treats him as the same person as Comin Spata (Albanian: Komin Spata), who was mentioned between 1392 and 1407. That name appears in the Venetian archives. Gjergj Arianiti was also mentioned in contemporary documents as Aranit Spata. It is unclear whether the Arianiti adopted the name through intermarriage with the Spata family of central Albania or as a toponymic derived from the region of Shpat, which they held in the Middle Ages. Unclear is also his relation to the Komnenos dynasty; he may have descended from a paternal female ancestor who belonged to that imperial family and lived in the early-to-mid 13th century, or adopted the name as other Arianiti kinsmen had in order to strengthen his claims.His domains are mentioned in contemporary Venetian sources as areas located in the vicinity of Durazzo (Durrës) (in partibus Durrachii).    Arianiti was married to a daughter of Nikollë Zaharia. His three sons were Gjergj, Muzakë (father of Moisi Golemi) and Vladan.

His possession of Santorini and Therasia was confirmed by a treaty between the Republic of Venice and the Byzantine Empire in 1310.In 1316, his possessions were raided by Turkish pirates. Around 1325, Barozzi came into conflict with the Duke of Naxos, Nicholas I Sanudo, over his feudal status: the Dukes of Naxos claimed suzerainty of Santorini as lords of the Cyclades archipelago, but the Barozzi had equally staunchly refused to accept such an obligation. Despite the mediation of Venice, the conflict turned into open war between the two. A renewed Venetian intervention in 1328 eventually brought about an armistice in 1331.Andrea II Barozzi died in 1334.

[SEP] Benjamin first appears in 1297, when, following the death of the Prince of Achaea, Florent of Hainaut, his widow, Princess Isabella of Villehardouin withdrew to the castle of Kalamata. To govern the Principality, Isabella appointed Richard Orsini to rule in her stead as bailli and named Benjamin, who had been the protovestiarios of the Principality—an office equivalent to a Western chamberlain and charged with keeping the list of fief-holders—as the new chancellor. Benjamin was succeeded as protovestiarios  by a Greek named Vasilopoulos. In 1300, Richard Orsini was replaced as bailli by Nicholas III of Saint Omer, on Benjamin's advice. Hereditary marshal of the Principality and one of its most powerful barons, Nicholas was also Benjamin's close friend. This began a period of rivalry between Richard and Benjamin.In 1301, Princess Isabella married her third husband, Philip of Savoy. The new Prince quickly made himself unpopular in Achaea by his arrogance, despotic manners, and disregard for the principality's feudal customs. Immediately after his arrival, acting on the advice of a partisan of Richard Orsini, Philip arrested Benjamin on charge of treason and imprisoned him at Andravida. Nicholas of Saint Omer immediately confronted the new prince at Glarentza and vehemently protested this act; violence was averted through the intervention of Isabella and Philip's counsellors. Benjamin was released after a payment of 20,000 hyperpyra, and received in exchange possession of a fief at Perachora near Corinth. Despite this inauspicious start, Benjamin nevertheless quickly managed to win Philip's trust and esteem; on his advice, the Prince now forced Richard Orsini to purchase a fief for the same sum of 20,000 hyperpyra, which, given his own death and the death of his sole heir soon after, reverted to the Achaean fisc.In 1304 he was one of the witnesses at the marriage of Richard Orsini's son and heir, John I Orsini, and Maria Komnene Doukaina. In December 1320, Benjamin became a citizen of the Republic of Venice, and in June of the next year, was among the Achaean magnates who sent a letter to the Doge of Venice offering to hand over the Principality to him.

Radič revolted against the Balšići who ruled the Lordship of Zeta. Radič frequently jeopardized the city of Kotor, maintaining bad relations with them. Radič also had maintained close relations with the Republic of Ragusa, and was granted Venetian citizenship on 30 November 1392.   The Zetan lord, Đurađ II, had problems that arose due to Zetan battles involving the Ottomans which Radič used to become independent of the Zetan lord. In late 1392, Đurađ II kidnapped the sanjak-bey of Skopje. Radič, with the help of his brothers Stefan and Dobrivoje, used this event to take control of Budva, as well as Saint Michael's Metohija, in 1392 from the Balšići, thus becoming the Master of Budva. Radič ruled Budva till his death in 1396. Radič also led an expedition in Lezhë, seizing it from the Dukagjini's, expelling them in the process. However, Radič's reign was very temporary as the Dukagjinis retook Lezhë in early 1393.    In late April 1396, Radič and his brother Dobrivoje had made a significant move against Lord Đurađ II (Balšić) of Zeta. They took the region of Grbalj and laid siege to Kotor. Unable to take the town, the council of Kotor agreed to pay him tribute. Đurađ became disliked by the Orthodox Christian commonfolk by these events. The Orthodox Crnojevići's takeover was welcomed by the people, resulting in Paštrović's crossing over to Radič's side. On 25 April or May 1396, the duo moved to battle Đurađ himself. This was a grave mistake as Đurađ's forces completely defeated the Crnojevići and killed Radič, managing to get a hold over a part of the Crnojević domain.

"Lorenzo de Monacis was a distinguished diplomat of the Venetian Republic. [SEP] He was also an influential historian who wrote the history of Venice, a work which formed the basis of Marcantonio Sabellico's writings on the history of Venice.De Monacis combined early humanist ideas and his own experience as a diplomat during a time of expansion of the Venetian imperium and developed literary works which sought to give an ideological basis to Venetian expansionism. His works provided Venice with an ideological support base which justified the initial stages of the Venetian incursions into Italy and Dalmatia.    In 1386 Lorenzo de Monacis accompanied Venetian diplomat Pantaleone Barbo to Hungary representing Venice's interests during a crisis involving the succession to the Hungarian throne. The diplomatic mission was successful as described in a report by de Monacis to the Venetian government. During the mission, de Monacis wrote a poem defending Hungarian queens Mary and Elizabeth who were accused of the murder of Charles II of Hungary.In 1389, de Monacis accompanied Barbo again on another diplomatic mission to Hungary when they fell victims to robbery. The two diplomats, having lost all their personal belongings during the incident, received 60 gold ducats as compensation awarded to them by the Maggior Consiglio of Venice. De Monacis returned to Hungary on another mission in 1390.In November 1388 de Monacis was elected Grand Chancellor of Crete, one of the most prestigious offices in the Venetian realm.

"Francesco Foscari (19 June 1373 – 1 November 1457) was the 65th Doge of the Republic of Venice from 1423 to 1457. [SEP] His reign, the longest of all Doges in Venetian history, lasted 34 years, 6 months and 8 days, and coincided with the inception of the Italian Renaissance.     Francesco Foscari was born in 1373, as the oldest son of Nicolò Foscari and his wife Cateruzia Michiel. The Foscari family had been of only moderate importance, but had managed to become one of the few noble families that secured a hereditary place in the Great Council of Venice after the so-called Serrata (""Closing"") of the Great Council, and had begun to rise in prominence throughout the 14th century. Francesco's ancestors began holding high public office, and his father Nicolò even became a member of the powerful Council of Ten.Francesco served the Republic of Venice in numerous official capacities—as ambassador, president of the Council of Forty, member of the Council of Ten, inquisitor, Procurator of St Mark's, avogador de comùn— before he was elected in 1423 defeating the other candidate, Pietro Loredan. His task as doge was to lead Venice in a long and protracted series of wars against Milan, governed by the Visconti, who were attempting to dominate all of northern Italy. Despite the justification of Venetian embroilment in the terraferma that was offered in Foscari's funeral oration, delivered by the humanist senator and historian Bernardo Giustiniani, and some victories, the war was extremely costly to Venice, whose real source of wealth and power was at sea.  Venice, which during Foscari's leadership abandoned her ally Florence, was eventually overcome by the forces of Milan under the leadership of Francesco Sforza. Sforza soon made peace with Florence, however, leaving Venice alone.  Foscari was married twice: first to Maria Priuli, and then in 1415 to Marina Nani. In 1445, his only surviving son, Jacopo, was tried by the Council of Ten on charges of bribery and corruption and exiled from the city. Two further trials, in 1450 and 1456 - during the latter he confessed to, without even the need of torture, of having pleaded for help the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II and the aforementioned Duke of Milan, both Venice's enemies - led to Jacopo's imprisonment on Crete and his eventual death there soon after.News of Jacopo's death caused Foscari to withdraw from his government duties, and in October 1457 the Council of Ten forced him to abdicate. However, his death a week later provoked such public outcry that he was given a state funeral.  Beside his profile portrait by Lazzaro Bastiani, Foscari commissioned a bas-relief bronze plaquette from Donatello, which survives in several examples. His figure kneeling in prayer to St Mark figured over the portal to the Doge's Palace until it was dismantled by order of the revolutionary government, 1797; the head was preserved and is conserved in the Museo dell'Opera di Palazzo Ducale. His monument by the sculptor Antonio Bregno in collaboration with his architect brother Paolo was erected in the church of Santa Maria dei Frari in Venice.    Foscari's life was the subject of a play The Two Foscari by Lord Byron (1821) and an episode in Samuel Rogers' long poem Italy. The Byron play served as the basis for the libretto written by Francesco Maria Piave for Giuseppe Verdi's opera I due Foscari, which premiered on 3 November 1844 in Rome. Mary Mitford, author of the popular literary sketches of the English countryside entitled Our Village, also wrote a successful play concerned with events in Foscari's life.

When he went to Italy is not certain; according to some accounts he was summoned to Venice about 1430 to act as amanuensis to Francesco Barbaro, who appears to have already made his acquaintance; according to others he did not visit Italy till the time of the Council of Florence (1438–1439). He learned Latin from Vittorino da Feltre, and made such rapid progress that in three years he was able to teach Latin literature and rhetoric. His reputation as a teacher and a translator of Aristotle was very great, and he was selected as secretary by Pope Nicholas V, an ardent Aristotelian. The bitterness of his attacks upon Plato (in the Comparatio Aristotelis et Platonis of 1458, described by historian James Hankins as ""one of the most remarkable mixtures of learning and lunacy ever penned""), which drew forth a powerful response from Bessarion (In calumniatorem Platonis, printed in 1469) and the manifestly hurried and inaccurate character of his translations of Plato, Aristotle and other classical authors, combined to ruin his fame as a scholar, and to endanger his position as a teacher of philosophy. (Pope Pius II was among the critics of George's translations.) The indignation against George on account of his first-named work was so great that he would probably have been compelled to leave Italy had not Alfonso V of Aragon given him protection at the court of Naples. He subsequently returned to Rome, where in 1471 he published a very successful Latin grammar based on the work of another Greek grammarian of Latin, Priscian. Additionally, an earlier work on Greek rhetorical principles garnered him wide recognition, even from his former critics who admitted his brilliance and scholarship.

In 1402, as an Ottoman vassal, together with other Albanian noblemen, he fought alongside Bayezid I's forces in the Battle of Ankara. After the Ottoman defeat, he accepted the suzerainty of the Venetian Republic as a vassal of Koja Zaharia. He is last mentioned in the sources in 1409 and is supposed to have died the same year. After his death, Gjon Kastrioti took possession of the Jonima dominions, which became a part of the Principality of Kastrioti. Other members of the Jonima family are mentioned in Shkodër region later, however they never reached the fame of Dhimitër Jonima. Even long after his death, in 1431, upon the defeat of Gjon Kastrioti by Ottoman forces, the lands taken from him and once belonging to Jonima family, were registered by Ottomans as the vilayet of Dhimitër Jonima.    His name has been spelled ""Demetrius Jonima"", ""Dimitri Jonima"", ""Dmitar Gonoma"", and in Albanian: Dhimitër Jonima.   "
"John Komnenos Asen (Bulgarian:   , romanized: Yoan Komnin Asen; Greek:   , romanized: Iōannēs Komnēnos Asanēs; Serbian:   , romanized: Jovan Komnin Asen) was the ruler of the Principality of Valona from circa 1345 to 1363, initially as a vassal of the Serbian Empire, and after 1355 as a largely independent lord. [SEP] Descended from high-ranking Bulgarian nobility, John was a brother of both Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria and Helena of Bulgaria, the wife of Tsar Stephen Dušan of Serbia. Perhaps in search of better opportunities, he emigrated to Serbia, where his sister was married. There, he was granted the title of despot by Stephen Dušan, who placed him in charge of his territories in modern south Albania. As the despot of Valona, John established commercial ties with Venice and Ragusa, and he became a citizen of the former in 1353. After the death of Dušan in 1355, he took the side of the unsuccessful Simeon Uroš in the ensuing conflict for the Serbian throne. With Venetian assistance, John maintained the essentially independent status of the Principality of Valona. He probably died of the plague in 1363 and he was succeeded by Alexander Komnenos Asen, who was likely his son from his unknown first wife. John's second marriage was to the former Epirote queen-consort Anna Palaiologina.     While the birth date of John Komnenos Asen is unknown, his origin is clearly documented in the sources. On both sides, he descended from the highest ranks of 14th-century Bulgarian nobility. He was born to Keratsa Petritsa, a daughter of despot Shishman of Vidin, and Sratsimir, the despot of Kran. John's mother was a descendant of the Asen dynasty as a grand granddaughter of Tsar Ivan Asen II. His siblings were Ivan Alexander, who would ascend to the Bulgarian throne in 1331, and Helena, who married Serbian ruler Stephen Dušan in 1332. Even though John was commonly referred to as a Komnenos in the sources, his relations to that Byzantine family are rather scarce. He had rights to that name either through his mother's descent from the Asens, themselves related to the Komnenoi, or through his marriage to Anna Palaiologina.It is uncertain as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest. Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov is of the opinion that John was not seeking political refuge in Serbia. Instead, it is most likely that he moved to that country with the belief that Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities. Presumably, John accompanied his sister Helena when she moved to Serbia to marry Stephen Dušan in 1332.John was first mentioned as the despot of Valona in 1350 and his documented presence in the Albanian lands only dates to 1349. However, he was most likely bestowed the title as early as 1345 or 1346, when Stephen Dušan was proclaimed Emperor (Tsar). American scholar John Fine believes this happened immediately after Stephen Dušan's coronation in 1346. Along with Stephen Dušan's half-brother, Simeon Uroš, and Jovan Oliver, John was one of three people to bear that title under Stephen Dušan.John was installed as ruler of Valona in late 1345, in the wake of the Serbian conquest of south Albania from the Byzantine Empire, which was concluded no later than August 1345. Besides the Adriatic port of Valona (modern Vlorë), John's appanage included nearby Kanina and the inland castle of Berat to the northeast. Other than that, the extent of his domain is uncertain. Estimates of the area John ruled over range from all of central Albania to only the three cities mentioned, with the rest remaining under the government of local Albanian nobility, who owed allegiance either to John or to Stephen Dušan directly. To the south, John's appanage bordered on the lands of Simeon Uroš, the ruler of Epirus.    In 1349, John plundered a Venetian commercial ship which had been shipwrecked on the coast he controlled, in accordance with the medieval principle of jus naufragii. This act necessitated the involvement of Stephen Dušan in order to settle the dispute between Venice and John, as evidenced by an official document from 13 April 1350. Despite this conflict, under John the Principality of Valona was an active partner of Venice and Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) in maritime commerce. Two receipts from 27 April 1350 document John's role as a mediator in cattle, sugar and pepper trade and reveal that he received significant income from the Valona customs. The customs was profitable because the port was often visited by merchant ships. Even though all of these documents were written in Slavic, John signed his name in Greek, which testifies to his Hellenisation. At the time, John also had ties with the Mamluk rulers of Egypt, who addressed him as “King of Serbia and Bulgaria” in correspondence.In 1353, John and his family were granted Venetian citizenship, which hints that his domain was under the protection of Venice. The premature death of Stephen Dušan in 1355 plunged the Serbian Empire into civil war. In that conflict, John took the side of his wife's son-in-law Simeon Uroš against the legitimate successor Stephen Uroš, who was Stephen Dušan's son and Simeon Uroš's nephew. While Simeon's attempt at taking the throne was ill-fated and Stephen Uroš even captured Berat in 1356, John managed to preserve his remaining lands and became independent from both Simeon and Stephen Uroš. The threat of Nikephoros II Orsini, who was gaining ground in Thessaly and Epirus, forced John to request the dispatch of a Venetian warship and an administrator from Venice to take control of his domain, to which the republic obliged.Bulgarian historian Hristo Matanov conjectures that after 1355, John may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside the inner Balkans. He bases this theory on a new reading of several Latin-language coin inscriptions as Monita despoti Ioanni instead of Monita despoti Oliveri, as previously thought. The new reading, which would identify the coins as being minted by John, was proposed by Yugoslav numismatist Nedeljković, who rejects the initial attribution of these coins to Jovan Oliver.A commercial document from 30 January 1359, which testifies to John's continuing trade relations with Venice, is chronologically the last reference to his activity in contemporary sources. While the date of his death was not recorded, it is likely that John perished during the plague epidemic which hit Valona and Durazzo (today Durrës) in 1363.    John's first marriage probably dates to after his arrival in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. If the next ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, then he would have been born circa 1346–1348, as he was already an adult in 1363–1366. This would place John's potential first marriage a few years before Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350–1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain Komnena, the wife of Balša II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.   "
"Marina Galina (died 1420), was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Michele Steno (r. 1400-1413).  She was a member of the ancient family of Galina and its status far exceeded that of the family of her future spouse. [SEP] The year of her marriage is not confirmed but reported to have been 1362.  She had no children.  While the year of her birth is not known, she was reportedly quite elderly when she became dogaressa.  Her spouse was elected doge in 1400.  She was crowned and had her solemn Entry into the City in to the city in 1401.  She was the dogaressa during a golden age for Venice, and acted as the protector of literature, culture and crafts work.  Marina Galina and Michele Steno where both old when they became dogaressa and doge, but both was described as youthful people who enjoyed the latest fashion and parties, and their tenure hosted a spectacular court life at the Doge Palace.  She as well as her spouse were members of the famous cultural society Compagnia della Calza.  The Compagnia was a club composed of aristocratic males and female associates interested in fashion, and its purpose was to organize State pageants, receptions of foreign princes and ambassadors, performances of games and plays, and the attendance at solemn Ecclesiastical functions.She was widowed in 1413. She is known to have made at least five different wills during her lifetime.   "
"Pietro Cornaro, also known as Peter Cornaro (died in 1387 or 1388), was Lord of Argos and Nauplia in Frankish Greece from 1377. [SEP]    Pietro was the son of Federigo Cornaro (it.) di Santa Lucia. He was born before 1363. Being one of the wealthiest Venetian patricians of his age, Federigo could afford to conduct his own foreign policy. Historian Anthony Luttrell proposes that Federigo arranged Pietro's marriage with Maria of Enghien, Lady of Argos and Nauplia, in 1377 most probably because he wanted to establish a commercial basis in the Peloponnese. The Senate of Venice authorized him on 16 July 1377 to arm a galley and to transport Maria to Venice.    Pietro's marriage with Maria made him her co-ruler in 1377, but he was still young. His father took care of the defense of Argos and Nauplia and sent supplies to the two towns in 1378. Federigo also bought a galley to defend the lordship against pirates in 1381. Heavy taxation during the War of Chioggia and a financial crisis menaced the family's position, but Pietro could keep his lordship after his father died in 1382. Pietro went to Argos to command the defense of Argos and Nauplia against the pirates in 1383. He returned to Venice, but he was planning to again visit his lordship in early 1385. Pietro was one of the lords in Frankish Greece whom King Peter IV of Aragon informed about his appointment of Bernard of Cornella as his vicar-general in the Duchy of Athens on 17 August 1387. Pietro died in 1387 or 1388. His widow sold the lordship to Venice on 12 December 1388.   "
"Pietro Zeno (died 17 January 1345) was the Venetian captain and bailiff of Negroponte (1331–33) and one of the leaders of the Smyrniote crusade (1343–45).In May–June 1332, an Aydinid Turkish fleet of 380 ships under Umur Bey attacked Negroponte. [SEP] Zeno bought them off with a large tribute. On 18 July 1332, Doge Francesco Dandolo charged Zeno and Pietro da Canale with arranging an anti-Turkish alliance. By the end of the year the Naval League, ""a union, society and league for the discomfiture of the Turks and the defence of the true faith"", had been formally constituted. In 1334 Zeno took command of the league's fleet of twenty galleys and on 14 September defeated the large fleet of Yakhshi, emir of Karasi, off Adramyttion.In September 1343, the Venetian Grand Council elected Zeno captain of the flotilla of five galleys which it was sending to assist the crusade against Aydinid-held Smyrna. Although the crusade was a great naval success and Smyrna was taken, Zeno was killed by Umur Bey's forces in an ambush while he and the other crusader leaders, including Henry of Asti, were attempting to celebrate a mass in a church in the no-man's-land between the battle lines.Zeno's son, also Pietro Zeno, was a famous diplomat in the eastern Mediterranean.

"Niccolò Pisani (fl.1350-1354) was a Venetian admiral renowned for his victories during the 14th Century war between the Republic of Venice and its rival Italian republic, Genoa.In [SEP] 1350, when a centuries-long feud between Venice and Genoa erupted again into open war, the Venetian doge, Andrea Dandolo, gave the experienced Pisani command of the city's main fleet. Pisani was dispatched in 1352 to engage the Genoan navy, commanded by his counterpart and rival Paganino Doria, near Constantinople.  There, Pisani won a victory in a brutal battle against the Genoans at the Bosphorus.  However, this victory proved indecisive, as Venetian losses were so great they were unable to continue the assault.  Pisani later inflicted another devastating blow by wiping out a Genoese fleet off Sardinia.Pisani's distinguished career came to an end when Doria won a crushing victory over him at Porto Longo in 1354.  While Pisani survived and escaped, the defeat would haunt him for the rest of his life.  Only five of the approximately 40 galleys under his command escaped the battle, and Venice itself was only spared by a peace imposed on the two republics by the Duke of Milan.  While the usual punishment for a Venetian admiral responsible for such a disaster would be death, Pisani's previous victories and popularity with the common people of the city earned him some clemency.  However, Pisani was banned from holding future office and sentenced to six months in prison for his role in the catastrophe.Niccolò's son, Vettor Pisani, was with him at Porto Longo, and would go on to command the Venetian navy more than two decades later in another war with the Genoese.  After several reversals during the campaign, Vettor would play a key role in the ultimate Venetian victory at Chioggia.   "
"Pietro Zeno (d. 1427), was sovereign lord of Andros and Syros from 1384 until his death in 1427, and a distinguished diplomat in the service of the Republic of Venice. [SEP]    Pietro Zeno was the son of the Venetian bailo at Negroponte, also named Pietro Zeno. In early 1384 he married Petronilla Crispo, daughter of Francesco I Crispo, tenth Duke of the Archipelago, as part of the latter's attempt to secure Venetian recognition of his usurpation of the ducal throne after murdering his predecessor, Nicholas III dalle Carceri. As his wife's dowry, Pietro received the islands of Andros and Syros.Zeno was a very able diplomat; the historian of Frankish Greece William Miller calls him ""a diplomatist of unrivalled experience in the tortuous politics of the Levant"" and ""the most useful diplomatist of the age"". As a result, the Venetians employed him in several difficult and delicate negotiations. He played a role in the negotiations that saw the return of Argos to the Republic of Venice after its occupation by the Byzantine Despot of the Morea, Theodore I Palaiologos. In the aftermath of the Battle of Ankara in 1402 he was sent to the Ottoman court to seek Ottoman support against the Florentine adventurer Antonio I Acciaioli, who had recently captured Athens from Venice. Playing on Ottoman fears of a concerted Christian campaign against them in the aftermath of their disastrous defeat at Ankara, he managed to extract a number of concessions from Süleyman Çelebi in the Treaty of Gallipoli, concluded in January or early February 1403: Venice was granted a strip of territory on the Greek mainland opposite the whole length of the island of Euboea, which was a Venetian possession; the Northern Sporades were ceded to the Byzantines; the transfer of the County of Salona to the Knights Hospitaller was ratified; the tribute levied on the Marquisate of Bodonitsa was not raised; and finally the Sultan promised to restore Athens to Venice. In the event, the latter promise remained a dead letter, and Venice was forced to recognize Acciaioli rule over Athens a few years later. In 1404, Zeno visited England to seek the aid of Henry IV of England, but without any tangible success.Despite his great diplomatic ability and prestige, which led to him being attributed the title of ""Duke of Andros"", even Zeno found it difficult to manoeuvre among the various competing powers of the era. Syros, Paros and other islands were left destitute and almost depopulated by the repeated Ottoman raids. Andros managed to escape relatively unscathed, but in return Zeno was forced to pay tribute and provide harbour and shelter for the Turkish ships there. Nevertheless, in 1416, the island was raided and almost the entire population carried off by the Ottomans. At about the same time Albanians crossed from Euboea over into the island, settling in its northern part. In 1427, Pietro Zeno died, and was succeeded by his son Andrea, who was of poor health and only had a daughter. In 1437, Andrea too died, and the island was taken over by Venice, which installed a governor there until 1440, when its ownership was given to Crusino I Sommaripa.   "

"Marco Cornaro (c. 1286 – 13 January 1368), also known as Marco Corner, was the 59th doge of Venice, ruling between 1365 and 1368. [SEP] His brief reign saw the loss of Venetian territory to Genoa and the Ottoman Empire, though Venice was to enjoy economic growth during this time.     The Cornaro family to which the future doge was born was one of Venice's oldest, its lineage traceable to the Romans. It was also one of the richest, having achieved this status from money-lending. The Cornaros would produce three more doges in the 17th and 18th centuries. Marco Cornaro's first marriage was to Giovanna Scrovegni of Padua, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. His second marriage was to a woman named Caterina about whom little is known other than her low social status made his later election to the doge difficult. Dogaressa Caterina was somewhat mocked for her simple habits, which was not seen as suitable for the rank of a dogaressa, but he always defended her and called her a good woman and wife. Cornaro acquired his own wealth through trade with Egypt. He also followed both military and political careers in the service of the Republic, leading troops at sea and on the mainland. He served as ambassador to Emperor Charles IV and Pope Clement VI, and was also a member of the Venetian delegation to the election of Pope Urban V in Avignon. Cornaro was instrumental in the discovery and suppression of the attempted coup d'état in 1355 by the then doge Marino Faliero, who intended to declare himself prince of Venice. Following the dissolution of the plot and execution of the conspirators, Cornaro was briefly made vice-doge before a successor to Faliero could be appointed.    On the death of the previous incumbent Lorenzo Celsi on 18 July 1365, Cornaro was elected to the dogal office, despite the aspersions cast by his opponents over his advanced age, his wife's low birth and his friendships with foreign princes. Once elected, in contrast to his predecessors, he established a respectful stance towards Venice's public bodies. During the two and a half years of his reign, Venice saw no major changes or wars, although it lost the islands of Chios and Lesbos and the city of Phocaea to the Republic of Genoa. He was successful in re-establishing Venetian trade with Egypt by convincing Urban V to rescind his prohibition on dealing with infidels. Cornaro ordered the construction of a wing of the Doge's Palace on its side facing San Marco. Marco Cornaro died in the early hours of 13 January 1368. He is buried in the Basilica of San Zanipolo.

"Andrea Dandolo (1306 – 7 September 1354) was elected the 54th doge of Venice in 1343, replacing Bartolomeo Gradenigo who died in late 1342. [SEP]    Trained in historiography and law, Andrea Dandolo studied at the University of Padua, where he became a law professor until he was elected as doge.  He was descended from an old Venetian noble family, the Dandolo, that played an important role in Venetian politics from the 12th to 15th centuries, and produced four Venetian doges, of whom he was the last, numerous admirals and several other prominent citizens. His great-great-great grandfather was Pietro Dandolo.Dandolo's rise to prominence in Venetian public life was precocious.  In 1331, at the age of only 25, he was named procurator of St. Mark's Basilica.    He became doge in 1343 at the age of 37.Dandolo was known as a benefactor of the arts.  To St Mark's Basilica he added the Chapel of San Isidoro, oversaw changes to the Pala d'Oro and expanded and beautified the Baptistery. He reformed the Venetian legal code, formally proclaiming a legal framework in 1346 that compiled all of the applicable laws in the Republic.  He was a friend of Petrarch's, who wrote of Dandolo that he was ""a just man, incorruptible, full of ardor and love for his country, erudite, eloquent, wise, affable and humane"".His reign was beset by challenges as Venice was struck by a violent earthquake on 25 January 1348 that caused hundreds of casualties, destroyed numerous buildings and, it was assumed at the time, provoked the terrible outbreak of the Black Death,  which did not end until 1350.  Between 1348 and 1350 a third of the population died. Also Venice endured a disastrous war with the Hungarians following Zadar's seventh revolt against the Most Serene Republic in 1345.  Allied with the Hungarians, Genoa deployed a powerful naval fleet to the Adriatic under the command of Paganino Doria that devastated the Venetian territories and threatened Venice herself.  Venice was saved by the great naval victory of Lojera in 1353. Dandolo was the last doge to be interred in St Mark's Basilica.    Dandolo wrote two chronicles in Latin on the history of Venice, the Chronica per extensum descripta aa. [ad annum] 46–1280 d.C. [dopo Cristo], written between 1344 and 1351/52, and the Chronica brevis aa. 46–1342 d.C., written before 1342, which can both be found in volume XII of Muratori’s collection Rerum Italicarum Scriptores.

"Francesco Dandolo (died 1339) was the 52nd Doge of Venice. [SEP]  He ruled from  1329 to 1339.  During his reign Venice began its policy of extending its territory on the Italian mainland.    The Dandolo family played an important role in Venetian history from the 12th to the 15th century. Historical references to the family go as far back as the 11th century; however, the family is not considered to be one of the so-called old families (case vecchie) of Venice, as it does not appear on the list of the founding families of Venice. Besides Francesco Dandolo, three other members of the family became doge: Giovanni Dandolo, Andrea Dandolo and Enrico Dandolo. Two women from the family married doges: Giovanna Dandolo to Pasqual Malipiero and Zilia Dandolo to Lorenzo Priuli. Dandolo himself was married to Elisabetta Contarini.    Dandolo was one of the most successful Venetian diplomats.  He was the Venetian Ambassador to the popes Pope Clement V and Pope John XXII in Avignon, which at that time hosted the papal residence.  Dandolo was nicknamed cane (dog) after an incident in which he presented himself to the pope wearing a chain around his neck in an attempt to get the pope to revoke the excommunication of Venice.  Dandolo was married to Eisabetta Contarini and had three children.     During his reign Venice had many skirmishes with the Turks who would rival Venice for domination of the eastern Mediterranean over the next several centuries. Venice also engaged in violent confrontations with the Lord of Verona Mastino II della Scala who continued the territorial politics of his uncle Cangrande I della Scala with the same aggressiveness.  The Venetian-occupied cities of Feltre, Belluno und Vicenza were threatened by the Veronese but Venice did not react until the Veronese began to control the flow of river trade and tried to set up a trading base in Chioggia.  An alliance was formed between the cities of Venice, Florence, Perugia, Siena, and Bologna in order to counter the threat from Verona. In contrast to the usual practice of that time, Venice did not hire an army of mercenaries but instead conscripted its citizens between the ages of 20 and 60 for military service.  With this method Venice was able to field an army of 40,000.  The battles took place on the entire territory of the Scaliger, with varying results for both sides.  Eventually, however, Mastino was defeated. In March, 1337 both sides came to a peace agreement after lengthy negotiations that allowed the soldiers to return to their cities and recover their land. Venice received guarantees of free trade for the affected areas. Mastino, unhappy with the terms of the peace agreement, called upon Emperor Louis IV for help as a mediator, but the emperor sided with the doge and awarded Venice the rights to the city of Mestre.  On January 24, 1339 the peace agreement was sealed in Saint Mark's Basilica in Venice.  Treviso now came under the control of Venice, Florence received some castles but not the city of Lucca, which caused resentment in Florence and became one of the causes for the subsequent tensions between Venice and Florence. Dandolo died on All Saints' Day in 1339.  He was interred in the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.   "
"Marino Faliero (1274 – 17 April 1355) was the 55th Doge of Venice, appointed on 11 September 1354. [SEP] He was sometimes referred to simply as Marin Falier (Venetian rather than standard Italian) or Falieri. He was executed for attempting a coup d'etat.     Faliero was the son of Iacopo Marin and Beriola Loredan.  He had an uncle of the same name with whom he is often confused. In 1315 Faliero was one of the three heads of the Council of Ten when it was punishing the organizers of the 1310 conspiracy by Bajamonte Tiepolo. Faliero continued as a member of the council until 1320 and held the office of chief and inquisitor several times.  In 1320 he was charged with Andrea Michiel to organize the killing of Tiepolo and Pietro Querini, the only two leaders of the conspiracy still at large. In 1323 Faliero was appointed captain and bailiff of Negroponte. In 1326 he was again in Venice as a member of the Council of Ten, but the following year he left for Bologna on a mission to the prior of the Servites who had a dispute with Venice. Back again in the Ten, he left shortly after to be elected one of the Five Elders to Peace, another group of Venetian magistrates. After a few years of absence from public life, he reappears again in 1330 as a member of the Council of Ten. In 1333 he became captain of the galleys of the Major Sea and of Constantinople and protected the merchants going to Tanais in the Black Sea.     Faliero was a naval and military commander and then a diplomat before being elected doge in succession to Andrea Dandolo. He learned of his election while he was on a diplomatic mission to the papal court at Avignon. The populace of Venice was at that time disenchanted with the ruling aristocrats who were blamed for a recent naval defeat by the fleet of the Republic of Genoa at the 1354 Battle of Portolungo during the Third Venetian–Genoese War.Within months of being elected, Faliero attempted a coup d'etat in April 1355, aiming to take effective power from the ruling aristocrats. According to tradition, this came about because the dogaressa, Faliero's second wife, Aluycia Gradenigo, had been insulted by Michele Steno, a member of an aristocratic family, but in a study of doges of Venice Antonella Grignola suggests that Faliero's move was consistent with a prevailing trend in Italian cities to move away from oligarchic government to absolute, dynastic rule.The plot was badly organised, with poor communication between the conspirators, and was quickly discovered. Faliero pleaded guilty to all charges and was beheaded on 17 April and his body mutilated. Ten additional ringleaders were hanged on display from the Doge's Palace in Piazza San Marco.     Faliero was condemned to damnatio memoriae, and accordingly his portrait displayed in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Doge's Palace was removed and the space painted over with a black shroud, which can still be seen in the hall today. A Latin language inscription on the painted shroud reads: Hic est locus Marini Faletro decapitati pro criminibus (""This is the space reserved for Marino Faliero, beheaded for his crimes"").The story of Faliero's failed plot was later made into plays by Lord Byron (in 1820) and Casimir Delavigne (in 1829). The latter's version was adapted into an eponymous opera scored by Gaetano Donizetti in 1835. All three present the traditional story that Faliero was acting to defend his wife's honour. Prussian author E. T. A. Hoffmann used a different approach in his 1818 novella Doge and Dogess; German composer Robert Schumann contemplated writing an opera based on Hoffmann's story.His home, Palazzo Falier, still exists in Venice, being one of the oldest structures there.

"Marino Zorzi (c. 1231 – 3 July 1312), born in Venice, was the 50th Doge of the Republic of Venice, from 23 August 1311 to his death. [SEP] He was married to Agneta Querini.  Considered to have been a devout man, he had served as an ambassador to Rome. He may have been elected to decrease tensions in the city caused by the attempted revolt of Bajamonte Tiepolo as well as tensions with Rome, still angry with Venice over her occupation of the city of Ferrara (1308–09). Zorzi had not been the first choice as Doge; Stefano Giustinian had been chosen first, but Giustinian had refused the honor.  The elderly Zorzi did not succeed in re-establishing good relations with the Papacy and his short reign was characterized by several natural calamities.  His reign lasted only eleven months, and Zorzi, considered a saint in his lifetime, died in 1312.  His garments were sought after as holy relics. His dogaressa, Agnese, is known to have intervened to have the silk-masters of Lucca train apprentices and supervise the production of silk fabris in the workshops of the Venetian fraglia.   "
"Ivan Strez Balšić (fl. 1444–1469) and his brothers George Strez and Gojko Balšić were the lords of Misia, a coastal area from the White Drin towards the Adriatic. [SEP] The brothers were members of the Balšić family, which earlier held Zeta, but had now placed itself among the nobility in Albania. They participated in founding of the League of Lezhë, an alliance led by their maternal uncle Skanderbeg. Ivan and Gojko supported Skanderbeg until he died in 1468 and then continued to fight against Ottomans together with Venetian forces. After Skanderbeg's death Venice installed Ivan Strez Balšić as Skanderbeg's successor.    According to Gjon Muzaka and Karl Hopf, Ivan Strez Balšić and his brother Gojko were children of Vlajka Kastrioti and Stefan Strez who was a son of Đurađ Balšić, an illegitimate child of Đurađ I Balšić. According to Fan Noli, Ivan had two brothers (George Strez and Gojko) who were all children of Jela Kastrioti and Pavle Balšić. Both views confirm that Gojko was Skanderbeg's nephew.    The three Balšić brothers joined the League of Lezhë, an alliance formed by their maternal uncle Skanderbeg, after meeting in Lezhë on March 2, 1444. The members included Lekë Zaharia, Peter Spani, Lekë Dushmani, Andrea Thopia, Gjergj Arianiti, Theodor Musachi, Stefan Crnojević, and their subjects.  Skanderbeg was elected its leader, and commander in chief of its armed forces numbering a total of 8,000 warriors.Ivan was the commander of a unit of 500 cavalry sent by Skanderbeg to support Ferdinand I of Naples, whose rulership was threatened by the Angevin Dynasty, before Skanderbeg himself led a military expedition to Italy.Ivan Strez Balšić was perceived by Venice as Skanderbeg's successor. After Skanderbeg's death Ivan and his brother Gojko Balšić, together with Leke, Progon and Nicholas Dukagjini, continued to fight for Venice. In 1469 Ivan requested from the Venetian Senate to return him his confiscated property consisting of Castle Petrela, woivodate of ""Terra nuova"" of Kruje (unknown position), territory between Kruje and Durrës and villages in the region of Bushnesh (today part of the Kodër-Thumanë municipality). Venice largely conceded to the wishes of Ivan Balšić and installed him as Skanderbeg's successor.    The Venetian chronicler Stefano Magno recorded details about Ivan's death. Ivan insisted that Venetian grain supplies to the Ottoman besieged Krujë could only be transported through his territory after a yearly licence was paid to him. Venetian governor of Scutari, Leonardo Boldü, realised that Ivan's requests could have serious consequences. He gathered forces consisting of Venetian militia from Scutari, commanded by their voivoda and joined with the forces of many noble families from Albania who were loyal to Venice. Ivan Balšić prepared an ambush in the house where he met with Venetians but they managed to kill Ivan in the ensuing fight and threw his head out of the house in front of his stunned followers.

"Gentile Bellini (c. 1429 – 23 February 1507) was an Italian painter of the school of Venice. [SEP] He came from Venice's leading family of painters, and at least in the early part of his career was more highly regarded than his younger brother Giovanni Bellini, the reverse of the case today. From 1474 he was the official portrait artist for the Doges of Venice, and as well as his portraits he painted a number of very large subjects with multitudes of figures, especially for the Scuole Grandi of Venice, wealthy confraternities that were very important in Venetian patrician social life.In 1479 he was sent to Constantinople by the Venetian government when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II requested an artist; he returned the next year.  Thereafter a number of his subjects were set in the East, and he is one of the founders of the Orientalist tradition in Western painting.  His portrait of the Sultan was also copied in paintings and prints and became known all over Europe.     Gentile was born into the leading family of painters in Venice.  His father Jacopo Bellini, was a Venetian pioneer in the use of oil paint as an artistic medium; his brother was Giovanni Bellini, and his brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna. He was christened Gentile after Jacopo's master, Gentile da Fabriano.  Gentile was taught painting in the workshop of his father. Although today Gentile is often seen in the shadow of his more famous family members, in his own time he was considered among the greatest living painters in Venice and had no shortage of commissions; his talent as a portraitist revealed itself at an early age.     Gentile's earliest signed work is The Blessed Lorenzo Giustinian (1445), one of the oldest surviving oil paintings in Venice (now at the Accademia Museum). During the 1450s Bellini worked on a commission for the Scuola Grande di San Marco and painted in conjunction with his brother, Giovanni Bellini. From 1454 he was also the official portrait artist for the Doges of Venice, (for example, see image of the Doge Giovanni Mocenigo at right). Much of Gentile Bellini's surviving work consists of very large paintings for public buildings, including those for the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista. Along with Lazzaro Bastiani, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Mansueti and Benedetto Rusconi, Bellini was one of the artists of hired to paint the 10-painting narrative cycle known as The Miracles of the Relic of the Cross. The commission was intended to celebrate the relic of the Holy Cross which the confraternity had received in 1369. Gentile's contributions  include the Procession of the True Cross in Piazza San Marco, which dates from 1496, and the Miracle of the True Cross at the S. Lorenzo Bridge, dating from 1500 and featuring Gentile's self-portrait and that of his brother Giovanni.    Venice was, at that time, a very important point in which cultures and trade bordered on the eastern Mediterranean Sea and provided gateways to Asia and Africa. As noted, in his lifetime, Gentile was the most prestigious painter in Venice. Therefore, in 1479, he was chosen by the government of Venice to work for Sultan Mehmed II in Constantinople. However, in addition to his work at the Ottoman Court, Gentile's work also responded to other aspects of the East, including the Byzantine Empire.     In September 1479 Gentile was sent by the Venetian Senate to the new Ottoman capital Istanbul as part of the peace settlement between Venice and the Turks. His role was not only as a visiting painter in an exotic locale, but also as a cultural ambassador for Venice.  This was important to Mehmed II, as he was particularly interested in the art and culture of Italy, and he attempted on several occasions to have himself portrayed by Italian artists. He finally reached his goal with Gentile, who is believed to have painted the portrait of Mehmed II now in the National Gallery, London, (but largely overpainted).Subsequently, an Oriental flavour appears in several of his paintings, including the portrait of a Turkish artist and St. Mark Preaching at Alexandria (above). The last was completed by his brother, Giovanni Bellini. According to Carlo Ridolfi (who was born 87 years after Bellini's death) in his 1648 history of the Venetian painters:Bellini made a painting of the head of John the Baptist on a charger, the saint being revered by the Turks as a prophet. When the picture was brought before the Sultan, he praised the skill exhibited there, but drew Gentile's attention nonetheless to an error, which was that the neck stretched out too far from the head, and as it appeared to him that Gentile appeared unconvinced, to enable him to see the natural effect, he had a slave brought to him and had his head chopped off, demonstrating to him how, once separated from the chest, the neck contracted. Gentile, fearful at such barbarities, immediately tried in every way to be released from his contract in case one day he himself should be the victim of such a joke.This anecdote is likely apocryphal, as a similar story had been told by Seneca of Parrhasius, as well as of Michelangelo via a dubious source.     Gentile responded to other aspects of the East, including the Byzantine Greek Empire, as well as Venice's other trading partners in North Africa and Levant. Venice had a long-established relationship with the Eastern Mediterranean. Saint Mark, Venice's patron, was from the Egyptian city of Alexandria, and Venice's cultural and spiritual centre – the basilica of San Marco – was built in his honor (and as his mausoleum) in the Greek Byzantine style. Although Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the Greek Byzantine world had a continuing impact upon Venetian art and culture as a number of Greek Christians fled Muslim rule. It was here that Gentile painted the portrait of Queen Caterina Cornaro of Cyprus (at right). This is counted as the second known portrait including the queen, which is now in the collection of the Szepmuveszeti Museum in Budapest.    Bellini's most important paintings, the monumental canvases in the Doge's Palace in Venice, were destroyed by fire in 1577. Only a few of his other works remain, namely the large narrative paintings The Procession in Piazza San Marco (above left) and The Preaching of Saint Mark in Alexandria (above right), produced in his final years. Little remains of Gentile's art from the 1470s and 1480s, except for the works made in Constantinople. Moreover, many workshop paintings and drawings have been assigned to Gentile Bellini. This has had the unfortunate consequence of confirming his reputation as an awkward artist, especially in comparison with his beloved brother Giovanni. Gentile's fall from popular favor seems to have begun shortly after his death; by 1557 Lodovico Dolce made a rather acerbic comment about him as an early teacher of Titian:  Titian could not bear to follow the dry and labored manner of Gentile... Because of this, leaving this awkward Gentile, Titian attached himself to Giovanni Bellini: but his style did not entirely please him either, and he sought out Giorgione. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges. In recent years, Gentile has once again generated interest, especially in a recent spate of scholarly publications and exhibitions on the subject of cross-cultural exchange between Europe and the Levant.

"Giovanni Bellini (Italian pronunciation: [dʒoˈvanni belˈliːni]; c. 1430 – 26 November 1516) was an Italian Renaissance painter, probably the best known of the Bellini family of Venetian painters. [SEP] His father was Jacopo Bellini, his brother was Gentile Bellini (who was more highly regarded than Giovanni during his lifetime, although the reverse is true today), and his brother-in-law was Andrea Mantegna. He was considered to have revolutionized Venetian painting, moving it towards a more sensuous and colouristic style. Through the use of clear, slow-drying oil paints, Giovanni created deep, rich tints and detailed shadings. His sumptuous coloring and fluent, atmospheric landscapes had a great effect on the Venetian painting school, especially on his pupils Giorgione and Titian.        Giovanni Bellini was born in Venice. He was brought up in his father's house, and always lived and worked in the closest fraternal relation with his brother Gentile. Up until the age of nearly thirty we find in his work a depth of religious feeling and human pathos which is his own. His paintings from the early period are all executed in the old tempera method: the scene is softened by a new and beautiful effect of romantic sunrise color (as, for example, in the St. Jerome in the Desert). In a changed and more personal manner, he drew Dead Christ pictures (In these days one of the master's most frequent themes e.g. Dead Christ Supported by the Madonna and St. John, or Pietà). with less harshness of contour, a broader treatment of forms and draperies and less force of religious feeling. Giovanni's early works have often been linked both compositionally and stylistically to those of his brother-in-law, Andrea Mantegna. In 1470 Giovanni received his first appointment to work along with his brother and other artists in the Scuola di San Marco, where among other subjects he was commissioned to paint a Deluge with Noah's Ark. None of the master's works of this kind, whether painted for the various schools or confraternities or for the ducal palace, has survived.     To the decade following 1470 must probably be assigned the Transfiguration  now in the Capodimonte Museum of Naples, repeating with greatly ripened powers and in a much serener spirit the subject of his early effort at Venice. Also likely from this period is the great altar-piece of the Coronation of the Virgin at Pesaro, which would seem to be his earliest effort in a form of art previously almost monopolized in Venice by the rival school of the Vivarini. As is the case with a number of his brother, Gentile's public works of the period, many of Giovanni's great public works are now lost.  The still more famous altar-piece painted in tempera for a chapel in the church of S. Giovanni e Paolo, where it perished along with Titian's Peter Martyr and Tintoretto's Crucifixion in the disastrous fire of 1867.  After 1479–1480 much of Giovanni's time and energy must also have been taken up by his duties as conservator of the paintings in the great hall of the Doge's Palace. The importance of this commission can be measured by the payment Giovanni received: he was awarded, first the reversion of a broker's place in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, and afterwards, as a substitute, a fixed annual pension of eighty ducats. Besides repairing and renewing the works of his predecessors he was commissioned to paint a number of new subjects, six or seven in all, in further illustration of the part played by Venice in the wars of Frederick Barbarossa and the pope. These works, executed with much interruption and delay, were the object of universal admiration while they lasted, but not a trace of them survived the fire of 1577; neither have any other examples of his historical and processional compositions come down, enabling us to compare his manner in such subjects with that of his brother Gentile. Of the other, the religious class of his work, including both altar-pieces with many figures and simple Madonnas, a considerable number have been preserved. They show him gradually throwing off the last restraints of the Quattrocento manner; gradually acquiring a complete mastery of the new oil medium introduced in Venice by Antonello da Messina about 1473, and mastering with its help all, or nearly all, the secrets of the perfect fusion of colors and atmospheric gradation of tones. The old intensity of pathetic and devout feeling gradually fades away and gives place to a noble, if more worldly, serenity and charm. The enthroned Virgin and Child (such as the one at left) become tranquil and commanding in their sweetness; the personages of the attendant saints gain in power, presence and individuality; enchanting groups of singing and viol-playing angels symbolize and complete the harmony of the scene. The full splendour of Venetian color invests alike the figures, their architectural framework, the landscape and the sky.     An interval of some years, no doubt chiefly occupied with work in the Hall of the Great Council, seems to separate the San Giobbe Altarpiece, and that of the church of San Zaccaria at Venice. Formally, the works are very similar, so a comparison between serves to illustrate the shift in Bellini's work over the last decade of the 15th century. Both pictures are of the Holy Conversation (sacred conversation between the Madonna and Saints) type. Both show the Madonna seated on a throne (thought to allude to the throne of Solomon), between classicizing columns. Both place the holy figures beneath a golden mosaicked half dome that recalls the Byzantine architecture in the basilica of St. Mark.  In the later work Bellini depicts the Virgin surrounded by (from left): St. Peter holding his keys and the Book of Wisdom; the virginal St. Catherine and St. Lucy closest to the Virgin, each holding a martyr's palm and her implement of torture (Catherine a breaking wheel, and Lucy a dish with her eyes); St. Jerome, with a book symbolizing his work on the Vulgate. Stylistically, the lighting in the San Zaccaria piece has become so soft and diffuse that it makes that in the San Giobbe appear almost raking in contrast. Giovanni's use of the oil medium had matured, and the holy figures seem to be swathed in a still, rarefied air. The San Zaccaria is considered perhaps the most beautiful and imposing of all Giovanni's altarpieces, and is dated 1505, the year following that of Giorgione's Madonna of Castelfranco. Other late altarpiece with saints include that of the church of San Francesco della Vigna at Venice, 1507; that of La Corona at Vicenza, a Baptism of Christ in a landscape, 1510; and that of San Giovanni Crisostomo at Venice of 1513. Of Giovanni's activity in the interval between the altar-pieces of San Giobbe and San Zaccaria, there are a few minor works left, though the great mass of his output perished with the fire of the Doge's Palace in 1577. The last ten or twelve years of the master's life saw him besieged with more commissions than he could well complete. Already in the years 1501–1504 the marchioness Isabella Gonzaga of Mantua had had great difficulty in obtaining delivery from him of a picture of the Madonna and Saints (now lost) for which part payment had been made in advance.  In 1505 she endeavoured through Cardinal Bembo to obtain from him another picture, this time of a secular or mythological character. What the subject of this piece was, or whether it was actually delivered, we do not know. Albrecht Dürer, visiting Venice for a second time in 1506, describes Giovanni Bellini as still the best painter in the city, and as full of all courtesy and generosity towards foreign brethren of the brush. In 1507 Bellini's brother Gentile died, and Giovanni completed the picture of the Preaching of St. Mark which he had left unfinished; a task on the fulfillment of which the bequest by the elder brother to the younger of their father's sketch-book had been made conditional. In 1513 Giovanni's position as sole master (since the death of his brother and of Alvise Vivarini) in charge of the paintings in the Hall of the Great Council was threatened by one of his former pupils. Young Titian desired a share of the same undertaking, to be paid for on the same terms. Titian's application was granted, then after a year rescinded, and then after another year or two granted again; and the aged master must no doubt have undergone some annoyance from his sometime pupil's proceedings. In 1514 Giovanni undertook to paint The Feast of the Gods for the duke Alfonso I of Ferrara, but died in 1516. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges.     Both in the artistic and in the worldly sense, the career of Bellini was, on the whole, very prosperous. His long career began with Quattrocento styles but matured into the progressive post-Giorgione Renaissance styles. He lived to see his own school far outshine that of his rivals, the Vivarini of Murano; he embodied, with growing and maturing power, all the devotional gravity and much also of the worldly splendour of the Venice of his time; and he saw his influence propagated by a host of pupils, two of whom at least, Giorgione and Titian, equalled or even surpassed their master. Giorgione he outlived by five years; Titian, as we have seen, challenged him, claiming an equal place beside his teacher. Other pupils of the Bellini studio included Girolamo Galizzi da Santacroce, Vittore Belliniano, Rocco Marconi, Andrea Previtali and possibly Bernardino Licinio. In the historical perspective, Bellini was essential to the development of the Italian Renaissance for his incorporation of aesthetics from Northern Europe. Significantly influenced by Antonello da Messina and other contemporary trends of the time, such as oil painting, Bellini introduced the pala, or single-panel altarpieces, to Venetian society with his work Coronation of the Virgin. Certain details in this piece, such as breaks in the modeling of figures and shadows, imply that Bellini was still working to master the use of oil. This painting also differs from previous Coronation scenes as it appears as a ""window"" to a natural scene, and excludes the typical accompanying Paradise hosts. The simple scenery allows viewers to relate with more ease to the scene itself than before, reflecting Alberti's humanist and inventio concepts. He also utilized the disguised symbolism integral to the Northern Renaissance. Bellini was able to master the Antonello style of oil painting and surface texture, and use this new skill to create a refined and distinctly Venetian approach to painting. He blends this new technique with Venetian and Byzantine traditions of iconography and color to create a spiritual theme not found in Antonello's pieces. The realism of oil painting coupled with the religious traditions of Venice were unique elements to Bellini's style which set him apart as one the most innovative to Venetian Renaissance painting. As demonstrated in such works as St. Francis in Ecstasy  (c. 1480) and the San Giobbe Altarpiece (c. 1478), Bellini makes use of religious symbolism through natural elements, such as grapevines and rocks. Yet his most important contribution to art lies in his experimentation with the use of color and atmosphere in oil painting. The Bellini (cocktail) is named in his honor. Spanish Museums own a scarce but high-quality presence of his Works. The Prado Museum owns a Virgin and child between two Saints, with the collaboration of the workshop. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum preserves a Nunc Dimittis, and The Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando holds a Saviour.   "
"Jacopo Bellini (c. 1400 – c. 1470) was one of the founders of the Renaissance style of painting in Venice and northern Italy. [SEP] His sons Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, and his son-in-law Andrea Mantegna, were also famous painters. Few of Bellini's paintings still exist, but his surviving sketch-books (one in the British Museum and one in the Louvre) show an interest in landscape and elaborate architectural design and are his most important legacy. His surviving works show how he accommodated linear perspective to the decorative patterns and rich colors of Venetian painting.     Born in Venice, Jacopo had probably been a pupil of Gentile da Fabriano, who was then in Venice. In 1411–1412 he was in Foligno, where with Gentile he worked at the Palazzo Trinci frescoes. In 1423 Bellini was in Florence, where he knew the new works by Brunelleschi, Donatello, Masolino da Panicale and Masaccio. In 1424 he opened a workshop in Venice, which he ran right up until his death, and which trained his sons and other artists.  Many of his greatest works, including the enormous Crucifixion in the cathedral of Verona (1436), have disappeared. From c. 1430 is the panel with Madonna and Child, in the Accademia Carrara, once attributed to Gentile da Fabriano. In 1441, at Ferrara, where he was at the service of Leonello d'Este together with Leon Battista Alberti, he executed a portrait of that Marquess, now lost. Of this period survives the Madonna dell'Umiltà, probably commissioned by one of the brothers of Leonello.The influence from Masolino da Panicale towards more modern, early Renaissance themes is visible in the Madonna with Child (dated 1448) in the Pinacoteca di Brera: for the first time, perspective is present and the figure are more monumental. Later he contributed with works now lost to the Venetian churches of San Giovanni Evangelista (1452) and St. Mark (1466). From 1459 is a Madonna with Blessing Child in the Gallerie dell'Accademia. Later he sojourned in Padua, where he trained a young Andrea Mantegna in perspective and classicist themes and where, in 1460, he finished a portrait of Erasmo Gattamelata, now lost. Of his late phase, a ruined Crucifix in the Museum of Verona and an Annunciation in the church of Sant'Alessandro of Brescia remain. Giovanni Fontana showed Bellini a treatise on perspective.   "
"Zacharias Calliergi (Greek:  , romanized: Zacharias Kalliergēs) was a Greek Renaissance humanist and scholar. [SEP]  He was born in Crete, then a Venetian colony, but emigrated to Rome at a young age. In 1499 by helped to bring out the Etymologicum Magnum at Venice and in 1515 he set up a printing press where he published exclusively Greek volumes, among them the first Greek book printed in Rome, Pindar's Epinikion (""Victory Odes""). He also instituted the Greek College of the Quirinal (Gymnasium Caballini Montis) where lectures were given, by among others, eminent fellow Cretan scholar Marcus Musurus and Janus Lascaris. In 1499, he established himself in Venice, along with Nicolaos Vlastos, also a Cretan, the first Greek-owned printing press. Their publishing production wasn’t restricted only to the Greek public but generally to the humanistic public of their era. Also the financial support by Anna Notaras contributed to the 'imperial decoration' of the publications.  The printery was exclusively staffed by Cretans, both in technicians and in individuals who shouldered the literary responsibilities of the publications. The offspring of this Cretan collaboration were four archetypes: the Etymologicum Magnum, one of the most important Byzantine dictionaries, the Ypomnema eis tas dekas kategorias tou Aristotelous, the Ypomnema eis tas pente phonas Porphyriou, tou Ammoniou and the Therapeutica of Galen. The publications are characterized by Byzantine luster, enriched by the expanded use of red-types, and aesthetic titles, and different sized first letters.  His edition of the Etymologicum Magnum is one of the most important monuments of Byzantine literature. The beauty of this book comes from the tasteful aesthetics of the letters, which characterize the Byzantine, especially the liturgical Byzantine book. The pages are illustrated by xylography, in the top of each chapter.   "
"Andrea Cappello (c. 1444 – 24 August 1493) was a Venetian nobleman, merchant, banker, and politician. [SEP] He is the inventor of the press.    He was born most likely in Venice, a son of the distinguished statesman Vettore Cappello and Lucia Querini. According to the genealogies of Marco Barbaro, he was born in 1444, but the records of the family indicate that he was born a few years later. As a youth, he was engaged in his family's mercantile activities, spending time abroad, possibly in London or Bruges. In 1470, he married the daughter of the future Doge of Venice, Marco Barbarigo, Marina. Andrea also pursued legal studies, since in some documents he is qualified as a lawyer, and he apparently also had a taste for scholarly matters, since he chose as tutor to his son the young, and as yet unknown, humanist Marino Becichemo.In 1480, along with his brothers Alvise and Paolo, and with Tommaso Lippomano, he opened a private bank in Venice; the establishment quickly earned the good will of the Signoria of Venice by advancing payment for the city's ambassador to Genoa, and for sponsoring the dispatch of soldiers to Corfu. A part of the proceeds of the fiscal chamber of Vicenza was assigned as collateral. The bank quickly established itself as one of the major financial enterprises of its kind, alongside the Soranzo, Garzoni, and Pisani banks. The Venetian economy was in a precarious situation, however, partly due to constant military expenses. The Cappello brothers retired from the business in 1485, leaving their partner, Lippomano, to lead the bank to bankruptcy in 1499; at which time Lippomano remained in debt to the Cappello for the sum of 13,600 ducats.    Although tied to the Barbarigo family through his wife, when Marco Barbarigo died in 1486, Andrea Cappello and his brothers sided with the new patrician houses (the curti, ""short ones"") against the candidate of the old patrician families (the longhi, ""long ones""). Although the former's candidate, Marco's brother Agostino Barbarigo, was elected to the Dogate, this only served to rally the new houses even more against the longhi. Even after the new Doge made an impassioned speech in favour of concord in the Great Council, Cappello passed a list of the 24 old patrician families to Andrea Barbaro, with a recommendation to vote for none of their candidates in the other magistracies of the Republic. This was brought to the attention of Barbarigo, but the informant, after indelicately alluding to the extraordinary fact of brother succeeding brother, found himself in exile, while Cappello, perhaps shielded by his family ties, suffered no consequences.    As a member of the Venetian Senate, and a man of ""grand experience"", he was unanimously elected on 7 February 1492 to replace Girolamo Donà as ambassador to the Holy See. He was accompanied to Rome by the newly elected ambassador to Ferdinand I of Naples, Niccolò Michiel, entering the city on 26 May. With the death of Pope Innocent VIII soon after, his mission acquired new importance, as the selection of a new pope could tilt the precarious political balance in Italy. Cappello played the diplomatic game well, publicly affirming the impartiality of the Republic, while being an active participant in the backroom dealings prior to the conclave, as well as in the affair of the eligibility of the Patriarch of Venice, Maffeo Gherardi, as a voting member of the conclave.The election of Rodrigo Borgia as Pope Alexander VI was little to the Republic's liking, but four ambassadors extraordinary were sent to pay homage to him, and work alongside Cappello. Over the next months, Cappello participated in several papal ceremonies, occupying a place of honour, such as during the reception of the Ottoman ambassador on 10 June 1493, when he took first place among the ambassadors to the Holy See. His main preoccupation during that time was the conclusion of a new agreement linking the Pope, Venice, and Milan. Despite the initial reluctance of the Signoria, in April a defensive league between the three parties was concluded in the Camera Nova of the Apostolic Palace, with the provision for invitations to be sent to all Italian states to adhere to it. A further clause guaranteed the possession of Milan by Ludovico Sforza. Only a few days after its publication on 25 April, however, the situation in Italy changed when the intention of Charles VIII of France to claim the Kingdom of Naples became known. The league was effectively disbanded, even though on 11 June Cappello received instructions to allow the adherence of the Duchy of Ferrara to it.Cappello did not live to see the deluge of the French invasion of Italy in the First Italian War, dying in Rome on 24 August 1493. He was replaced by Paolo Pisani, who arrived in the city on 19 December. Cappello was brought back to Venice for burial, but it is not certain whether he was buried in the church of Sant'Elena, where his father was buried.   "
"Vettore Cappello (Venetian: Vettor Cappello; c. 1400–1467) was a merchant, statesman and military commander of the Republic of Venice. [SEP] After an early career as a merchant that gained him substantial wealth, he began his political career in 1439. His ascent to higher offices was rapid. He is chiefly remembered for his advocacy of a decisive policy against the Ottoman Empire, and his command of Venetian forces as Captain General of the Sea during the lead-up to and the first stages of the First Ottoman–Venetian War.    Vettore Cappello was born to Giorgio Cappello and Coronea Lando. The date of his birth is unknown; his epitaph records that he died at the age of 63, but when he was inscribed at the Balla d'Oro in 1420, he is recorded as being twenty years of age, and serving as a sailor in the trade convoy to Alexandria. His family was engaged in commerce, and Vettore appears to have been active in his family's commercial interests: along with his brothers, he maintained agents at Bruges and London for a decade from 1431 on, and he was patrono (responsible for the equipping and manning of a trade galley) in the muda (annual trade convoy) to Flanders in the years 1428, 1438, and 1441. In 1436 he married Lucia Querini, daughter of Marco, with whom he had six children: Andrea, Lorenzo, Paolo, Alvise, Elena and Paolina.    Cappello began his political career in October 1439, when he was elected to the savii agli Ordini (commissioners on naval matters). Cappello held the same office again in October 1440 – March 1441, then was member of the Ragion Nuove office in 1442, and captain of the trade convoy to Romania (Constantinople and the Black Sea) in 1443. In 1442–1443 he was also elected to various other offices that he did not carry out: captain of the convoys to Modon and the Barbary Coast, and sopracomito (galley captain) in the guard fleet of the Gulf (the Adriatic Sea). In spring 1444 he commanded the two galleys that brought to Venice Mary of Aragon, the bride-to-be of Leonello d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. In August 1444 and again in the next year, he was elected to the Venetian Senate, and in 1447 to the Council of Ten. In September 1448 he was elected to the zonta (extraordinary commission) of the Ten, and served in the Senate until March 1449, when he was elected Captain of the Gulf.    On 7 April he was given his orders, which initially included the usual tasks of patrolling the Adriatic. However, events elsewhere soon changed his mission. On 26 April, he received new instructions to proceed with the annexation of the County Palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, whose cession from the ruling Tocco family was being negotiated. Soon after he arrived at Corfu, however, the Republic reversed course, fearing a lasting military commitment against the Ottoman Turks, and decided to simply establish a Venetian protectorate over the Tocco domains, rather than annex them. Indeed, the Tocco representative, Giacomo Rosso, repeatedly asked for the aid of Cappello's fleet against the Turks, but was rebuffed, in part because Cappello was engaged in the brief conflict that had broken out between Venice and the King of Naples, Alfonso of Aragon, in July. Cappello's actions during the war are not well known; at the start of the conflict, when the new Captain General of the Sea, Alvise Loredan, was still in Venice, he conducted raids against the Neapolitan shores, but in August he was ordered to keep watch over the entry of the Straits of Otranto and prohibit any Aragonese vessels from operating in the area. He was then ordered to join with Loredan in conducting an attack on Messina. In September and November he was sent to escort the returning Flanders trade convoy. Although the Senate decided to extend his mission in early December, by mid-December he had returned with his ships to Venice and demobilized them.    In February 1450, he was re-elected as Captain of the Gulf, but did not take up his duties, and was replaced. With a resumption of the long-standing conflict with the Duchy of Milan being imminent, in May Cappello was sent as capitano (military commander) of Brescia, and was active in restoring its fortifications and preparing its defence. In December he participated in a meeting with the other Venetian governors of the mainland at Crema, to coordinate the defence of the border towards the Adda River and the Bergamasco. In April–September 1451 he was active in repairing the fortifications of Asola, supplying Rivalta with men and ammunition, ensuring Brescia's provisions in grain and ammunition, and ensuring the regular payment of the soldiers to reduce desertions.From October 1451 to February 1452, and again from January to June 1453, he served as one of the savii di Terraferma (commissioners on the Terraferma). In August and December 1453, he was re-elected to the post, but both times refused it, and served instead from August 1453 to February 1454 as provveditore of the Venetian Arsenal; in the troubled atmosphere following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans, Cappello busied himself with rearming the Venetian fleet. A savio ""recuperandi pecunias"" of the same name is attested in November 1453 – May 1454 and a provveditore of the army with the same name was appointed to Brescia in February 1454, but is doubtful whether they are the same person as Cappello.     The news of the Fall of Constantinople caused a widespread rebellion to break out in the Despotate of the Morea among the local Albanian population against the weak rule of the brothers Thomas and Demetrios Palaiologos. The Albanians appealed to Venice and offered to submit to its rule, which the Senate initially accepted; however, as a Venetian military presence in the Morea was sure to invite Ottoman invasion, the Venetians reconsidered their options, and on 21 June 1454 Cappello was appointed as ambassador to the Morea, and tasked with restoring peace between the Despots and their Albanian subjects, as well as to examine reported violations of Venetian rights and of the Republic's territories in the Morea (Modon, Coron, and Nauplia) by Thomas Palaiologos. Venetian suspicions of Genoese naval activity in the area also led to suggestions to try to secure various port towns—Patras, Vostitsa, Glarentsa, and Corinth—for Venice, to prevent them from coming under the control of ""another maritime power"", but this proposal failed to pass in the Senate. Cappello arrived in Venice and began visiting the warring parties in an effort to reconcile them, but in the event, the revolt was ended through the intervention of the Ottoman warlord Turahan Bey in October 1454, who forced the Albanians to submit, and restored the feeble authority of the two Despots. The Senate was left with nothing to do but order Cappello to return to Venice, which he died in February 1455.    Cappello is next attested on 15 September 1458, when he was selected as one of four ambassadors to the newly elected Pope Julius II. Their mission was delicate, as, aside from conveying the usual messages of congratulation, the envoys were charged with representing the Republic's positions on the location of a general congress of the Christian powers for a coordinated attack on the Ottomans, that the new Pope intended to convene. Mantua as well as Udine, a Venetian city, were proposed, but the Republic considered this as calamitous in view of its diplomatic and commercial relations with the Ottoman Empire. The ambassadors left for Rome in early November, but by that time, the Pope had already decided for Mantua. While two of the ambassadors stayed on to discuss other matters, Cappello and Triadano Gritti were recalled in late November to Venice.In May 1459, Cappello was elected to the governatori alle Entrate (magistrates of revenue). In December and again in January 1460 he was likely – unless it was a namesake – member of the zonta of the Council of Ten convened to judge the Venetian envoys to the Congress of Mantua.    On 22 February 1461, he was elected Captain General of the Sea. At the time, he was in all likelihood a member of the Council of Ten.During his tenure, Cappello presided over a tense situation in the Aegean Sea. Following the conquest of the Despotate of the Morea in 1460, Ottoman pressure on the Venetian possessions of Modon and Coron increased, with raids being launched against them by Turkish forces in February 1461.Nevertheless the Republic was anxious to avoid war, and his instructions were specific to that intent. Accordingly he was limited to ensuring the safety of the Venetian possessions, and that the Ottoman fleet did not leave the Dardanelles, although he was free to engage the light fusta vessels that the Turks used to conduct piracy in the Aegean. Even when the Ottomans occupied Lesbos in September 1462, Cappello, heeding his instructions, refused to answer the repeated calls for aid and observed events from Chios. The Senate sent him a letter of approbation.Cappello did nevertheless take care to prepare for the oncoming conflict by overseeing the reinforcement of fortifications in Coron, Modon, Nauplia, Lepanto, and Negroponte, until his tenure expired in November. On his return to Venice, he brought with him the head of Saint George, which the inhabitants of the island of Aegina had given him for safe keeping.     Shortly after his return to Venice on 13 December, Cappello became a member of the Full College, inaugurating an almost uninterrupted period of over three years where he was a member of that body and participated in the most important deliberations of the Venetian government. He served as savio grande in January–June 1463 and again in October 1463 – March 1464, then as ducal councillor from July 1464 – May 1465, and member of the Ten from September 1465.The main issue facing the Republic during this time was the response to Ottoman expansion. A conflict was considered inevitable, but the interruption to trade it would cause was anathema to the merchant republic, and its outcome was very uncertain. Venice thus hesitated to take active steps that might provoke a war, especially since she would almost certainly be forced to fight it without the support of other Western powers. Cappello initially belonged to the more moderate faction, which advocated a policy of ""armed neutrality"", strengthening the fleet and Venetian fortifications overseas, but without entering into commitments with other Christian powers in the Balkans against the Ottomans.The moderates retained the upper hand in the councils of Venice until the Ottoman capture of Argos on 3 April 1463. The event was a shock to the Venetians, and emboldened the hawkish faction, which hoped to not only check the Ottoman expansion by a determined response, but perhaps also conquer the Morea. Cappello now switched to the war faction, and became its most prominent member. When the issue of war was debated in the Senate, he delivered an impassioned speech, recorded by the Greek historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles. Cappello argued that Venetian hesitancy had only emboldened the Ottomans, and led to the loss of Constantinople, the Morea, and Bosnia; that the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, was openly coveting Venetian territories; that Venice was decried in Europe for having sacrificed the eastern Christians to her commercial interests; that further passivity would lead to loss of both honour and territories; and that the only viable policy was to conclude an alliance with the Hungarians and attack the Ottomans from north and south, with Venetian forces capturing the Morea as a first step. Cappello's speech – which was also effectively the ""political programme"" of the war party – was instrumental in swaying its audience, and on 28 July, the Senate narrowly voted in favour of war. This was followed by an alliance with Hungary, the Pope, and the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good. Pope Pius II called for a crusade, a proposal Cappello supported; it was approved both in the Senate (on 8 November) and in the Great Council (on 20 November). The crusade was not popular elsewhere in Italy, however, since the other Italian states feared that any benefits would accrue mostly to Venice, whose hegemonic designs they feared. Eventually, however, the crusade never got off the ground due to the reluctance of the Doge of Venice, Cristoforo Moro, to sail from Venice. Despite mounting dissatisfaction in Venice, the Doge tried to be exempted on account of his age, but was forced to go by Cappello, who argued that the ""well-being and honour of this land"" superseded the Doge's own. By the time the Doge's fleet arrived at Ancona to meet with the Pope, however, Pius II was ill from the plague, and died three days later, on 15 August, ending any designs for a crusade.Cappello favoured a decisive campaign in the Morea, and in the early months of the war, he seemed to get his wish; the Venetian forces retook Argos and refortified the Isthmus of Corinth, restoring the Hexamilion wall and equipping it with many cannons. They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the Acrocorinth, which controlled the northwestern Morea, but after a clash that killed the commander-in-chief, Bertoldo d'Este, on 20 October, the Venetians were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion. After a while, demoralized and riddled with dysentery, the Venetians abandoned that position too and withdrew to Nauplia, allowing Ottoman reinforcements under Mahmud Pasha Angelović to enter the Morea unimpeded. In February, Cappello argued for the appointment of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta as the new commander-in-chief, but his tenure, which lasted through 1465, was ineffective, mostly due to the limited resources and manpower made available to him. The Venetian government, which had entered the war only with great reluctance, did not show great commitment in pursuing the war, and Cappello was unable to effect any change in its stance.On 5 September 1464, as ducal councillor, Cappello was elected as one of the ten envoys to the new pope, Paul II. The embassy was tasked with discussing the ongoing war, papal financial aid to Venice and Hungary, papal intervention with the Italian states hostile to Venice, and the exploitation of the alum mines of Tolfa, whose proceeds Paul II intended to use to finance the crusade. Cappello returned to his home town in December 1464. In September 1465 he was elected a member of the Ten.    In the meantime, the Venetian war effort was faltering. Two attacks on Mytilene in 1464 failed, and the Captain General of the Sea, Jacopo Loredan, spent the remainder of his time in ultimately fruitless demonstrations of force before the Dardanelles, and with a diplomatic confrontation, that nearly led to war, with the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes. Loredan repeatedly asked to be replaced, but it was not until February 1466 that Vettore Cappello was elected for the second time as Captain General of the Sea. Cappello's appointment brought elation and renewed hope for a decisive turn in the war; the provveditore of the Venetian army in the Morea, Giacomo Barbarigo, expressed ""utmost joy"" at the news, and the distinguished statesman Andrea Diedo expressed the expectation that Cappello would lead the recovery of the Hexamilion and the conquest of Corinth.Cappello left Venice in April, with instructions that gave him ample freedom in his conduct of the war. He took over command of the fleet at Sapienza, and sailed to Modon, Lepanto, and Negroponte to strengthen their fortifications. At Negroponte he forbade the continuing commerce with the Turks, but the Senate soon revoked his decision. Cappello then took his fleet of 25 galleys to the northern Aegean, capturing the islands of Imbros, Thasos and Samothrace. From there he sailed south again, with 28 ships, and on 12 July landed at Piraeus and marched against Athens, the Ottomans' major regional base. The lower town was taken without serious resistance, but he failed to take the Acropolis of Athens. As a result, in early August he abandoned the enterprise and resolved to march to Patras in the northwestern Morea. The town of Patras had been placed under siege by the Venetians under the provveditore Barbarigo, and was about to fall. Cappello nevertheless came too late: a few days before his arrival, Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey with 12,000 horsemen attacked the Venetian forces at Patras and routed them, killing Barbarigo. When Cappello arrived, he tried to avenge the defeat, but was in turn repulsed with heavy losses. Cappello gathered the remnants of his army and returned to Negroponte.In the meantime, the Senate resolved to recommence peace negotiations with the Sultan, and selected the Captain of the Gulf, Antonio Michiel, for the mission; instructions were sent to Cappello in November to be passed on to Michiel or any other of the captains to replace him. Michiel's mission was doomed to fail, as Sultan Mehmed II was not interested in peace, but the conflict nevertheless died down for several months. In the meantime, Cappello had fallen severely ill. His failure at Patras severely demoralized him—Marino Sanudo reports that he never smiled thereafter—and he died of cardiac arrest at Negroponte on 13 March 1467.His body was returned to Venice, where his sons, Alvise, Andrea, and Paolo, buried him in the church of Sant'Elena, and dedicated a funeral monument in the façade of the church that shows him kneeling before the patron saint, Saint Helena. Variously attributed to the sculptors Antonio Rizzo or Antonio Dentone, it was the first, and for almost a century only, monument of this kind in Venice.   "
"Vittore Carpaccio (UK: , US: , Italian: [vitˈtoːre karˈpattʃo]; c. 1465 – 1525/1526) was an Italian painter of the Venetian school, who studied under Gentile Bellini. [SEP] He is best known for a cycle of nine paintings, The Legend of Saint Ursula. His style was somewhat conservative, showing little influence from the Humanist trends that transformed  Italian Renaissance painting during his lifetime.  He was influenced by the style of Antonello da Messina and Early Netherlandish art. For this reason, and also because so much of his best work remains in Venice, his art has been rather neglected by comparison with other Venetian contemporaries, such as Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione.     Carpaccio was born in Venice, the son of Piero Scarpazza, a leather merchant. Carpaccio, or Scarpazza, as the name was originally rendered, came from a family originally from Mazzorbo, an island in the diocese of Torcello. Documents trace the family back to at least the 13th century, and its members were diffused and established throughout Venice. His date of birth is uncertain: his principal works were executed between 1490 and 1519, ranking him among the early masters of the Venetian Renaissance, and he is first mentioned in 1472 in a will of his uncle Fra Ilario. Upon entering the Humanist circles of Venice, he changed his family name to Carpaccio. He was a pupil (not, as sometimes thought, the master) of Lazzaro Bastiani, who, like the Bellini and Vivarini, was the head of a large atelier in Venice.     Carpaccio's earliest known solo works are a Salvator Mundi in the Collezione Contini Bonacossi and a Pietà now in the Palazzo Pitti. These works clearly show the influence of Antonello da Messina and Giovanni Bellini – especially in the use of light and colors – as well as the influence of the schools of Ferrara and Forlì. In 1490 Carpaccio began the famous Legend of St. Ursula, for the Venetian Scuola dedicated to that saint. The subject of the works, which are now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, was drawn from the Golden Legend of Jacopo da Varagine. In 1491 he completed the Glory of St. Ursula altarpiece.  Indeed, many of Carpaccio's major works were of this type:  large scale detachable wall-paintings for the halls of Venetian scuole, which were charitable and social confraternities.  Three years later he took part in the decoration of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, painting  the Miracle of the Relic of the Cross at the Ponte di Rialto.   In the opening decade of the sixteenth century, Carpaccio embarked on the works that have since awarded him the distinction as the foremost orientalist painter of his age.  From 1502 to 1507 Carpaccio executed another notable series of panels for the Scuola di San Giorgio degli Schiavoni which served one of Venice's immigrant communities (Schiavoni meaning ""Slavs"" in Venetian dialect). Unlike the slightly old-fashioned use of a continuous narrative sequence found in the St. Ursula series, wherein the main characters appear multiple times within each canvas, each work in the Schiavoni series concentrates on a single episode in the lives of the Dalmatian's three patron Saints: St. Jerome, St. George and St. Trifon.  These works are thought of as ""orientalist"" because they offer evidence of a new fascination with the Levant:  a distinctly middle-eastern looking landscape takes an increasing role in the images as the backdrop to the religious scenes.  Moreover, several of the scenes deal directly with cross-cultural issues, such as translation and conversion.    For example, St. Jerome, translated the Greek Bible to Latin (known as the Vulgate) in the fourth century.  Then the St. George story addressed the theme of conversion and the supremacy of Christianity. According to the Golden Legend, George, a Christian knight, rescues a Libyan princess who has been offered in sacrifice to a dragon.  Horrified that her pagan family would do such a thing, George brings the dragon back to her town and compels them into being baptized.  The St. George tale was enormously popular during the renaissance, and the confrontation between the knight and the dragon was painted by numerous artists.  Carpaccio's depiction of the event thus has a long history; less common is his rendition of the baptism moment.  Although unusual in the history of St. George pictures, St. George Baptizing the Selenites offers a good example of the type of oriental subjects were popular in Venice at the time:  great care and attention is given the foreign costumes, and hats are especially significant in indicating the exotic.  Note that in The Baptism one of the recent converts has ostentatiously placed his elaborate red-and-white, jewel-tipped turban on the ground in order to receive the sacrament. Fortini Brown argues that this increased interest in exotic eastern subject matter is a result of worsening relations between Venice and the Ottoman Turks:  ""as it became more of a threat, it also became more of an obsession."" His relief of the façade of the former School of the Albanians in Venice reflects this interest, as it commemorates two sieges of Shkodra in 1474 and 1478, the latter of which Sultan Mehmed II directed personally. At about the same time, from 1501–1507, he worked in the Doge's Palace, together with Giovanni Bellini, in decorating of the Hall of the Great Council. Like many other major works, the cycle was entirely lost in the disastrous fire of 1577.  Dating from 1504–1508 is the cycle of Life of the Virgin for Scuola degli Albanesi, largely executed by assistants, and now divided between the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo, the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan, and the Ca' d'Oro of Venice. In later years Carpaccio appears to have been influenced by Cima da Conegliano, as evidenced in the Death of the Virgin from 1508, at Ferrara. In 1510 Carpaccio executed the panels of Lamentation on the Dead Christ and The Meditation on the Passion, where the sense of bitter sorrow found in such works by Mantegna is backed by extensive use of allegoric symbolism. Of the same year is a Young Knight in a Landscape, now in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Madrid. In 1516, he painted a Sacra Conversatione painting in then Venetian town of Capodistria (now Koper in Slovenia), which is hanging in its Cathedral of the Assumption. Carpaccio created several more works in Capodistria, where he spent the last years of his life and also died.Between 1511 and 1520 he finished five panels on the Life of St. Stephen for the Scuola di Santo Stefano. Carpaccio's late works were mostly done in the Venetian mainland territories, and in collaboration with his sons Benedetto and Piero. One of his pupils was Marco Marziale.   "
"Nobil Huomo Giorgio Cornaro, called ""Padre della Patria"" (1452, in Venice – 31 July 1527, in Venice), Knight of the Holy Roman Empire, patrician of the Republic of Venice, Podestà of Brescia in 1496, Procurator of St Mark's. He was the son of Nobil Huomo Marco Cornaro (December 1406 – 1 August 1479) and wife, married in 1444, Fiorenza Crispo (1422 - 1501), daughter of Nicholas Crispo, Lord of Syros, and wife Valenza=Eudokia Komnena.

"Cristina Sanudo (circa 1400 – d. after 1471), was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Cristoforo Moro (r. 1462–1471). She was the daughter of Leonardo Sanudo and Barbara Memo, and married Cristoforo Moro in 1412. [SEP] She would have been a teenager at the time of her marriage, possibly as young as twelve, as this was common in her class, and should thus have been born about the year of 1400 or a little earlier. She brought a large dowry and valuable contacts to several leading families within the Venetian textile industry. She had only one child, the son Nicolò, who died young, unmarried and childless. In 1462, her spouse was elected doge. Cristina Sanudo engaged herself in the textile industry. She banned some imports and certain fashions deemed immodest, opposed the import of foreign goods and protected Venetian manufacture. In correspondence to her disdain of immodesty, the church in the shape of the abbot Frate Mauro Lapi asked her to ban her male courtiers from wearing long hair as this was seen as frivolous for men. She was known and popular for her charity. She survived the death of her spouse in 1471, as she is noted to have made her own will later that same year.   "
"Đurađ Crnojević (Serbian Cyrillic:  je, Church Slavonic:  ; d. 1514) was the last Serbian medieval Lord of Zeta between 1490 and 1496, from the Crnojevic dynasty. [SEP] The son of Ivan Crnojević and Goisava Arianiti, he was the founder of the first South Slavic printing house. Crnojević styled himself ""Duke of Zeta"". He was well known by his great education, knowledge of astronomy, geometry and other sciences. During his short-term reign he became famous for making efforts to spread the cultural heritage rather than for his political successes. The Ottomans made him leave Zeta in 1496. His brother Stefan inherited his position of the Lord of Zeta. In 1497 Venetians imprisoned Đurađ for some time, accusing him to be an Ottoman collaborator. He again spent some time in Venetian prison in period between 30 July and 25 October 1498. This time the Ottomans insisted that Venetians should put him into prison, which they eventually did. On 22 October 1499 he wrote his testament, which is considered as valuable literature work of its time.In the spring of 1500 Đurađ Crnojević came to Scutari, based on the invitation of Feriz Beg who instructed Crnojević to travel to Istanbul. In Istanbul Crnojević officially ceded his possessions to the sultan who granted him an estate (timar) in Anatolia to govern it as its sipahi.Although he was removed from the historical scene, his books remained as a great contribution to the Serbian culture. With the help of Hieromonk Makarije he printed five books of importance to the Montenegrin cultural heritage: Oktoih prvoglasnik (1493/94), Oktoih petoglasnik (1494), Psaltir s posljedovanjem (1495), Trebnik (prayer book; 1495/96), and Četvorojevanđelje (probably 1496).     His grandmother from his father's side was a sister of Skanderbeg. This made Đurađ Skanderbeg's grandnephew and through his mother he was the grandson of Gjergj Arianiti and nephew of Scanderbeg's wife Donika Kastrioti .   "
"Dolfin Dolfin or Delfino Delfin, was a Venetian nobleman who served during the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. [SEP]    Dolfin Dolfin, was born into the powerful Dolfin family of Venice, one of the oldest and most recognized noble families of the Serenissima. From a young age, he followed the ""cursus honorum"" of young Venetian noblemen, training in the army, the naval fleet, the law, and affairs of State. When the time came, Dolfin began to serve the Venetian navy, which had the most powerful fleet of its day. His family had a long tradition in the Navy, reaching special notoriety when Giovanni Dolfin broke the Hungarian siege of Treviso in order to be crowned as Doge in 1356. In the 15th century, Venice controlled most of the Mediterranean, and had important interests in the rump Byzantine Empire. Therefore, when the Ottomans began their siege of the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, the Venetian fleet was immediately involved in its defence. During the siege, Dolfin was commanded to defend the north gate of the city walls, which he managed with great success. When Giacomo Coco, admiral of the Christian fleet died while trying to burn the Turkish fleet, Dolfin was put in charge of it. Dolfin Dolfin survived the fall of the city.   "
"Pal Dukagjini or Paul Ducagin (Italian: Paolo Ducagini, 1411–1458) was an Albanian nobleman, a member of the Dukagjini family. [SEP] He and his kinsman Nicholas Dukagjini were initially subjects of Lekë Zaharia, a Venetian vassal who had possessions around Shkoder. Nicholas murdered Lekë, and the Dukagjini continued to rule over their villages under Venetian vassalage. Pal and Nicholas were part of the League of Lezhë, a military alliance that sought liberation of Albania from the Ottoman Empire, founded by the powerful Skanderbeg. In 1454, the Dukagjini accepted vassalage of Alfonso V of Aragon, as other chieftains had done three years earlier. Pal later abandoned Skanderbeg's army and deserted to the Ottomans.    He was one of the founding members of the League of Lezhë, a military alliance of some Christian members of the Albanian nobility forged in Lezhë on 2 March 1444 by: Lekë Zaharia (lord of Sati and Dagnum), and his vassals Pal and Nicholas Dukagjini Peter Spani (lord of the mountains behind Drivasto) Lekë Dushmani (lord of Pult) George Strez, John and Gojko Balšić (lords of Misia) Andrea Thopia with nis nephew Tanush George Araniti Theodor Corona Musachi Stefan Crnojević (lord of Upper Zeta) with his three sons Ivan, Andrija and BožidarPal Dukagjin and Nikola Dukagjin were vassals of Lekë Zaharia until Nikola Dukagjini killed him in 1444. Venice accepted their control over the properties they ruled when they were vassals of Lekë Zaharia (which included villages Buba, Salita, Gurichuchi, Baschina) because they agreed to be Venetian vassals after Zaharia's death.Alfonso V of Aragon first signed the Treaty of Gaeta with Skanderbeg in 1451 and then he signed similar treaties with Pal Dukagjini and other chieftains from Albania including: George Araniti, Ghin Musachi, George Strez Balšić, Peter Spani, Thopia Musachi, Peter of Himara, Simon Zenebishi and Carlo Toco.Pal was in Venice between November 1451 and February 1452, when the Venetian Senate accepted his request not to serve Venice in Ulcinj anymore but in Alessio because it was closer to his estates. The Senate ordered the lord of Ulcinj to pay for the previous services of Pal Dukagjin, and ordered the lord of Alessio to accept Pal's future services.On 21 October 1454, Alphonso V of Naples informed Skanderbeg that Pal Dukagjini had sent his envoys and declared his loyalty and vassalage to the Kingdom of Naples, which assigned 300 ducats of annual provisions to him.Together with many other Albanian noblemen (like Moisi Arianit Golemi, Nicholas Dukagjini and Hamza Kastrioti) he abandoned Skanderbeg's forces and deserted to the Ottomans. In 1457 Pope Callixtus III criticized the bishop of Krujë for the unjustified excommunication of Pal Dukagjini and his subjects.Pal Dukagjini left four sons: Nicholas Dukagjini, Lekë, Progon and Gjergj, of whom Nicholas and Lekë were politically notable.

"Maffeo Gherardi (1406–1492) (called the Cardinal of Venice) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal.

Gherardi later became abbot of this monastery, and later Abbot General of the Camaldolese Order.In April 1466, the Venetian Senate unanimously elected him to be the Patriarch of Venice.  Ambassadors of the Republic of Venice presented his selection to Pope Paul II on October 31, 1467, and the pope confirmed his appointment on December 16, 1468.  Gherardi subsequently held this position for the rest of his life. His chancellor for many years was Filippo da Rimini.Pope Innocent VIII made him a cardinal priest in pectore in the consistory of March 9, 1489.  On July 3, 1489, the pope declared that his creation would be published in the next consistory at which cardinals were created, and that if the pope died before such a consistory, he would nevertheless be eligible to participate in the next Papal Conclave.  Following the death of Pope Innocent VIII, Gherardi traveled to Rome, then in the midst of a sede vacante, arriving on August 3, 1492.  At the insistence of the Venetian Council of Ten, the College of Cardinals published his creation as a cardinal and allowed him to participate in the papal conclave of 1492, where he cast the decisive vote in favor of Pope Alexander VI. He received as Titular church the  deaconry of Santi Sergio e Bacco.On his way back to Venice, he died in Terni on September 14, 1492.  He is buried in San Pietro di Castello in Venice.   "
"Aliodea Morosini called ""Dea Moro"" (died 1478), was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Nicolò Tron (r. 1471-1473). She was described by the chronicler Palazzo as the greatest beauty of the century, and legend claims that her beauty was of importance for the election of her spouse as doge because of the great beauty cult in Venice at the time. [SEP] However, she was born to Silvestro Morosini and of an elder and more powerful family than her spouse, who was described as an upstart careerist. The coronation of her as a dogaressa was described as more magnificent than any previous in the history of Venice. She was described as a humble person. As a widow she retired to a convent and refused a state burial.   "
"Andrea Gritti (17 April 1455 – 28 December 1538) was the Doge of Venetian Republic from 1523 to 1538, following a distinguished diplomatic and military career. [SEP]      Andrea Gritti was born on 17 April 1455 in Bardolino, near Verona. His father, Francesco, son of Triadano Gritti, died soon after, and his mother, Vienna, daughter of Paolo Zane, remarried in 1460 to Giacomo Malipiero, with whom she had two more sons, Paolo and Michele. Andrea had a very close relationship with his half-brothers. Andrea was brought up by his paternal grandfather, receiving his first education at his grandfather's house in Venice, before going on to study at the University of Padua. At the same time he accompanied his grandfather on diplomatic missions to England, France, and Spain.    In 1476 he married Benedetta, daughter of Luca Vendramin, but she died at childbirth of their son, Francesco, on the same year. Widowed, Gritti moved to the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, where he engaged in trade, particularly of cereals, often in partnership with the Genoese merchant Pantaleo Coresi. He enjoyed the guidance of his great-uncle, Battista Gritti, who gave him insight on important officials and traders. Gritti's enterprise was successful and allowed him to live a prosperous life during his almost twenty-year stay in the city. At his home in the quarter of Galata, he lived with a Greek woman, with whom he had four illegitimate sons: Alvise, Giorgio, Lorenzo, Pietro. He also became a person of prominence in the Italian community of Galata, serving as head of the Venetian community. He also enjoyed a good relationship with the Ottoman grand vizier, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, securing from him various accommodations and exemptions in exchange for frequent monetary donations, as well as the esteem of Ahmed Pasha's father-in-law, Sultan Bayezid II.In 1492, the Venetian Bailo in Constantinople, Girolamo Marcello, was expelled on the charge of espionage. The post remained vacant, and Gritti assumed the task of representing Venice at the Ottoman court. Lacking an official appointment, however, his position was precarious, especially as, with another Ottoman–Venetian conflict looming in 1499, he used his commercial correspondence, sent via Corfu and the Ragusan merchant Nicolò Gondola, to transmit encoded information to the Venetian Senate regarding the movements of the Ottoman navy (referred to as ""carpets"" in one letter) and troop concentrations. This activity did not remain hidden from the Turks for long, however: after capturing couriers bearing Gritti's letters, in August 1499 he was imprisoned in the Yedikule Fortress, escaping execution only through his friendship with the grand vizier. According to contemporary reports, his imprisonment caused great consternation among his many friends—including Turks—at the Ottoman capital, as well as the many women enamoured in him.Gritti nevertheless spent 32 months in the fortress, along with other Venetian merchants, coming close to death due to the privations of this long imprisonment. He was released after a ransom of 2,400 ducats was paid, and returned to Venice. Gritti played a role in the negotiations and conclusion of the peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in December 1502, and then took active part in the reception of the Ottoman ambassador Ali Bey and the finalization of the treaty on 20 May 1503. Gritti's experience with the diplomatic customs of the Ottomans led to his being charged with overseeing the final formulation of the treaty's clauses, so as to remove any ambiguities and causes for misinterpretation. Finally, on 22 May, he left Venice with Ali Bey for Constantinople, bearing the draft treaty and a letter by the Doge to the Sultan. After the ratification of the treaty by the Sultan, he returned to Venice, making his report in the Senate on 2 December 1503.    The war and his long imprisonment put an end to Gritti's commercial career, costing him the enormous sum of 24,000 ducats. With little hope of recompense for his losses, he was forced in 1517 to ask the Senate's permission to accept a gift from the King of France as partial restitution of his losses. Rather than retiring, however, he now embarked on an active political career. He became a member of the—largely ineffective—committee tasked with recovering the losses suffered by the Venetian merchants in Constantinople, served as ducal councillor for the sestiere of Castello, and was member of the financial committee attached to the Council of Ten and of the Venetian delegation sent to Pope Julius II in October 1505, before becoming head of the Council of Ten.    In 1508, as the Republic's relations with the Holy Roman Empire broke down, leading to the outbreak of the War of the League of Cambrai, Gritti was appointed provveditore generale along with Giorgio Corner. The appointment signalled the beginning of a long military career, and was remarkable given his complete lack of military background. However, it was a sign of the Gritti's unique qualities: he was held in high regard by the Venetian patriciate, which among other things meant that he was able to ensure the flow of money to the army, while at the same time being able to ingratiate himself with the Republic's mercenary captains, and to ensure that the Republic's intentions were actually carried out by them. As provveditore generale, he toured the Venetian possessions on the Italian mainland, especially inspecting the fortifications of the Trentino. He then was elected a member of the Ten, and savio del consiglio, before being elected Procurator of St Mark's de supra on 12 April 1509.Gritti was soon appointed as provveditore generale to the Venetian field army, where he distinguished himself for his energy and capacity to endure hardship. With 1,500 men he reinforced the Venetian commander-in-chief, Niccolò di Pitigliano, in the Bresciano, and with 2,000 men he went to the aid of Cremona. He participated in the disastrous Venetian defeat at the Battle of Agnadello against the French on 14 May, but managed to escape to Brescia, carrying along a Banner of Saint Mark, that he later dedicated to the Santi Giovanni e Paolo church.The battle led to the collapse of Venetian rule in the Italian mainland—apart from Treviso, all Venetian conquests of the past century were undone, and French forces reached even the Venetian Lagoon. The news provoked panic and despair in Venice, which prepared for a siege. At the same time, it became clear that not all was lost: Agnadello had involved only part of the Venetian army, and the Venetians remained disposed to continue fighting. Gritti himself, through his undaunted conduct, became a symbol of that determination. He was immediately appointed as commander at Treviso, and soon gave proof of the Venetian resolve by recapturing Padua.Hostility to Venetian rule was widespread in Padua, among nobility and commoners alike, and Venice had abandoned it in early June. When Louis XII of France disbanded his army near Milan a month later, the Venetians decided to act: on 17–19 July, Gritti led his army in capturing Padua and its citadel, in an operation that encountered only slight resistance and resembled more a ""vast, tumultuous pageant more than a strictly military exercise"", but whose symbolic value was immense, and which made Gritti's political fortune, ultimately opening his way to the dogeship. Gritti instituted a harsh suppression of anti-Venetian elements in Padua, with arrests, executions, confiscations of property, and the exile of over 300 people to Venice. At the same time, however, he took care to impose strict discipline on his own troops, and prevent Venetian nobles from enriching themselves at the expense of the Paduans.At the same time, Gritti was quick to realize the importance of the burgeoning, spontaneous peasant resistance against the Imperial forces, which quickly widened into acts of guerrilla warfare. His own capture of Padua was assisted by armed peasants, and on 23 July he urged the Signoria of Venice to embrace this movement as part of a broader strategy to turn the tide of the war. As a result, the Venetian government promised the peasants suspension of all taxes and the cancellation of debts.In 1510, following the death of Niccolò di Pitigliano, Gritti took command of Venice's army, but was forced to withdraw to Venice by French advances.  He continued as proveditor through end of the conflict.  In 1512, he led the negotiations with Francis I of France that resulted in Venice leaving the League and allying with France.    Elected Doge in 1523, Gritti concluded a treaty with Charles V, ending Venice's active involvement in the Italian Wars.  He attempted to maintain the neutrality of the Republic in the face of the continued struggle between Charles and Francis, urging both to turn their attention to the advances of the Ottoman Empire in Hungary.  However, he could not prevent Suleiman I from attacking Corfu in 1537, drawing Venice into a new war with the Ottomans. His dogaressa was Benedetta Vendramin.Gritti acquired the Palazzo Pisani Gritti as his private residence in 1525.Gritti died on 28 December 1538.    A portrait of Andrea Gritti sometimes appears in the loading screen of the PC strategy game, Europa Universalis IV. The Venetian Republic is a popular playable nation in the game.a portrait of Andrea Gritti is also featured in the live action video game, MagiQuest. When you cast at the portrait, his eyes glow red.*   "

"Tanush Dukagjin (fl. 1423–33), known as Little Tanush, was an Albanian nobleman, a member of the Dukagjini family, the son of Pal Dukagjini (died 1393). He had four brothers: Progon (d. 1394), Pal II (d. 1402), Andrea (d. 1416), and Gjon Dukagjini (d. 1446). In January 1423, during the Second Scutari War, the Republic of Venice bribed and won over the Pamaliots on Bojana, and then bought over several tribal leader in or near Zeta: the Paštrovići, Gjon Kastrioti (who had extended to the outskirts of Alessio), the Dukagjins, and Koja Zaharija. [SEP] Though none of these were mobilized militarily by Venice, they left the ranks of Lazarević's army, thus became a potential danger to Lazarević. Although Venetian admiral Francesco Bembo offered money to Gjon Kastrioti, Dukagjins and to Koja Zaharija in April 1423 to join the Venetian forces against Serbian Despotate, they refused.Supported by the Ottomans, Stefan Maramonte plundered the region around Scutari and Ulcinj, and attacked Drivast in 1429, but failed to capture it. He was accompanied by Gojčin Crnojević and Little Tanush. In April 1429, Tanush received a gift of 120 perpers from the Republic of Ragusa.

"Alvise Loredan (1393 – 6 March 1466) was a Venetian nobleman of the Loredan family. [SEP] At a young age he became a galley captain, and served with distinction as a military commander, with a long record of battles against the Ottomans, from the naval expeditions to aid Thessalonica, to the Crusade of Varna, and the opening stages of the Ottoman–Venetian War of 1463–1479, as well as the Wars in Lombardy against the Duchy of Milan. He also served in a number of high government positions, as provincial governor, savio del consiglio, and Procuratore de Supra of Saint Mark's Basilica.    Alvise Loredan was born in 1393 in the parish of St. Canciano in Venice, the only son of Giovanni Loredan, son of the Procurator of St Mark's Alvise Loredan. The name and origin of his mother are unknown. At the age of 21 he married Andriola, daughter of the merchant Cristoforo Negrobon, who, although wealthy, was apparently not a member of the patriciate, the upper stratum of the Venetian aristocracy. This marriage involved Loredan in commercial activities, but without much success; the death of his father in 1420, while he was away as duke (governor) of Crete, forced Loredan to assume the leadership of his household, and by 1423 Alvise had entered the service of the Republic as sopracomito (captain) in one of the war galleys, although in September of that year he was allowed to lay aside that duty due to a grave illness.     In 1425 he appears again as sopracomito in the fleet under the command of Fantino Michiel, during the operations in defence of Thessalonica against the Ottoman Empire. In July 1425, Michiel led ten galleys east from the city: the Venetians raided Ierissos and other forts in its vicinity, and then onto Christopolis (modern Kavala). The Venetians found the castle held by a 400-strong force of Ottoman sipahis, under the command of a certain Ismail Bey. Loredan led the first attack, which was repulsed, and only after all the ships mustered their forces were the Venetians able to overcome Ottoman resistance in a four-hour long battle: 41 Turks were killed, including Ismail Bey, and 30 taken prisoner. The Venetians occupied the fortress, but their success was temporary, as the Turks soon returned with a larger force and stormed the castle, killing or taking prisoner its Venetian garrison.Loredan remained active in the area, for on 22 February 1429, an act of the Great Council of Venice named him as captain of a large cog, equipped with towers, that was to be sent to Thessalonica. Loredan and his ship was assigned a major role in the attack by the Captain general of the Sea Andrea Mocenigo against the Ottoman naval base at Gallipoli on 1 July: his great ship would approach the Ottoman fortifications and engage the garrison with crossbows at close range, while the rest of the fleet broke through the palisade protecting the harbour and attacked the Ottoman ships moored there. In the event, although Mocenigo with his flagship managed to break into the palisade, the other Venetian vessels did not follow, forcing Mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties.Loredan captained a ship in next year's fleet as well. The fleet left Venice on 5 March, but a few weeks later, while still under way, learned of the fall of Thessalonica to the Ottomans (29 March). Captain general Silvestro Morosini decided to avenge the city's fall by attacking an Ottoman fortress in the Dardanelles. The fort was largely destroyed after being bombarded by the fleet from 6 to 16 June; much of the work was done by Loredan's ship, which was specially equipped with large artillery pieces. Nevertheless, on 4 September, the Venetians concluded a peace treaty with the Ottomans.     In 1431, the third war against the Duchy of Milan, ruled by the ambitious Filippo Maria Visconti, began. On 19 May, Loredan was elected captain of the squadron sent to harass Genoese shipping in the waters of the Levant. In this capacity, Loredan executed a landing against the Genoese colony of Chios. On 27 January 1432, he was elected as a sopracomito in the Tyrrhenian Sea fleet, and thus came under the command of his uncle, the celebrated admiral Pietro Loredan. In 1433–34, he assumed his first civil post as podestà (governor) and captain of Belluno. In 1435, he was elected as captain of the muda (trade convoy) to ""Romania"" (the lands of the Byzantine Empire and the Black Sea).From December 1436 to September 1438 he was provveditore (commissioner, charged with both civil and military affairs) at Bergamo. His tenure coincided with the start of the fourth war against Milan, and the Visconti offensive under Niccolò Piccinino in Lombardy; in the event, however, Piccinino turned towards Brescia rather than Bergamo.At around this time his first wife, with whom he had two sons, Francesco and Giovanni, died, and in 1441, Lordan married Isabella Cocco di Nicolò, herself a widow from a first marriage to Benedetto Foscarini. She bore him another two sons, Marco and Nicolò. In the same year, Loredan became head of the sestiere of Dorsoduro, after moving his residence from his family's traditional parish of St. Canciano to the island of Giudecca.The Loredans were proponents of Venice's traditional, maritime orientation, and viewed with distrust its expansion on the Italian mainland (the Terraferma), which had brought it into conflict with Milan. Alvise Loredan shared this view, as can be seen from a proposal he brought before the Great Council in February 1442, ordering the governors of Bergamo to demolish its fortifications as a sign of goodwill and trust towards Visconti, following the conclusion of peace with Milan at the Treaty of Cremona. The proposal failed to pass; nevertheless he was voted as admiral of the Gulf for the year. Throughout the summer and autumn of 1442 he led operations against Aragonese corsairs in the waters off Albania and southern Italy, as well as subduing the towns of Zenta (now a suburb of Split) and Budva. On 3 February 1443, Loredan was elected as Procurator of St Mark's de Supra (in charge of the cathedral itself), but allowed to continue to reside in Giudeccain exchange for an annual rent of 70 ducats.     At the same time, he was elected as Captain general of the Sea, as part of the anti-Ottoman crusade being organized by King Ladislaus III of Poland and Hungary and John Hunyadi; however, the Venetians did not engage in any serious activity for the year, and on 11 November Loredan instead was appointed as one of the savii alle acque (officials charged with supervising the waterways of the Venetian Lagoon). On 25 April 1444, Loredan was appointed commander of the Venetian and Papal squadrons that would sail to take part in the crusade. His instructions, received on 17 June, were to obstruct the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, from crossing with his army into Anatolia and moving against the Karamanid ruler Ibrahim, who was allied with the Christian league. In the event, Loredan reached the Turkish Straits too late to stop Murad. As the Christian offensive in the Balkans was delayed, on 9 September he received instructions from Venice to abstain from offensive actions and open secret negotiations with the Sultan, who in the meantime defeated the Karamanids. Once the Crusader army began its invasion, however, he was charged with hindering the Ottoman army from returning to Europe. Loredan blockaded the Dardanelles, but Murad chose to cross the Bosporus north of Constantinople. As a result, on 11 November, at the Battle of Varna, the Ottomans inflicted a crushing defeat on the Crusader army. While Venice negotiated for a peace with the Sultan, Loredan spent the next year cruising with his fleet in the Aegean, in order to protect Venice's possessions and allies from Ottoman reprisals.    In late 1445, Loredan returned to Venice to disband his fleet. In October 1446, he became a savio del consiglio, and on 28 November he became a member of the zonta (extraordinary judicial committee) of the Council of Ten on the issue of Jacopo Foscari, the son of Doge Francesco Foscari: he was allowed to return from exile to Nauplia in Greece to Zelarino, in close proximity to Venice. On 23 February 1447 he was elected provveditore in campo (commissioner to the captain general of the army) for the new war against Milan, but declined to take p the post on account of ill health. On 17 March, he went to Rome as part of an embassy to congratulate the new Pope, Nicholas V. After his return, he was again elected provveditore in campo on 25 August, in order to assist his colleague Gherardo Dandolo. He accepted, but his poor health continued, and on 14 November he returned to Venice. Following the Milanese victory at the Battle of Caravaggio, on 8 November 1448 he was elected ambassador, along with Pasquale Malipiero, to the Milanese commander, Francesco Sforza, with whom Venice made a pact: in exchange for promising him rule over Milan, Sforza allied himself with Venice. After a brief period as provveditore in campo of Brescia, Loredan returned to Venice, where on 6 February 1449 he became a member of a zonta convened to try some Paduan rebels. In July, after he was once more elected as Captain general of the Sea in the war launched by Alfonso V of Aragon, who as King of Naples claimed the Ionian Islands, a Venetian dominion. Loredan led a fleet of 35 galleys to raid Messina and the coasts of Sicily, and scored a major success when he forced entry into the harbour of Syracuse, and destroyed the ships he found there. He returned to Venice in November 1449, when he was elected as one of the commissioners of salt (provveditori al Sale). The conflict ended on 2 July 1450 by a compromise peace.Loredan reappears in August 1453, as provveditore of the Venetian Arsenal; following the Fall of Constantinople, he and his colleague Vettore Cappello were charged with constructing new war galleys. In October he was again elected savio del consiglio until March 1454, and again in October 1454 until March 1455. In this capacity he was sent to Bartolomeo Colleoni to offer him the post of captain general of the Venetian armies, but with a reduced salary (condotta) on account of the prevailing peaceful conditions. During the following years, he was almost continuously among the savi del consiglio. In April 1457 he received permission to leave the city for four months on account of the plague. In October 1458, he argued against the Pope's proposal to hold a general meeting of Christian princes at Udine for the purpose of preparing another anti-Ottoman crusade. In December 1460 he was charged with investigating the sentences passed by the Auditori alle Sentenze. In January 1461 he was again one of the salt commissioners.     On 4 February 1463, while serving again as a savio del consiglio, Loredan was elected as Captain general of the Sea in the conflict with the Ottomans in the Morea. As the Venetians hoped to contain the conflict, his initial orders were marked by caution: he was to patrol the Aegean and defend any Venetian territories, but limit offensive actions to at most capturing Genoese ships. Following the Ottoman capture of Argos on 3 April, however, the situation changed, and Venice declared war on the Ottomans. Between June and August, Loredan landed an army under the Marquis Bertoldo d'Este off Modon and Nauplia. The campaign initially made rapid gains: Argos was recaptured in early August, and the Venetians refortified the Isthmus of Corinth, restoring the Hexamilion wall and equipping it with many cannons. They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the Acrocorinth, which controlled the northwestern Morea. The Venetians engaged in repeated clashes with the defenders and with the relief army under Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey, until they suffered a major defeat on 20 October, which resulted in the wounding and subsequent death of d'Este. The Venetians were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion. Following the arrival of substantial Ottoman reinforcements under the Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha Angelović the Venetians, whose army had been depleted by dysentery, abandoned the Hexamilion without a fight and retreated to their coastal fortresses. The Ottomans razed the wall yet again and advanced into the Morea. Argos surrendered and was razed, and several forts and localities that had recognized Venetian authority reverted to their Ottoman allegiance.After the Venetian retreat, Loredan attempted to gain an advantage for Venice by capturing Lemnos, and then brought the fleet of anchor at the colony of Negroponte. Loredan requested to be repatriated, whereupon the Senate elected Orsotto Giustinian as his successor. The transfer of authority took place at Modon on 28 February 1464, and Loredan returned home. On 5 September he was elected as envoy to congratulate the new Pope, Paul II (a Venetian), but he refused to accept; the government allowed him to postpone the embassy until the next spring, but in the end, they chose another to replace him.On 4 September 1465 he was again, for the fourth time, elected as Captain general of the Sea, in the ongoing war with the Ottomans. Despite his poor health he accepted, but soon his situation deteriorated to such an extent that on 7 February 1466 Vettore Cappello was elected to replace him. Loredan died in Venice on 6 March, and was buried in the Church of Santa Maria dei Servi, Venice.   "
"Pietro Loredan (1372 – 28 October 1438) was a Venetian nobleman and distinguished military commander both on sea and on land. [SEP] He fought against the Ottomans, winning the Battle of Gallipoli (1416), played a leading role in the conquest of Dalmatia in 1411–1420, and participated in several campaigns against Venice's Italian rivals, Genoa and Milan, to secure Venice's mainland domains (Terraferma). He also held a number of senior political positions as Avogador de Comùn, ducal councillor, and governor of Zara, Friuli, and Brescia, and was honoured with the position of Procurator of St Mark's in 1425. In 1423, he contended for the position of Doge of Venice, but lost to his bitter rival Francesco Foscari; their rivalry was such that when Loredan died, Foscari was suspected of having poisoned him.    Pietro Loredan was born in 1372, in the parish of St. Canciano in Venice. He was a scion of a veritable dynasty of admirals: his father Alvise Loredan and grandfather, and later his son and nephew, were all distinguished naval commanders in the service of the Republic of Venice. His father was further distinguished by being elected to the highly prestigious position of Procurator of St Mark's. His mother, Joan, appears to have been from a wealthy family. Pietro Loredan married at a young age, probably in 1395, to Campagnola Vitale Lando di Pietro. Some historians report a second marriage, to a Foscolo, in 1422, but as Campagnola survived her husband and is still mentioned in his will, this is evidently erroneous.Loredan first appears in 1403, serving as commander of one of the three galleys that conveyed the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391–1425– ) back to Constantinople, after his voyage in the courts of Western Europe. On the return journey, the three ships joined with the Venetian fleet under Carlo Zeno, and participated in the Venetian victory against the Genoese fleet of Marshal Boucicaut at the Battle of Modon on 7 October 1403.    Loredan probably continued to serve in the fleet thereafter, until 1411, when he is attested for the first time as fleet commander (Captain of the Gulf), at the signing of the Treaty of Selymbria between Venice and the Ottoman prince and contender for the Ottoman throne, Musa Çelebi, on 3 September. He was then ordered to go to Zara in Dalmatia, where a conflict for control of the region had broken out with the King of Hungary (and Holy Roman Emperor-elect) Sigismund. As captain-general he obtained the capitulation of Sebenico on 21 July 1412, and hastened to the assistance of the Venetian land forces at Motta di Livenza, helping them score a decisive victory against Sigismund's troops on 24 August. At this point Loredan came into conflict with his lifelong rival, Francesco Foscari; unlike Foscari, who advocated expansion in the Italian mainland (the Terraferma), Loredan was a proponent of Venice's maritime orientation.In October 1412, Loredan was named ducal councillor, but held the post only briefly, as he was elected governor (podesta) of Treviso. The city constituted the ""pivot of the Venetian defence system in the east"", and Loredan busied himself with strengthening its fortifications over the next year. On 26 June 1414 he was elected, along with Lorenzo Capello and Vitale Miani, as provveditore over Dalmatia. There he was active in the suppression of pro-Hungarian moves among the local nobility, and in the preparations for a new fortification of Zara. on 5 April 1415 he was appointed commander of the annual trade convoy (muda) to Flanders. On his return he was elected as an Avogador de Comùn (public prosecutor), but again held the post for a short while because on 2 April 1416 he was chosen as captain of the Gulf to lead an expedition to the Ottoman Empire. The Great Council of Venice charged him with conveying Venetian ambassadors to the Sultan, and exhausting peaceful means, but in the event, on 29 May 1416, at the Battle of Gallipoli, Loredan scored a major victory against the Ottoman fleet, destroying or capturing most of its vessels. Loredan himself was wounded in the battle. Despite this success, the conflict was not concluded until November 1419, when a peace treaty was signed following exhaustive negotiations. Nevertheless, on his return to Venice on 8 November 1416, Loredan was feted as a hero.In spring 1417 he was sent as an envoy to Milan to complain about the occupation of Lodi, Como, and other places whose autonomy had been guaranteed by Venice. Then he was appointed rector at Zara, where he remained until late 1418. Upon completion of his term there, he was again selected as Avogador de Comùn. In September 1419, he was elected as one of the committee of five wise men (Savi di Terraferma) charged with overseeing the final phase of the Venetian conquest of Dalmatia and Friuli. As Sigismund was preoccupied with dealing with the Hussite Rebellion, the Venetians moved in to secure their claims on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. Loredan was again named captain of the Gulf on 8 February 1420, and set sail from Venice on 12 May. By the end of June, he had secured the surrender of Trogir and Split, and between September and October he brought the islands of Brač, Korčula, and Hvar under Venetian control. In February 1421 he was sent to the Levant to counter the Genoese Giovanni Ambrogio Spinola, who was raiding Venetian commercial shipping in the area. On is return in summer, he was sent to Friuli as its luogotenente (""Lieutenant"", i.e., governor). His selection for the post was probably influenced by the fact that the area had been conquered by his nephew, Francesco Loredan, the previous year.In 1422 he served again as captain of the muda of Flanders, and was appointed again as ducal councillor. On 3 November he was present at the registration of his son, Francesco, in the Balla d'Oro, the book containing the names of the nobles eligible for public office.    On 4 April 1423, the Doge Tommaso Mocenigo died at a critical juncture: the next Doge would have to make decisions affecting the course of the Republic, particularly regarding the continued expansion in the Terraferma or a reaffirmation of the traditional maritime policy. A successful commander, well educated and a capable orator, Loredan had all the prerequisites necessary for the position, but in the end it was his old rival, Francesco Foscari, who was elected. The two men were fierce rivals, their political differences reinforced by personal relationships. Thus two of Loredan's daughters, Maria and Marina, were married to Francesco Barbaro and Ermolao Donà respectively, both of them opponents of Foscari. Furthermore, when Foscari proposed a marriage between his own daughter and one of Loredan's sons, it was rejected.     Despite this setback, on 12 January 1424 Loredan was again elected as captain-general of the Gulf, with the task of assisting Thessalonica, which the Republic had acquired the previous year, by attacking Gallipoli and applying military and diplomatic pressure on the Ottoman Sultan Murad II to recognize Venetian possession of the city. Loredan led his fleet to patrol the Dardanelles from July to October, and fought a number of engagements with the Turks. This prompted the Byzantine emperor to send Loredan a number of holy relics as a token of gratitude. Despite Loredan's activities, however, the conflict continued fruitlessly for the Venetians, amidst increasing suffering and discontent for the inhabitants of Thessalonica, until the city was conquered by the Ottomans in March 1430.In 1425 he was savio del consiglio, until he was elected as Procurator of St Mark's on 17 June. At this time, Venice decided to join the war between the ruler of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, and the Republic of Florence, as Visconti's successes were threatening the balance of power in Italy. In 1426, Loredan was appointed as provveditore of the army along with Fantino Michiel, and accompanied the condottiere Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola in the conquest of Brescia (9–10 August 1426). Loredan remained in the city as rector over the next year. In summer 1427 he repelled a Milanese attack on Brescia, and was one of the driving forces in getting Carmagnola to abandon his dilatory stance and confront the Milanese, leading to the victory of the Battle of Maclodio on 11 October.Loredan disappears from the sources for the next few years until 1431, when the war between Venice and Milan was renewed. On 28 May he was appointed as captain-general of the Sea and charged with sailing into the Tyrrhenian Sea, joining with the Florentines, and capturing Genoa, which had joined Visconti. The Venetian fleet gained a major victory over the Genoese at Rapallo on 21 August, but the Venetians failed in their efforts to overthrow the Genoese government. Loredan then led his fleet to winter in Apulia and Corfu. Returning to the Tyrrhenian Sea, he stormed the fortress of Sestri in July, where he was wounded; unable to contribute anything more to the campaign, he returned with his fleet to Venice, where they arrived on 22 October.Over the next few years, Loredan served alternately as savio del consiglio and ducal councillor for the sestiere of San Marco. When the conflict with Milan broke out again in 1437, Loredan was once again appointed provveditore of the army on 9 April, under the commander-in-chief Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua, but poor health forced him to leave his post and return to Venice, being replaced by Paolo Tron. The war began badly for the Venetians, however, and as soon as Loredan was restored to health in November, he was sent to join the army and raise its faltering morale. He was joined by his son Giacomo Loredan, who thus began his own distinguished military career. By that time, it became clear that Gonzaga was considering defecting from Venice to the Milanese. On 21 June 1438 Loredan was elected as ambassador to the Marquess, in a last-ditch effort to prevent his defection, but Loredan refused. On 13 July, he was appointed commander of the naval forces on the Po River. His appearance alone was sufficient to quell a riot by the troops in the Piazza San Marco. Nevertheless, the campaign went badly: Loredan was unable to exercise his accustomed tactics in a river, his actions were dependent on the course of the land campaign, and the climate once again affected his health.On 23 August 1438, Loredan dictated his last will, and on 21 October obtained permission to return to Venice, being replaced by Stefano Contarini. He arrived in Venice on October 26 ""molto agravato da mal"" and died two days later. He was buried in the Monastery of St. Helena (demolished in the Napoleonic period). His tomb's inscription claimed that he was poisoned by unknown enemies(""per insidias hostium veneno sublatus""); popular legend ascribed the deed to the Doge Francesco Foscari. Loredan left behind a series of Commentaries, well-regarded by the contemporary historian (and Loredan's subordinate at Brescia) Flavio Biondo, but now lost.   "
"Marina Nani (circa 1400–1473) was a Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Francesco Foscari (r. 1423–1457). She was the daughter of Bartolommeo Nani and married Francesco Foscari in 1415. [SEP] Her spouse was elected Doge in 1423. She would have been born in about 1400 and was one of the youngest dogaressas ever, as well as one of the few to give birth in office. She was crowned in an elabourate ceremony in 1427, when a crown was placed upon her head, and made a formal entry into the city. She was escorted during the ceremony by the marquis of Mantua and the marquis of Ferrara. Marina Nani played an active role during her husband's office, and few of the preceding or succeeding dogaressas participated so much in official representation and had such a visible public role as she. She is noted to have acted as an envoy to visiting female dignitaries or wives of visiting male dignitaries, showing them around Venice and thereby demonstrating its wealth and position and working as a diplomat forging alliances.In 1445, her son was accused of high treason and bribery, and her spouse was forced to have him exiled. Marina pleaded for him without success. This caused Francesco a depression, which made Pietro Loredani accuse him of being unsuitable for his office. Marina pleaded with Loredani, but he answered by accusing her of high treason and adultery. Francesco was deposed in 1457 and died shortly after. The authorities wished to give him a state funeral because he was popular and the public was not aware of how he had been deposed. Marina refused to give them his body. Eventually, she was forced to do so, but she refused to participate in the funeral. Maria Nani had a long widowhood and lived a peaceful life on substantial land she had inherited.   "
"Benedetto Pesaro (c. 1430 – August 1503) was a Venetian nobleman who served as commander-in-chief of the Venetian navy from 1500 to 1503. [SEP] He is notable for his military successes during the Second Ottoman–Venetian War. He was elected to the post on 28 July 1500, shortly after the death of his predecessor Melchior Trevisan. A scion of the noble Pesaro family, he was about 70 at the time of his election, returning an approximate birthdate of 1430. Supposedly possessed of a voracious sexual appetite, the diarist Girolamo Priuli took unkindly to the fact that he still enjoyed the company of mistresses in old age.His first victory came in late 1500 when, aided by a Spanish fleet under Gonzalo de Cordoba, he retook Cephalonia from the Ottomans. Later, in 1502, he met his cousin Jacopo Pesaro (who had thirteen papal galleys under his command) on the Greek island of Cerigo, and from there launched an assault on Turkish-controlled Santa Maura; the island fell on 30 August. However, when peace was agreed the next year, concessions were made; while Cephalonia was kept under Venetian control, Santa Maura was returned to the Turks.Also worthy of note is Pesaro's ruthlessness in the field. In 1501, after capturing the notorious Turkish pirate Erichi, whose ship had run aground on Milos, he had him roasted to death. On another occasion, Pesaro ordered the beheading of Marco Loredan, a relative of Doge Leonardo Loredan, for his unseemly readiness to surrender his fort to the Turks.He died in August 1503 at Corfu, having fallen ill as he was making preparations to return home. In his will he requested that he be interred in the Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. His funerary monument, which stands there today, was constructed by the brothers Lorenzo and Giambattista Bregno.

"Domenico Pisani was a Venetian nobleman and briefly the lord of the Aegean island of Santorini in 1479–1480. [SEP] He was the son of Giovanni Pisani, the Venetian Duke of Candia, and was chosen by the Duke of Naxos, Giacomo III Crispo, as the husband of his daughter Fiorenza. Giacomo III awarded Pisani the fief of Santorini as his daughter's dowry, on condition that no son was born to Giacomo III, whereupon the island would revert to the ducal domain. The festivities for the wedding at Milos and on Santorini itself were extravagant and lasted for an entire month. Pisani busied himself with restoring the island's agriculture and commerce, and placed his domain under the protection of his motherland, Venice; the Venetian Senate confirmed his possession of the island on 22 June 1480.His good fortune was not to last, however, as Giacomo III died in the same year. As the duke had died without a son, this should have secured Pisani's possession of Santorini, but the new duke, Giacomo's brother Giovanni III Crispo—due to Salic Law, Pisani's wife could not inherit the duchy—landed on Santorini and occupied the island. Pisani and his wife turned to Venice for aid, but Giovanni III and his soldiers managed to repel a Venetian fleet attacking Skaros, the chief fortress of Santorini. In the end, after a complicated legal battle, the Venetian Senate resolved on 4 October 1486 that Santorini was to remain with Crispo, after paying compensation to the Pisani.   "

"Stefan Balšić (Serbian Cyrillic:  ; fl. 1419-40), known as Stefan Maramonte, was a Zetan nobleman. [SEP] He was the son of Konstantin Balšić and Helena Thopia. After Konstantin's death (1402), Helena entered the Republic of Venice and then lived with her sister Maria. Since Maria was married to Phillip Maramonte, the Venetians and Ragusans often referred to Stefan Balšić with the name Maramonte. He was initially a close associate to Zetan lord Balša III (r. 1403-1421), being his vassal. Balša III and Stefan fought against the Republic of Venice, and Stefan helped in the administration of the land as co-ruler with Balša III, he did however not succeed Balša III. Balša III, who died on 28 April 1421, had decided to pass the rule of Zeta to his uncle, the Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarević. When the Second Scutari War between Venice and Despot Stefan began, he [...]. Stefan left Apulia in the summer of 1426, seeking to take Zeta. During the 1427–28 conflict, Maramonte went to the Ottoman court where he sought the support of Sultan Murad II for his appointment as the Lord of Zeta. There, he met Skanderbeg, who was a hostage at the Ottoman court. Maramonte married Vlajka Kastrioti, the sister of Skanderbeg. Supported by the Ottomans, Maramonte, accompanied by Gojčin Crnojević and Little Tanush,  plundered the region around Scutari and Ulcinj, and attacked Drivast in 1429, but failed to capture it. Since his attempts failed, Maramonte surrendered to the Venetians and served as their military officer in the campaigns in Flanders and Lombardia.       His name was Stefan Balšić (Latin: Stephanus de Balsis), but he was called Stefan Maramonte (sr. Stefan Crnogorac, de. Stephan Czernogoraz), meaning ""Stefan from the Black Mountain (Montenegro)"" (Latin: Stephanus de Maramonte Zarnagorae).   "
"Tommaso Tommasini (died in early 1463), better known as Thomas of Hvar (Serbo-Croatian: Toma Hvarski/ ), was Bishop of Lesina (Hvar) from 23 December 1429 until his death, as well as permanent papal legate to the Kingdom of Bosnia from 1439 until 1461.Thomas [SEP] was Venetian by birth, but he ""must have known Slavic"" both through his episcopate on the Croat-inhabited island and through his long contact with Bosnians. He significantly influenced the relations between the Holy See and Bosnia, as well as papal views on the indigenous Bosnian Church, but little is known about his personality, politics, activity in the kingdom or relations with Bosnian Franciscans. John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr. argues that Thomas deliberately misinformed the Papacy about the Bosnian Church, fabricating claims of dualism.Bishop Thomas of Hvar probably approached his namesake, King Thomas of Bosnia, in 1443, when Pope Eugene IV hoped to draw Bosnia into the Crusade of Varna. He probably discussed the Catholic Church's issue with heresy in Bosnia at that time. In 1446, he converted the King himself from Bosnian Christianity to Roman Catholicism.   "
"Gabriele Trevisano was a Venetian commander, who participated on the losing side of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, having joined the Byzantine Empire in its defence of its capital city against the Ottoman Empire.

On 28 April a battle broke out between Venetian and Genoese vessels on one side and Turkish ships on the other. Trevisano's galley was sunk by Turkish cannon-fire, and abandoned. At other times the Venetians and their allies won some minor naval skirmishes against the Turks. During the siege, Trevisano also commanded a Byzantine garrison at the Maiden's Tower. Towards the end, Trevisano was captured by the Sultan's forces before he and his men could escape from the walls.   "

He learned oil painting from Antonello da Messina, and is said to have produced, in 1473, the first oil picture done in Venice. Housed in the basilica of San Zanipolo, it is a large altar-piece in nine divisions, representing Augustine and other saints.Most of his works, however, are in tempera. His outline is always hard, and his colour good; the figures have much dignified and devout expression.

"Anna Notaras Palaiologina (Greek:   ; died 8 July 1507) was the daughter of Loukas Notaras, the last megas doux of the Byzantine Empire. [SEP]     Anna probably left Constantinople prior to fall of Constantinople in 1453, although the passenger manifest of a Genoese ship which escaped the siege on the morning of the 29th May includes two entries for the family name Notaras. Her exact whereabouts before 1459 are not certain, but in that year she appeared in Italy and made claim to the Notaras family inheritance, held at the Bank of Saint George in Genoa. The fate of this large inheritance had become a diplomatic question during the six years following the death of Loukas Notaras. She had her younger brother, Jacob Notaras, disinherited on the grounds that he had converted to Islam while in captivity. She lived for a time in Rome before eventually settling in Venice, where she became the center of the Byzantine expatriate community.She repeatedly petitioned the Republic to allow the construction of an Orthodox church within Venice (something not granted until 1539) and when the Council of Ten prevaricated, she badgered them into a compromise, allowing her to build an oratory within her own sizable Casa and hold Orthodox services within it from 1475. In 1498, the Venetian Senate finally granted their Greek community the right to found the Scuola di San Nicolò dei Greci, a confraternity which aided members of that community. Although Anna Notaras died in 1507, prior to the completion of San Giorgio dei Greci, she left three icons in her will to the church, where they remain today.  In 1499, the first exclusively Greek printing press in Venice began operation under the direction of Nikolaos Vlasto and Zacharias Kalliergis. The first product of the press was the Etymologicum Magnum and the dedication at the front thanks the ‘most modest lady Anna, daughter of…Loukas Notaras’ who had defrayed its cost.In 1472 Anna began negotiations with the council of Siena to take possession of the old castle of Montauto and the surrounding lands in order to found a commune where Greeks could live ""according to their laws and customs"". In their correspondence with her, the council referred to her as the widow of the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos (r. 1449–1453), but this was untrue. There is no mention of such a marriage in any other contemporary source, especially in the writings of George Sphrantzes, his chancellor. Although the legal contract was drawn up, the commune project went no further.A friend of Cardinal Bessarion, Anna also recovered several Greek manuscripts from the east. In 1470 she acquired a 12th century manuscript Catena of Job written for the Grand Duke of Cyprus. On March 2, 1489, Zabeta, widow of her brother Jacob, filed a petition before the judges of the Venetian Procurator alleging that Jacob had shortly before his death in Ancona, sent to his sister Anna ""a box of law books of different kinds, both on parchment and on paper"" of great value. She demanded that Anna hand over these works to her, or be ordered to pay her the sum of 120 ducats. Anna acknowledged receipt of this box but contended that most of the books had actually been bought by herself and been lent to Jacob. Anna won this court case and on 8 May 1490, Anna filed a petition against Zabeta, alleging that she had entered the Ca Notaras and stolen a valuable copy of Petrarch, which Anna had bought from Thomas Palaiologos in 1462, during his visit to Venice, which she valued at 51 ducats. The judge ruled in Anna's favour again.    Anna Notaras appears as a central character in The Dark Angel by Mika Waltari and Porphyry and Ash by Peter Sandham.   "

A figure of the Doge was originally shown kneeling before the lion of Venice on the top storey below the bell but this was removed by the French in 1797 after Venice had surrendered to Napoleon.In 1496 he created an Italian coalition to push back Charles VIII of France from Italy, which led to the Battle of Fornovo during the French retreat from Italy. During his reign Venice gained several strongholds in Romagna and annexed the island of Cyprus. His relationships with the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II were initially amicable, but they became increasingly strained starting from 1492, eventually leading to open war in 1499. The Venetian merchants in Istanbul were arrested, while Bosnian troops invaded Dalmatia and reached Zara. The Venetian fleet was defeated at the Battle of Zonchio, and the Republic lost its base in Lepanto. The latter was soon followed by Modone and Corone, which meant the loss of all the main intermediate stops for the Venetian ships sailing towards the Levante. After four years of war, a peace treaty was signed in 1503. By it, Venice maintained in Morea only Nafplion, Patras and Monemvasia. His dogaressa was Elisabetta Soranzo. Agostino's brother was Marco Barbarigo, who had preceded him as Doge but survived in office for less than a year; their tomb, originally in the church of the Carita, has been demolished.

"Cristoforo Moro (1390 – November 10, 1471) was the 67th Doge of Venice. [SEP] He reigned from 1462 to 1471.    The Moro family settled in Venice in the mid-12th century when Stephanus Maurus, a great-grandson of Maurus, built a church on the island of Murano. Cristoforo was the eleventh person from the family to be elected doge. His dogaressa was Cristina Sanudo.    After graduating from university, Moro held various public offices. He was the Venetian ambassador to the Popes Eugene IV and Nicholas V. Saint Bernardino of Siena was said to have prophesied that Moro would one day become doge, and as the fulfillment of a solemn vow Moro had the Church of Saint Giobbe built and dedicated to Bernardino's memory. He bequeathed his fortune to various charitable organizations and foundations, including the Church of Saint Giobbe.    Moro's reign was marked by the beginning of a long war between Venice and the Turks. In 1463 Pope Pius II sent Moro a consecrated sword with the intention of convincing Venice to join the anti-Turk alliance. The reaction in Venice was initially hesitant as the Republic's main priority was their economic interests. In April 1463, 10 years after the conquest of Constantinople, Turkish troops occupied the Venetian fortress of Argos in Greece. The Latin Patriarch Cardinal Johannes Bessarion traveled to Venice to call on the Republic to join the ""defense of the faith""; i.e. join the war against the Turks. That same year a coalition was formed between Venice, Hungary and the Albanian prince Skanderbeg with the blessing of the Pope to counter the threat of Sultan Mehmed II's aggressive policy of conquest. The coalition succeeded in temporarily halting Turkish expansion; however, the new territorial limits acquired by the Turks in their conquests had by and large been accepted. In 1469 the Venetian fleet commander Niccolò Canal retook the town of Ainos in Thrace, but he was not able to defend the island of Negroponte (Euboea), a major granary of Venice, from Turkish attack. Euboea was conquered by the Sultan while inflicting enormous losses on the Venetian forces. The Republic faced further threats from the northern Italian cities who coveted Venetian land, as well as from the French king Louis XI who was seeking to expand Lombardy at the expense of Venice.

He was consigliere for naval matters and ambassador of Venice to Pope Pius II.  Tron was married to Aliodea Morosini, known sometime as Dea Tron or Dea Moro.    In the doge election of 1471 Tron prevailed against his later successors Pietro Mocenigo and Andrea Vendramin.  During his reign Venice consolidated its control of Cyprus and reduced its frequent quarrels with the Turks by forming an alliance with the Persian Ussan Hassan Beg.  His skillful politics enabled Venice to enjoy a period of freedom during his reign.  However, his policy of building up the military sharply increased Venice's public debt. Tron reformed the monetary system of Venice.  He introduced a new coin, called the Lira, which on the reverse side depicted the profile of the doge like the ancient coins used to; and thus went against the Venetian practice of rejecting any association of a personality cult with the Republic of Venice.  After his death the coin was changed to feature a kneeling, unidentifiable Doge.     Tron's tomb was commissioned by his son Filippo Tron and built in the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.  The tomb's design and construction is attributed to the architect of the Doge's Palace, Antonio Rizzo.

He had served as Venetian Procurator in Rome, and his brief reign was largely concerned with the end of the Second Turkish–Venetian War.  He probably died of plague. The process of his election as Doge resulted in a divisive split in the Council, that resulted in bad feelings: in 1477 Antonio Feleto was imprisoned, then banished, for remarking in public that the Council of the Forty-One must have been hard-pressed to elect a cheesemonger Doge. The diarist Malipiero noted that Andrea Vendramin at the time of his election was worth 160,000 ducats, after allowing for 6 to 7000 ducats with which he had endowed each of six daughters, in order to procure politically influential sons-in-law. In his youth, he and his brother Luca, in joint ventures, used to ship from Alexandria enough goods to fill a galley or a galley and a half, Malipiero recorded in retrospect: even his factors grew rich managing his affairs.He has a large monumental wall-tomb, generally agreed to be ""the most lavish funerary monument of Renaissance Venice"", in the basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, the usual burial-place of Doges, which was executed by Tullio Lombardo (1493), though Andrea del Verrocchio competed for the commission. It was originally intended for the church of Santa Maria dei Servi.  However the portrait in the Frick Collection by Gentile Bellini, inscribed with his name, is now considered to be of his successor, Doge Giovanni Mocenigo. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges. After Andrea's death, his widow married his brother, Luca.

"Filippo Morandi (c. 1409 – 1497), usually known as Filippo da Rimini, was a humanist, teacher, writer and administrator in the Republic of Venice. [SEP] Filippo was born at Rimini probably between 1408 and 1410, since Bernardo Bembo noted that he was almost ninety years old at his death. His father, Federighino, belonged to a prominent local family. Apostolo Zeno believed that he came from a Riminese family living in Treviso, but this is contradicted by Filippo's own writings.Filippo went abroad for his education. He taught at Padua, Rome and Bologna, finally settling in Venice in 1435. In 1441, he delivered a speech in praise of Doge Francesco Foscari before the ducal court and Francesco Sforza. He became a Venetian citizen on 7 December 1443, by which time his father was dead. He made his residence in Venice for the rest of his life. In 1446, he was the first teacher appointed at Venice's first public school, the chancery school of San Marco. He held that position until 1450. Between 1450 and 1463, he was the chancellor of the Venetian island of Corfu. He wrote a valuable report on the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. In 1463, he took up teaching at San Marco again. In 1466, he left for a second time to serve as chancellor to Maffeo Gherardi, Patriarch of Venice. He remained with the patriarch for many years and died at Venice in 1497.Filippo was patronized by Francesco Barbaro and possibly Bernard Bembo. He delivered an oration at the funeral of Barbaro in 1454. He maintained a correspondence with Barbaro, Andrea Contrario, Vinciguerra Dandolo, Pietro Dolfin, Andrea Donato, Ermolao Donato, Roberto Malatesta, the monks of San Michele di Murano and Cardinal Ludovico Trevisan. He wrote political and spiritual poetry in Latin. His most important other writings are:  Epithalamium, dedicated to Caterina Caldiera Excidium Constantinopolitanae urbis quae quondam Bizantium ferebatur, his account of the fall of Constantinople, dedicated to Barbaro. This account is one of the earliest to portray the Turks as descendants of the Teucri (Trojans) seeking revenge for the Trojan War. He relates the story that Sultan Mehmed II raped a virgin at the altar of the Hagia Sophia in revenge for the rape of Cassandra. Invectiva in vanissimos homines, a manuscript of which was owned by Pietro Barozzi Symposium de paupertateHis last known work was a collection of 42 Latin epigrams on the glory of Venice, dedicated to Bembo and composed when he was eighty years old.

"Niccolò Sagundino (1402 – March 1464) was a Greek-born Venetian secretary, diplomat and humanist. [SEP] He wrote numerous letters, as well as religious and philosophical treatises, mostly in Latin. Originally from Euboea, he was in Venetian service when he was wounded and captured by the Ottomans at the fall of Thessaloniki in 1430. He favoured the union between the Catholic and Orthodox churches and worked for the Papacy. He undertook several Venetian missions to the Ottoman court and to Greek lands, on one of which he suffered a shipwreck that killed several of his immediate family. He died in Venice.    Sagundino was born in 1402 to a Greek family in Chalkis, the capital of the Venetian kingdom of Negroponte. His father's name was Manuel. His mother's name is unknown. His family was originally from Constantinople and had two branches, one at Chalkis and another at Thessaloniki. They were citizens of Venice.Sagundino received a classical education. He was in the employ of the Venetian state at Thessaloniki when the Ottomans captured the city in 1430. He was wounded in the assault and taken prisoner with his family. After his release, he served Venice as advocatus curiae in Chalkis from 1434 until 1437. In 1438, because of his fluency in both Greek and Latin, Sagundino was sent to the Council of Ferrara as an official translator. He remained through 1439, impressing the assembled clergy by his grasp of theology. He favoured the cause of church union.After the council, Pope Eugenius IV employed Sagundino as an apostolic secretary on missions in Italy and Greece. This lasted probably until 1441. He returned to Chalkis in 1453 to serve as chancellor (cancelliere) to the bailo of Negroponte, the chief Venetian representative. At the same time he was still acting as a papal representative. After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in that year, he was sent by Venice to negotiate with Sultan Mehmet II. He returned by 1455 with a report on Ottoman ambitions. In that year, Sagundino became a secretary to the doge.Later in 1455, the republic sent Sagundino to deliver his report to Pope Nicholas V in Rome and King Alfonso V of Aragon in Naples. These embassies lasted until 1458, when he was appointed chancellor to the Duke of Crete. He set sail for Crete in July 1460, but the journey was cut short by a shipwreck that took the lives of his pregnant wife, two sons and a daughter and destroyed his books and many other possessions. He resigned his Cretan appointment, but was again appointed secretary to the doge, in which capacity he visited Methoni. He also undertook diplomatic missions to Constantinople and the Empire of Trebizond in 1460.Sagundino died at Venice in March 1464, the exact day being uncertain. It is variously reported as 22 or 23 March, with a surviving notice of his death bearing a date of either 22 or 24 March. His son Giovanni having predeceased him, his heir was his son Ludovico and grandson Niccolò.   "
"Antonio Abbondi generally known as Scarpagnino (died 1549) was an Italian architect of the Renaissance period, active mainly in Venice. [SEP]    Born at Grosio, in Valtellina. In 1505, he became the superintendent of reconstruction for the Fondaco dei Tedeschi in Venice; three years later he was named Proveditore del Sale (""salt curator"") of the city.  After a fire destroyed many buildings in the Rialto on 10 January 1514, he played a role in the reconstruction, competing with Alessandro Leopardi, Giovanni Celeste, and Fra Giovanni Giocondo. Abbondi's designs for the Fabbriche Antiche were accepted, and the construction was completed by 1522, including the newly created Palazzo dei Dieci Savi. Also rebuilt was the church of San Giovanni Elemosinario. On 6 October 1527 he was named the proto-maestro for the Scuola di San Rocco, and designed the upper story.    "
"Antonio Bruti (c. 1518 in Lezhë d. 1571 in Ulcinj) was an Albanian trader, agent, merchant and diplomat, part of the Bruti family, who worked for Venice in the cities of Ulcinj and Ragusa working with Venetian-Ottoman relations. [SEP]    Bruti moved to Ulcinj in 1537 fleeing Ottomans. He had three sons; Bartolomeo, Benedetto and Jacomo. Bruti was married to Maria Bruni, of the Bruni family. Brutis brother, Antonio Bruni, was born in the 1550s. His son was Bartolomeo Bruti (1557-1591) who died in Moldavia from strangulation. Antonio Bruti was educated by the Jesuits.    During his career, Bruti bargained with the Ottomans the grain necessary to feed Catholic Venice. The high costs of wheat caused ""extreme misery"" in the city of Venice forcing the governor of Budva to detain Antonios shipment of wheat. In 1560, Bruti sent a petition to Venice listing the services he had performed. He was Ulcinjs most prominent trader of grain. In 1537 Antonio Bruti commanded a military ship and fought for the defence of Ulcinj and Bar against the Ottomans. During his time in Ulcinj, he tried to shape and form the minds of the local Albanians to join Venice to oppose Ottoman rule In 1570 Antonio Bruti described the walls of Ulcinj as ""weak and extremely dangerous"" According to Venetian historian Andrea Morosini, Antonio Bruti had refused to surrender Ulcinj to the Ottomans and fearing hostility, he threw himself in the ocean and was later captured by Ali Muezinzade Pasha. Noel Malcolm believes that Antonio Bruti was on board on war ships in Corfu in July 1570. He died in 1571 when Ottomans sieged Ulcinj and killed him.   "
"Vincenza Armani (c. 1530 in Venice – 11 September 1569), was an Italian actress, singer, poet, musician, lace maker and sculptor. [SEP]  She was one of the most famous Italian actresses of the period and known as the 'Divine Vincenza Armani'. She and Barbara Flaminia were the two most known actresses of their time and described as great rivals. Being one of the two first well documented actresses in Europe, which was the only country where actresses existed at the time, she belonged to the first actresses in modern Europe.    Vincenza Armani was from Venice. She is first mentioned when she performed the part of a man in the theatre company of Zan Ganassa in Mantua in 1565. She later became the primadonna of the famous commedia dell’arte Gelosi Company of Flaminio Scala. In 1566, Barbara Flaminia is mentioned as her rival of fame, and in 1567, the two performed a famous competition scene in Mantua. The first Italian actress known by name was the actress Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, but Armani was, alongside Barbara Falminia, the first well documented actress in Italy, in Europe, and in commedia dell'arte, and the first Italian primadonna. Aside from acting, she also acted as a singer.  Garzoni called her ""Divina"" and ""A perfect commedienne"" and said of her that:   ""... by demonstrating the same verbal ability as Cicero, she placed the art of acting at the same level as rhetoric.""Aside from her stage career, she wrote poetry and composed songs. She manufactured lace, and sculptures of vax.  Vincenza Armani was reportedly poisoned, possibly by a former lover. Her lover and colleague Adriano Valerini wrote a famous memorial speech to her in 1570.   "
"Jacopo Bassano (c. 1510 – 14 February 1592), known also as Jacopo dal Ponte, was an Italian painter who was born and died in Bassano del Grappa near Venice, and took the village as his surname. [SEP] Trained in the workshop of his father, Francesco the Elder, and studying under Bonifazio Veronese in Venice, he painted mostly religious paintings including landscape and genre scenes . Bassano's pictures were very popular in Venice because of their depiction of animals and nocturnal scenes. His four sons: Francesco Bassano the Younger, Giovanni Battista da Ponte, Leandro Bassano, and Girolamo da Ponte, also became artists and followed him closely in style and subject matter.     He was born around 1510 in the town of Bassano del Grappa, located about 65 km from the city of Venice. His father, Francesco il Vecchio, was a locally successful painter who had established a family workshop that primarily produced religious works in the local style.  During his early youth Bassano was an apprentice in his father's workshop. He eventually made his way to Venice in the 1530s, during which he studied under Bonifazio de Pitati (also known as Bonifazio Veronese) and was exposed to such famous artists as Titian and il Pordenone.  After his father's death in 1539 he returned to Bassano del Grappa and permanently set up residence there, even taking a local woman, Elisabetta Merzari, as his wife in 1546. He took over the management of his family workshop, which would eventually come to include his four sons, Leandro Bassano, Francesco Bassano the Younger, Giovanni Battista da Ponte, and Girolamo da Ponte. After his death in 1592, his sons continued to produce numerous works in his style, making it difficult for later art historians to establish which pieces were created by Jacopo himself and which works were created at the hands of his progeny. Jacopo Bassano was considered unique amongst his fellow Renaissance artists by his ability to incorporate diverse artistic influences (including Dürer, Parmigianino, Tintoretto, and Raphael) into his work despite his reluctance to leave the comfort of his home town. He is believed to have learned about their art by seeing their prints, of which he was most likely an avid collector.   "
"Leandro Bassano (10 June 1557 – 15 April 1622), also called Leandro dal Ponte, was an Italian artist from Bassano del Grappa who was awarded a knighthood by the Doge of Venice. [SEP] He was the younger brother of artist Francesco Bassano the Younger and third son of artist Jacopo Bassano. Their father took his surname from their town of Bassano del Grappa, and trained his sons as painters.     Leandro studied with his brothers in their father's workshop. After Francesco opened a workshop in Venice before 1575, Leandro took over the studio in Bassano del Grappa. Leandro followed in the tradition of his father's religious works, but also became independently well known as a portrait painter. By around 1575, Leandro had become an important assistant to his father. His father wanted Leandro to carry on the studio in Bassano del Grappa. Shortly after their father died, his brother Francesco committed suicide.     Leandro moved to Venice, taking over the family studio there. He became a successful portraitist, working close to the influential style of Venetian master Tintoretto. Leandro developed his style, taking in Venetian influence and furthering his fine drawing style. His approach to painting differed from his father's in the use of ""fine brushwork, with cool, light colours, smoothly applied in well-defined areas, unlike his father, who painted with dense and robust brushstrokes.""  His success grew substantially in Venice. Leandro was awarded a knighthood from Doge of Venice Marino Grimani in 1595. He lived his remaining days in that city, working as a painter. With the knighthood, Leandro began to sign his name with the honorary, “Eques.” Much of his work is not clearly dated, and his works have sometimes been confused with other artists. His Portrait of an Old Man in the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest was once attributed to Tintoretto. In addition to his many portraits and religious pieces, Leandro painted secular, genre works, such as his Concert, now in the Uffizi Gallery, and his Kitchen Scene, displayed in the Indiana University Art Museum in the United States. The Prado Museum in Madrid holds a nice colecction of seven Works by Bassano including religious, portraits, mythological and a veduta similar to other preserved at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando also located in Madrid.

"Giovanni Bembo (21 August 1543 in Venice – 16 March 1618 in Venice) was the 92nd Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on December 2, 1615 until his death. [SEP]  His reign is notable for Venetian victories during the War of Gradisca (1617) and for the Bedmar Plot (1618), in which the Spanish ambassador to Venice, Alfonso de la Cueva, 1st Marquis of Bedmar, was unsuccessful in his  plans to destabilize the Most Serene Republic.    Giovanni was the son of Augustine Bembo and Chiara Del Basso.  The Bembo's were one of the vecchie,  old Venetian noble families.  Giovanni Bembo's mother left him with a large inheritance, which he divided with one brother. Bembo enrolled as a crew of a galley at age 12, and he remained aboard ship for sixteen years.  He fought in the Battle of Lepanto (1571), showing great courage in spite of being wounded repeatedly. Following his good showing in the Battle of Lepanto, Bembo was appointed provveditore.  after which he served with distinction and went on to become savio, consigliere, and subsequently Procurator of St Mark's.     Marcantonio Memmothe elected Doge died on 31 October 1615, leaving no obvious choice as a successor as Doge.  The old noble families (the vecchie faction) were divided between two candidates as doge, while the new noble families (the nuove faction) were unable to unite behind a candidate.  After several rounds of voting, the 41 electors were unable to decide on a candidate, leading to rioting in Venice.  Eventually, on 2 December 1615 a compromise was concluded and Bembo, a moderate member of the vecchie faction, was elected as Doge.  As always, sumptuous feasts were held to celebrate the occasion. For a number of years, Venice had been harassed by Uskoci pirates, encouraged by Ferdinand, Archduke of Inner Austria, who offered the Uskoci his protection.  Bembo's first act as Doge was therefore to declare war on Austria, launching the War of Gradisca (known in German as the Friulian War).  This war saw the destruction of the Uskoci.  The war took place in Friuli, Gradisca d'Isonzo, Gorizia, and Istria.  Venice had the upper hand militarily, with troops under Francesco Erizzo besieging Gradisca d'Isonzo successfully until the arrival of troops commanded by Albrecht von Wallenstein arrived, at which point Venice sued for peace, and a peace treaty was signed in Paris on 27 September 1617. 1617-18 saw Alfonso de la Cueva, 1st Marquis of Bedmar, the Spanish Ambassador to Venice, attempted to destabilize Venice by sowing discord, which would allow Spanish troops to march into Venice and seize control of the city.  Bembo participated in the councils called to stop the Spanish occupation of the city. But Spain believed to have spies in the city were able counter actions of the council allowing the Spanish forces to stay longer in the city. Unfortunately Bembo died while fighting for the liberation of his city from Spanish occupation on 16 March 1618.   "

"Antonio Cappello (1494-1565) was a Venetian noble, a member of the San Polo branch of the Cappello family. [SEP] A Procurator of St Mark's, he acted as ambassador to the court of Charles V at Gand, but is mainly remembered for his role as one of the main promoters of public art and architectural projects in sixteenth-century Venice. He resided in the palazzo on San Polo now known as Ca Cappello Layard and oversaw its redevelopment.    He was born approximately in 1494, the son of Giambattista of Marino Cappello, a merchant and a nobleman, and Paola Garzoni, daughter of Marino Garzoni, who had been prominent in politics as procuratore de Citra, podestà of Verona, podestà of Mantua and finally duke of Candia. Antonio Cappello began his political career at a young age. In 1511 he was vice-podestà of Cologna Veneta, in 1515 an official at the Dogana da Mar - the maritime customs office- and in 1516, with a donation to the Republic of 200 ducats, he secured the office of provveditore and captain in Legnago, in the Verona countryside. There he amassed considerable rural wealth, as tax returns for 1537 show him in agrarian possessions measuring up to 1,200 Venetian campi in area. In 1519 he joined the savi alle decime, then, through a 400 ducat donation he secured access to the pregadi before purchasing for 8,000 ducats the office of procuratore de Supra, one of the two chief procurators of Saint Mark's, tasked with the conservation and expansion of the Basilica. He would maintain the prestigious role for 42 years.    An important evolution in the career of Antonio Cappello was his nomination to provveditor sopra le fabbriche di Legnago- superintended over the fortification works of Legnago- in 1528, following the removal of the incompetent Pietro Tagliapietra. His task was to aid in the construction of the ""fortezza nova"" at Legnago, strongly desired by doge Andrea Gritti, a project under the direction of the commander-in-chief of the Venetian land forces Francesco Maria I della Rovere. The building of the fort however turned out to be a slow and contested process. On 15 December 1530 the chief architect working on the project, the Ferrarese Sigismondo de Fantis was fired for incompetency, to be replaced by his aide, the Veronese Michele Sanmicheli, whose Porta di San Martino had gained considerable acclaim as a tasteful yet function example of military engineering. Problems did not cease and in April 1532 the Republic's authorities, learning that the works were still far behind schedule removed Antonio Cappello from his role as superintendent. Both Michele Sanmichele and Francesco Maria della Rovere however defended his role and actions.    The removal from office at Legnago did not halt his career. In 1533 he was nominated savio alle acque, then procurator in the ""zonta dei nove""- an additional group of councillors that sat with the Council of Ten- then in 1539, together with the duke of Urbino, inspector of the fortresses of the Venetian mainland, and then, on 27 December 1539, with Vincenzo Grimani, special ambassador to the courts of Francis I in France and emperor Charles V in Flanders, with the objective of convincing the two rival monarchs to set aside their differences and join Venice in an anti-Ottoman coalition. The embassy did not however obtain significant political results: Francis I valued his Ottoman allies, and so the Venetians made for Charles V's court, where they were well received and Antonio Cappello received the title of count imperial, but failed to secure meaningful military support. In the following years, Antonio Cappello was appointed to more prestigious public offices: he sat in the consiglio alle acque, then in the committee that superintended the fortifications of Zadar, then he was provveditor over the Republic's fortifications, In 1543 finally he was dispatched to negotiate the purchase of the fortress of Marano Lagunare in eastern Friuli, seized the previous year by a band of rogue Venetian subjects loyal to Florentine renegade adventurer Piero Strozzi from the Austrians, and which threatened to draw the Republic into the Italian War of 1542-46 then raging between Habsburgs and Valois. The affair was concluded with the hefty disbursement in favour of Piero Strozzi of 35,000 ducats, in exchange of which the Venetians gained the small but strategic town.    The offices where he left the greatest mark were certainly those of artistic and architectural patronage. As procurator of Saint Mark's he was responsible of substantial restoration interventions in the Basilica of Saint Mark's, and also of the commencement of works on the Biblioteca Marciana. His experience in overseeing construction work saw him nominated as superintended over the bridge and works at Rialto together with Tommaso Contarini and Vettor Grimani for the period between January 1551 and November 1554, where he oversaw proposals for the redesigning of Rialto Bridge and the beginning of the works. He was renominated to the post with Gianbattista Grimani between October 1555 and October 1556 and continued to oversee the construction of the bridge. In the same year he was nominated superintended over works at the Ducal Palace, where he oversaw important works of reconstruction and redecoration, such as the repainting by Giovanni Battista Zelotti and Paolo Veronese of the ceiling of the room of the Council of Ten. He also led the council of fifteen patricians that oversaw the building of the Golden Staircase in the Ducal Palace. This frontal role in the management of artistic and cultural policy in Venice put Antonio Cappello at the centre of an important artistic network. Significant in this sense was the friendship that tied him to architect Michele Sanmicheli from their shared days in Legnago, and this brought him to commission to Michele Sanmicheli important works. Not only that, but two of Sanmicheli's artistic protégés, Giovanni Battista Zelotti and Paolo Veronese, received from him important commissions.    It is not surprising that a man who promoted the Republic's political advancement through a cultivated cultural policy thought to advance his own personal political career through artistic patronage. As such Antonio Cappello organized a substantial reorganization of the Gothic palazzo he inherited on the Grand Canal, Ca’ Cappello, that culminated with Giovanni Battista Zelotti and Veronese creating a large fresco-cycle with mythological scenes. The frescoes were damaged by fire and had worn out by the nineteenth century, but in his 1648 Carlo Ridolfi could still see them ""above the Grand Canal in the house of the Cappelli [Veronese] coloured some figures of Cerere, Pomona, Pallas and other deities, while those above were coloured by his friend Zelotti"". Anton Maria Zanetti thought them very notable in the 1760 and had engravings made of the surviving figures.   "

From 1570-1573 he was Ambassador to Savoy, then for a short time Ambassador to Poland, and from 1576-1579 he was Ambassador to France.  He served in some temporary ambassadorships and then was a member of the council that elected the Doge prior to his appointment as Bailo of Constantinople in 1589.   "
"Vincenzo Cappello (Venice, 1469 – 19 August 1541) was a Venetian nobleman and statesman, best known as the admiral of the Venetian navy in the Battle of Preveza. [SEP]    Vincenzo Cappello was born in Venice in 1469, to Nicolò Cappello. He is first noticed at Milan in October 1499, when he unsuccessfully tried to sell a ""necklace of the King of the Romans (""collar fo dil re di romani"") to King Louis XII of France. On 30 August 1502, and again on 28 March 1504, he was appointed to the post of state treasurer (camerlengo de Comùn).    In June 1504, he was given charge of the great trade galley convoy (muda) to Flanders and London, one of the most lucrative commercial routes of the time.After months of preparations, the convoy sailed in February 1505. The journey proved successful, so that by July 1506, the Venetian ships were so laden with merchandise for the return journey that 300 balls of wool had to be left behind.On 27 July 1506 Cappello was received by King Henry VII of England, who awarded him trading privileges, knighted him, and gave him the right to include the Tudor rose in his own arms. As representative of the Republic of Venice, Cappello also received the King's messages of goodwill and alliance to the Republic. On the return journey, Cappello's good fortune was again apparent: attacked by Genoese warship that thought he was a pirate, and brought to Cagliari, he not only managed to have his identity confirmed there, but also gathered new merchandise to the value of 6,000 ducats.On his return to Venice on 28 November 1506, his ships, laden with goods, made a great impression and secured him considerable wealth, which Cappello employed in pursuing a political career.    In April 1509, Cappello disclosed that he had loaned 10,000 ducats to the Republic. Although this was denied, it helped his popularity, and his election to the Venetian Senate was quick. While enjoying considerable popularity, he nevertheless also had detractors who accused him of intending to dominate the state.    Boosted by his popularity, he was elected to the senior office of superintendent of the Venetian navy (Provveditore all'Armata) on 14 January 1512. In this position, he displayed great skills and knowledge of naval matters, as well as political maturity. The navy was in poor shape at the time, lacking organization, men, and even hardtack for the ships.  Although he tried to remedy the situation, this shortage led to some bitter experiences: in July 1514, at Corfu, lack of hardtack forced him to cease pursuit of a fleet of twenty Ottoman fustas, while in December 1515 he was forced to disband his fleet at Istria, as the officers and crews demanded their delayed pay. As a result, in his customary report (relazione) to the Venetian government, he severely criticized the navy's organization. In the meantime, he briefly participated in the defence of Padua in February 1514 (during the War of the League of Cambrai), before going to suppress, with considerable harshness, the Hvar rebellion.     In December 1515 he was appointed as fortress commander (capitano) at Famagusta on Cyprus, after a gift of 2,000 ducats to the Republic. Cappello found the fortifications of Famagusta utterly insufficient to face an Ottoman attack, and denounced the behaviour of the Venetian officials on the island as ""scandalous"". Being firmly convinced of the ""bad faith"" of the Ottomans, he devoted himself to strengthening the defences of the city, which he achieved with only a modest additional monthly spending of 400 ducats. His successor, Bartolomeo Contarini, who replaced him in March 1519, expressly praised his work.    Leaving Famagusta on 10 March 1519, on 29 July he was back in Venice, resuming his career in the Republic's government. He refused a nomination as superintendent of fleet provisions and equipment (Provveditore all'Armar) on 16 August, but instead became a member of the Council of Ten on 16 October. On 19 June 1520, he became ducal councillor (consigliere ducale) for the sestiere of Santa Croce, and lieutenant-governor (luogotenente) of Friuli on 9 September 1520. From this position he carefully observed Ottoman military moves in Dalmatia. He returned to Venice on 7 June 1522. He was elected as an orator to the new Pope, Adrian VI, in August, he did not go to Rome because of the outbreak of the plague there, and himself contracted an illness that forced him to stay at Ferrara. He became consigliere of the sestiere of Cannaregio on 26 May 1523, and refused an appointment as Duke of Candia on 27 September. In October, he participated in an inquest into the activities of the Ten and ""against the sects and the suborners of the public offices"". Again elected orator to the newly elected Pope Clement VII on 26 November, he declined due to renewed poor health.On 3 May 1524 he was member of the board of the Savi a Tansar, followed by election as superintendent on sales (Provveditore sopra le Vendite) on 9 December. On 1 February 1525, he was elected one of the three consiglieri da basso who represented the Doge at the criminal appeals court, the Council of Forty (Quarantia Criminale), and on 30 September 1526 one of the forty elected to the zonta. On 1 September 1527 he again became a member of the Ten, and on 3 October 1527 one of the reviewers of the accounts of the Ten (revedadori di le Casse).    On 5 March 1529, he was appointed one of the seven Savi di Terraferma, on 1 August, as consigliere ""beyond the Canal"", and finally, on 12 September, again as Provveditore all'Armata. Conscious of the fleet's problems, Cappello made specific demands to accept the position, requiring the government to furnish sufficient men, hardtack, and funds. His quarrels with the Senate delayed his departure and left a legacy of tense relations, which survived despite his re-appointment to the post on 11 June 1532.  Tasked with ""restoring order to the fleet"", but without provoking either the Turks or the Holy Roman Emperor, Cappello found his assignment fraught with worries. Reappointed to his post in 1534, in his reports to the Senate, he elaborated on the lack of hardtack, the desertion of his men to the Emperor's better-paying forces, the inadequacy of the fortifications in the Republic's overseas possessions (especially Zara, Sebenico, and Corfu), and the inefficiency of the naval construction system. As the historian Achille Olivieri points out, however, Cappello was no reformer: his outlook remained grounded in practical, everyday reality eschewing great risks and ideals in favour of a Venetian state secure in its strength, immobile, and almost ""removed from the disruptive dialectic of the historical process"".In 1535, he was elected ducal councillor for the sestiere of Castello. Following the outbreak of the Third Ottoman–Venetian Wari in 1537, he was elected as Provveditore all'Armata. The fleet of Venice and its allies (chief among them Habsburg Spain) captured the fortress of Castelnuovo, leaving behind a Spanish garrison, but was defeated by the Ottoman navy at the Battle of Preveza in September 1538. Blamed by the Spanish for the defeat and taken ill, he returned to Venice, where he became a member of the Savi Grandi.  In January 1539 he participated in the election of Pietro Lando as Doge, and was elected as Procurator of St. Mark de supra.He died on 19 August 1541, and was buried at the church of Santa Maria Formosa, whose façade is decorated with his statue.

"Cecilia Contarini (fl. 1578) was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Sebastiano Venier (r. 1577-1578). She married the future doge in 1544. [SEP] Along with her spouse, she reportedly preferred to avoid ceremony and public life and lived secluded in the palace. She greeted officials in the doge's stead, such as when that Brescian embassy came full of ""gratitude for precious services and in token of the devotion and infinite love felt for his Serenity by all the citizens of our city""; they were received by the dogaressa without ceremony, who told them: ""I much fear he will be unwilling to accept your offering but I will go and hear what he says."" Unlike other dowager dogaressas she was not expected to become a nun but provided with a pension and provisions similar to that of Zilia Dandolo, and was one of three dogaressas depicted in the Cerimoniali (1464- 1592) alongside Zilia Dandolo and Loredana Marcello.

"Leonardo Donà, or Donato (Venice, February 12, 1536 – Venice, July 16, 1612) was the 90th Doge of Venice, reigning from January 10, 1606 until his death. [SEP]  His reign is chiefly remembered for Venice's dispute with the papacy, which resulted in Pope Paul V placing a papal interdict on Venice 1606–1607.    The son of Giovanni Battista Donato and Giovanna Corner, Donato was born into a merchant family.  Through his shrewd business sense, he was able to turn his family's average amount of wealth into a fortune.   His wealth established, Donato began a public career in Venice, serving in turn as the Venetian ambassador to Constantinople, podestà of Venice, and as governor and Procurator of St Mark's.   Donato later served as the Venetian ambassador to the Vatican and lived at Rome for many years.  His opposition to the ambitions of the papacy led him to conflict with Cardinal Borghese, the future Pope Paul V.  Donato's staunchly anti-papal stance led to rumours that he was secretly a Protestant, although historians have not found any evidence of this.    Donato became one of the candidates for Doge upon the death of Marino Grimani on December 25, 1605.  Donato faced two opponents in this election (including Marcantonio Memmo, who would eventually succeed him as Doge), but ultimately received both of their support, resulting in his election as Doge on January 10, 1606. Donato inherited a conflict with the papacy from Grimani: Between 1601 and 1604, Venice, under Grimani's leadership, had passed a number of laws limiting the power of the papacy within the Republic of Venice and withdrawing a number of clerical privileges.  This came to a head in late 1605 when Venice charged two priests as common criminals, thus denying their clerical immunity from facing charges in secular courts. On December 10, 1605, two weeks before Grimani's death, Pope Paul V sent a formal protest to Venice. Shortly after his election as Doge, Donato, at the urging of Paolo Sarpi, rejected Paul V's protest.  As a result, in April 1606, Paul V issued a papal interdict on Venice, thus excommunicating the entire Venetian population.  At Sarpi's urging, Donato ordered all Roman Catholic clergy to ignore the Pope's interdict and continue to perform the mass, on pain of immediate expulsion from the Venetian Republic.  The Venetian clergy all continued to perform mass, except for the Jesuits, who left the Republic (or were expelled depending on one's perspective) rather than violate the papal interdict.  The Jesuits would not return to Venice until 1655.  Donato and Sarpi were also personally excommunicated by Paul V.  The Kingdom of France acted as a mediator in the dispute between Venice and the papacy.  On April 21, 1607, a deal was reached under which the two priests that Venice had charged as common criminals would be handed over to French custody, and, in exchange, the pope would remove the interdict against Venice. The remainder of Donato's reign as Doge is largely without note.  Donato was not at all popular with the Venetian crowd, so, after his first year as Doge, Donato significantly restricted his public appearances as Doge.  Many rumours circulated about the reclusive Donato during these years, but none were ever substantiated.  He died on July 16, 1612.   "
"Moderata Fonte, pseudonym of Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi (or Zorzi), also known as Modesto Pozzo (or Modesta, feminization of Modesto),  (1555–1592) was a Venetian writer and poet. [SEP]  Besides the posthumously-published dialogues, Giustizia delle donne and Il merito delle donne (gathered in The Worth of Women, 1600), for which she is best known, she wrote a romance and religious poetry. Details of her life are known from the biography by Giovanni Niccolò Doglioni (1548-1629), her uncle, included as a preface to the dialogue.     Pozzo's parents, Girolamo da Pozzo and Marietta da Pozzo (née dal Moro), died of the plague in 1556, when she was just a year old, and she and her older brother Leonardo were placed in the care of their maternal grandmother and her second husband.  She spent several years in the convent of Santa Marta where, thanks to her extraordinary memory, she was often displayed as a child prodigy.  She was able to repeat long sermons she had heard or read only once. At the age of nine she was returned to her grandmother’s family where she learned Latin and composition from her grandfather, Prospero Saraceni, a man of letters, as well as from her brother, Leonardo. Her brother also taught her to read and write in Latin, draw, sing, and play the lute and harpsichord. On 15 February 1582, at twenty-seven years old, Moderata wed Filippo de’ Zorzi.  Their marriage seemed to reflect equality and mutual respect evidenced by de’ Zorzi returning her dowry a year and a half after their wedding. An official document dated October 1583 states that de’ Zorzi returns the dowry ""thanks to his pure kindness and to the great love and good will that he has felt and feels for"" her. Likewise, Moderata Fonte describes her husband in one of her writings as a man of ""virtue, goodness and integrity"". These actions were significant in this time period, since women did not typically have property under their own name with which they could govern. Furthermore, the appeal for women to own property has been a longstanding debate in feminist advocacy.    "
"Ioannis Phokas (Greek:  ), better known by the Spanish translation of his name, Juan de Fuca (born 1536 on the Ionian island of Cefalonia; died there 1602), was a Greek maritime pilot in the service of the King of Spain, Philip II. [SEP]  He is best known for his claim to have explored the Strait of Anián, now known as the Strait of Juan de Fuca, between Vancouver Island (now part of British Columbia, Canada) and the Olympic Peninsula (northwestern Washington state, United States).    Phokás's grandfather, Emmanouíl Phokás ( ), fled Constantinople at its fall in 1453, accompanied by his brother Andrónikos ().  The two settled first in the Peloponnese, where Andrónikos remained, but in 1470 Emmanouel moved to the island of Cefalonia. Iákovos (), Ioánnis's father, established himself in the village of Valerianos () on the island and came to be known as ""the Valeriáno Fokás"" (Gr:   ) to distinguish him from his brothers.It was in this village of Valeriáno that Phokás was born in 1536. Little to nothing is known about his life before he entered the service of Spain, some time around 1555.    The name of the man known to history as Juan de Fuca is the source of some confusion.  While Juan de Fuca is clearly a Spanish rendering of Ioánnis Phokás ( ), some sources cite Apóstolos Valeriános ( ) as his ""real"" name.  It is possible that Phokás was baptized Apóstolos and later adopted the name Ioánnis/Juan (i.e., John) because Apóstol is not much used as a name in Spanish.  Given that Fokás/Fuca was the family name borne by the seafarer's father and grandfather, Valeriános is likely to be a nickname used on the island which would have been quite meaningless in the Spanish Empire.    De Fuca's early voyages were to the Far East, and he claimed to have arrived in New Spain in 1587 when, off Cabo San Lucas in Baja California, the English privateer Thomas Cavendish seized his galleon Santa Ana and deposited him ashore. He was a well-traveled seaman, perfecting his skill as a pilot in the Spanish fleet. The King of Spain, he also claimed, recognized him for his excellence and made him pilot of the Spanish navy in the West Indies (a title he held for forty years), but there is no record in Spanish Archives of his name or position or of his visit to the royal court. Before he made his famous trip up the northwest coast of the North American continent, he sailed to China, the Philippines and Mexico. The Strait of Juan de Fuca between the United States of America and Canada was named for him by British Captain Charles Barkley because it was at the same latitude that Juan de Fuca described as the location of the Strait of Anián.     According to de Fuca's account, he undertook two voyages of exploration on the orders of the Viceroy of New Spain, Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas, both intended to find the fabled Strait of Anián, believed to be a Northwest Passage, a sea route linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  The first voyage saw 200 soldiers and three small ships under the overall command of a Spanish captain (with de Fuca as pilot and master) assigned the task of finding the Strait of Anián and fortifying it against the English. This expedition failed when, allegedly due to the captain's malfeasance, the soldiers mutinied and returned home to California.  (Note that in this period, Spanish doctrine divided control of ships and fleets between the military commander, who was an army officer, and the sailing and navigation commander, who was a mariner.) In 1592, on his second voyage, de Fuca enjoyed success.  Having sailed north with a caravel and a pinnace and a few armed marines, he returned to Acapulco and claimed to have found the strait, with a large island at its mouth, at around 47° north latitude. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is in fact at around 48° N, although Fuca's account of sailing into it departs from reality, describing a region far different from what actually existed there.  During the voyage, de Fuca also noted a ""high pinnacle or spired rock"", which may have been Fuca Pillar, a tall, almost rectangular, rock on the western shore of Cape Flattery on the northwestern tip of Washington beside the Strait of Juan de Fuca - although de Fuca noted it being on the other side of the strait.Despite Velasco's repeated promises, however, de Fuca never received the great rewards he claimed as his due. After two years, and on the viceroy's urging, de Fuca travelled to Spain to make his case to the court in person. Disappointed again and disgusted with the Spanish, the aging Greek determined to retire to his home in Kefallonia, but was in 1596 convinced by an Englishman, Michael Lok (also spelled as Locke in English and French documents from the period), to offer his services to Spain's archenemy, Queen Elizabeth. Nothing came of Lok and de Fuca's proposals, but it is through Lok's account that the story of Juan de Fuca entered English letters.     Because the only written evidence for Fokás's voyages lay in Lok's account — researchers being unable to find records of the expedition in Spanish colonial archives — there was long much controversy over his discovery and, indeed, whether he had ever even existed as a real person;  several scholars have dismissed Juan de Fuca as entirely fictitious, and the 18th-century British explorer Captain Cook strongly doubted that the strait Fokás claimed to have discovered even existed (although Cook actually sailed past the Strait of Juan de Fuca without entering it and did stop at Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island). With later English exploration and settlement of the area, however, Fokás's claims seemed much more credible. Finally, in 1859, an American researcher, with the help of the U.S. Consul in the Ionian Islands, was able to demonstrate not only that Fokás had lived but also that his family and history were well known on the islands.  While we may never know the exact truths that lay behind the account published by Lok, it must be considered unlikely that the man himself was fictional.    When the English captain Charles William Barkley, sailing the Imperial Eagle in 1787, (re)discovered the strait Fokás had described, he renamed it the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Juan de Fuca Plate, a tectonic plate underlying much of the coastline he explored, is named for the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Juan de Fuca Provincial Park on Vancouver Island's West Coast is named for the strait, as is the hiking trail of the same name.   "
"Giovanni Gabrieli (c. 1554/1557 – 12 August 1612) was an Italian composer and organist. [SEP] He was one of the most influential musicians of his time, and represents the culmination of the style of the Venetian School, at the time of the shift from Renaissance to Baroque idioms.    Gabrieli was born in Venice. He was one of five children, and his father came from the region of Carnia and went to Venice shortly before Giovanni's birth. While not much is known about Giovanni's early life, he probably studied with his uncle, the composer Andrea Gabrieli, who was employed at St Mark's Basilica from the 1560s until his death in 1585. Giovanni may indeed have been brought up by his uncle, as is implied by the dedication to his 1587 book of concerti, in which he described himself as ""little less than a son"" to his uncle.Giovanni also went to Munich to study with the renowned Orlando de Lassus at the court of Duke Albert V; most likely he stayed there until about 1579. Lassus was to be one of the principal influences on the development of his musical style.By 1584 he had returned to Venice, where he became principal organist at St Mark's Basilica in 1585, after Claudio Merulo left the post; following his uncle's death the following year he took the post of principal composer as well. Also after his uncle's death he began editing much of the older man's music, which would otherwise have been lost; Andrea evidently had had little inclination to publish his own music, but Giovanni's opinion of it was sufficiently high that he devoted much of his own time to compiling and editing it for publication. Gabrieli's career rose further when he took the additional post of organist at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, another post he retained for his entire life. San Rocco was the most prestigious and wealthy of all the Venetian confraternities, and second only to San Marco itself in the splendor of its musical establishment. Some of the most renowned singers and instrumentalists in Italy performed there and a vivid description of its musical activity survives in the travel memoirs of the English writer Thomas Coryat. Much of his music was written specifically for that location, although he probably composed even more for San Marco. San Marco had a long tradition of musical excellence and Gabrieli's work there made him one of the most noted composers in Europe. The vogue that began with his influential volume Sacrae symphoniae (1597) was such that composers from all over Europe, especially from Germany, came to Venice to study. Evidently he also instructed his new pupils to study the madrigals being written in Italy, so not only did they carry back the grand Venetian polychoral style to their home countries, but also the more intimate style of madrigals; Heinrich Schütz and others helped transport the transitional early Baroque music north to Germany, a trend that decisively affected subsequent music history. The productions of the German Baroque, culminating in the music of J.S. Bach, were founded on this strong tradition, which had its roots in Venice. Gabrieli was increasingly ill after about 1606, at which time church authorities began to appoint deputies to take over duties he could no longer perform. He died in 1612 in Venice, of complications from a kidney stone.     Though Gabrieli composed in many of the forms current at the time, he preferred sacred vocal and instrumental music. All of his secular vocal music is relatively early in his career; he never wrote lighter forms, such as dances; and later he concentrated on sacred vocal and instrumental music that exploited sonority for maximum effect. Among the innovations credited to him – and while he was not always the first to use them, he was the most famous of his period to do so – were dynamics; specifically notated instrumentation (as in the famous Sonata pian' e forte); and massive forces arrayed in multiple, spatially separated groups, an idea which was to be the genesis of the Baroque concertato style, and which spread quickly to northern Europe, both by the report of visitors to Venice and by Gabrieli's students, which included Hans Leo Hassler and Heinrich Schütz.Like composers before and after him, he would use the unusual layout of the San Marco church, with its two choir lofts facing each other, to create striking spatial effects. Most of his pieces are written so that a choir or instrumental group will first be heard on one side, followed by a response from the musicians on the other side; often there was a third group situated on a stage near the main altar in the center of the church. While this polychoral style had been extant for decades (Adrian Willaert may have made use of it first, at least in Venice) Gabrieli pioneered the use of carefully specified groups of instruments and singers, with precise directions for instrumentation, and in more than two groups. The acoustics were and are such in the church that instruments, correctly positioned, could be heard with perfect clarity at distant points. Thus instrumentation which looks strange on paper, for instance a single string player set against a large group of brass instruments, can be made to sound, in San Marco, in perfect balance. A fine example of these techniques can be seen in the scoring of In Ecclesiis. Gabrieli's first motets were published alongside his uncle Andrea's compositions in his 1587 volume of Concerti. These pieces show much influence of his uncle's style in the use of dialogue and echo effects. There are low and high choirs and the difference between their pitches is marked by the use of instrumental accompaniment. The motets published in Giovanni's 1597 Sacrae Symphoniae seem to move away from this technique of close antiphony towards a model in which musical material is not simply echoed, but developed by successive choral entries. Some motets, such as Omnes Gentes developed the model almost to its limits. In these motets, instruments are an integral part of the performance, and only the choirs marked ""Capella"" are to be performed by singers for each part.There seems to be a distinct change in Gabrieli's style after 1605, the year of publication of Monteverdi's Quinto libro di madrigali, and Gabrieli's compositions are in a much more homophonic style as a result. There are sections purely for instruments – called ""Sinfonia"" – and small sections for soloists singing florid lines, accompanied simply by a basso continuo. ""Alleluia"" refrains provide refrains within the structure, forming rondo patterns in the motets, with close dialogue between choirs and soloists. In particular, one of his best-known pieces, In Ecclesiis, is a showcase of such polychoral techniques, making use of four separate groups of instrumental and singing performers, underpinned by the omnipresent organ and continuo.    The Italian term canzon, plural canzoni, as used by Gabrieli and others, derives from the French word “chanson,” and soon after Gabrieli’s time it was fully drawn into the Italian language as canzona, plural canzone. English uses this second Italian form, with canzonas as the plural.   "
"The Gliubizza or Giubizza were a Venetian family active in Ulcinj in the second half of the 16th century.

Andrea Giubizza was the Roman Catholic bishop of Ulcinj from 1558 until his death in 1565.Alessandro Giubizza (fl. 1575–76) from Ulcinj had been employed at the court of Koca Sinan Pasha in Istanbul, then moved to Kotor where he is recorded in 1576. He gave information to the Venetian government in January 1576. Alessandro had been taken captive after the Ottoman capture of Ulcinj, but managed to have himself ransomed. His sister and nephew were released by Sinan Pasha, after which Alessandro stayed in Istanbul and became close with Mehmed Bey, Sinan Pasha's nephew. Alessandro and these came to an agreement that he would be informed of events against Venetian interest in the Kotor and border areas, in return he would buy luxury goods for Mehmed Bey in Venice. Alessandro called Sinan Pasha an Albanian and 'the first cousin of my mother'. Noel Malcolm believes that the family had a close family tie with Sinan Pasha, possibly through the Bruti family.   "

"Loredana Marcello (died 12 December 1572) was a Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Alvise I Mocenigo (r. 1570-1577). She was an author of letters and poetry and studied botany, and was regarded as a model of an educated and cultivated renaissance woman in contemporary Venice. [SEP]    She was the daughter of Giovanni Alvise Marcello and married Mocenigo in 1533. Together with her sisters Bianca, Daria and Maria, she was referred to as fiore de'l secolo and regarded to represent the ideal of the educated renaissance woman for the nobility in Venice, and was, as multi talented, referred to as Giantessa di merito.She was regarded a scholar, described as attractive and educated, and was the author of letters and poetry. She also studied botany, and was a student of a professor of the Biological Garden in Padua, Melchiorre Giuliandino. She was known for the formulas and recipes she developed for use against plagues. Presumably these were palliatives rather than cures. Her work is lost, but her botanical research it is noted to have been consulted and put to good use during the epidemic which appeared in Venice few years after her death (1575).She became dogaressa upon the election of her spouse as doge in 1570, but died two years later.

"Lucrezia Marinella (1571-1653) was an Italian poet, author, and an advocate of women's rights. [SEP] She is best known for her writing The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men.    Lucrezia Marinella was the daughter of a celebrated physician and natural philosopher, Giovanni Marinelli who wrote novels, some of which were on women’s well-being, hygiene and beauty. Although her father was not from Venice, Lucrezia and her family were ""cittadinaza."" Her brother, Curzo Marinella, was also a physician and Lucrezia married the physician Girolamo Vacca. None of her children seem to have been born in Venice. Her father might have been the vital link between her private studies and the writing and the wider world of Venetian literary circles, including the Accademia de’ Desiosi.In this era, many women entered convents or became courtesans (like the famous Veronica Franco). Entering a convent meant that a woman was not obligated to be married and could pursue education and spiritual development. But, at the same time the Roman Catholic Church maintained rigid theories of gender and expectations of women’s place and nature. However, Lucrezia Marinella did not enter the convent and wasn't pressured into marriage. She came from a professional family that very much encouraged her studies, and her father was extremely supportive.Although Lucrezia’s writing brought her fame, she lived her life in seclusion. It is believed that Lucrezia's solitary life is what allowed her to write so much so soon. But a life of seclusion was typical for women of her social rank in sixteenth-century Italy.  She did not travel, except to local shrines, there is no evidence she gathered with other authors for discussions, and there is no record of her even attending meetings held in academies outside.    Women’s rights and the equality of women were a major focus of Marinella's writings. In the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance era in Italy, women were largely wives and mothers. Many women who wanted to pursue knowledge either had to be of elite standing, enter convents, or become courtesans. Women were normally not a part of political conversations and had to be extraordinary to be fully recognized in literature.Although Marinella was one of the best recognized female writers of the time, which included Moderata Fonte, Arcangela Tarabotti and Veronica Franco. Marinella’s works mostly dealt with women’s rights and she even asserted that women were superior to men, which was a popular argument in that time for polemical and philosophical works. Marinella also wrote in the style of pastoral romance, as in Arcadia Felice. This genre was traditionally limited to male authors and featured male characters;  however Arcadia Felice explores love and eroticism as a plot complication instead of a resolution.   "
"Marcantonio Memmo (Venice, November 11, 1536 – Venice, October 31, 1615) was the 91st Doge of Venice, reigning from July 24, 1612 until his death. [SEP]    The son of Giovanni Memmo and Bianca Sanudo, he was born into a family of average wealth. He went into business as a merchant and made a fortune through his careful management. As a prominent Venetian, he traversed the Venetian cursus honorum, becoming in turn, provveditore, podestà, and Procurator of St Mark's. He was set to become doge in 1606, but was not helped by the fact that the Memmo were one of the ""vecchie"" (""old""), Venetian noble families and every doge from 1382 on had been a member of one of the ""nuove"" (""new"") Venetian noble families. He was thus unable to win support for his election in 1606, and lost out to Leonardo Donato.    Memmo used the years of Donato's reign to maneuver behind the scenes, swinging into high gear following Donato's death on 16 July 1612.  When the election was held on July 24, 1612, Memmo was elected on the first ballot, with 38 of the 41 votes, a shock to the nuove faction that had dominated the position of Doge for centuries. Great festivals were organized to celebrate Memmo's victory, and, like previous Doges, he would use the celebrations that attended great holidays as a way to curry favor with the population of Venice.   Little of note happened in Memmo's reign as Doge, except for an incursion of Uskoci pirates in 1613. He died on October 31, 1615.   "
"Giovan Francesco Morosini or Gianfrancesco Morosini (30 September 1537 – 14 January 1596) was a Venetian Catholic cardinal who served as Bishop of Brescia and Apostolic Nuncio in France. [SEP]    Giovanni Francesco Morosini was born in Venice on 30 September 1537. He was the son of the Venetian patricians Pietro Morosini and Cornelia Corner, sister of cardinals Luigi and Federico Corner. His father, member of the Council of Ten, committed suicide on 21 March 1570. Still young, he accompanied a relative in France, Alvise Badoer, who had been appointed extraordinary ambassador to that kingdom on behalf of the Republic of Venice. When he returned home, he was sent by the Republic of Venice to Charles II, Archduke of Austria, and on 1 May 1568 he was sent to the court of Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, always as legate, leaving Turin on 29 September 1570.In June 1573 Morosini was sent to Henry of Valois to pay homage to him on behalf of the Republic of Venice in the recent success of his obtaining the Polish crown. In December of that same year, he was appointed ambassador of Venice to the court of Charles IX of France, remaining there until the election of Henry III of France. From 1582 to 1585 he served as bailo to the Sultan Murad III in Constantinople.In early 1585 Pope Gregory XIII selected him as new bishop of Brescia after a secret consultation among the clergy of Venice, and this decision was confirmed by the new pope Sixtus V, who formally appointed him bishop of Brescia on 23 September 1585. Morosini at that time was still a layman, and he was ordained priest on October 1585 in Venice. The episcopal consecration followed on 3 November in the Venetian Church of San Giorgio Maggiore by the hands of Cesare Costa, Apostolic Nuncio to Venice.Sixtus V sent him as his Apostolic Nuncio in France in May 1587. In the France scarred by the Wars of Religion, the duty of the Nuncio was to support the politic of Catherine de' Medici in trying to ally Henry III with the Catholic League led by the Henry I, Duke of Guise against the Huguenots. To support the Catholic war he was allowed by the Pope to sell estates of the Church, but this was fiercely opposed by the French clergy. Nor he succeeded to have the decrees of the Council of Trent published in French. He asked to the Pope to side with Henry III against the Duke of Guise, but this position was not supported by the Pope who more and more became displeased of his nuncio. In the events of the Day of the Barricades he tried to riconciliate the leaders of the Catholic League with Henry III. A few months later, the murders of Louis II, Cardinal of Guise and of the Duke of Guise by order of Henry III marked the failure of his politic.In the meantime, on 15 July 1588 he was elected Cardinal priest with the title of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, in 1590 modified with the title of Santa Maria in Via.Returned in Italy from France in September 1589, he went to Rome where he was charged of not having excommunicated Henry III of France after the murders of the Cardinal and of the Duke of Guise by order of that king.Appointed protector of Germany and Hungary, he was a close friend of San Filippo Neri and his supporter. He died in Brescia on 14 January 1596 and buried in the Old Cathedral of that town. He left his goods to the hospital of Brescia.   "
"Palma Vecchio (c. 1480 – 30 July 1528), born Jacopo Palma and also known as Jacopo Negretti, was a Venetian painter of the Italian High Renaissance. [SEP] He was born at Serina Alta near Bergamo, a dependency of the Republic of Venice, but his recorded career all took place in or near Venice.  He is called Palma Vecchio in English (""Palma the Elder"", in Italian Palma il Vecchio) to distinguish him from Palma il Giovane (""Palma the Younger"", 1548/50-1628), his great-nephew, who was also a painter. Palma is first recorded in Venice in 1510, but had probably already been there for some time.  He was perhaps apprenticed to Andrea Previtali, who also came from Bergamo, and who returned there in 1511.   Palma's earlier works show the influence of Giovanni Bellini, Previtali's master and by then the aged doyen of Venetian painting, but Palma came to follow the new style and subjects pioneered by Giorgione and Titian. After the deaths of Bellini and Giorgione, and the removal from Venice of Sebastiano del Piombo, Lorenzo Lotto and Previtali, before long Palma found himself, after Titian, the leading painter in Venice, much in demand until his early death at the age of 48 (according to Vasari; his date of birth is calculated from this). His stock has been rising somewhat in recent decades, as more attributions are removed from Giorgione and Titian and given to him; his ""sheer painterly capacity"" in the handling of paint and colour is extremely fine.He painted the new pastoral mythologies and half-length portraits, often of idealized beauties who, then as now, were enticingly suspected of being portraits of Venice's famous courtesans.  He also painted religious pieces, in particular developing the sacra conversazione (the Virgin and Child with a group of saints and perhaps donors) in a horizontal form with a landscape background.  In other, secular, groups something seems to occurring between the figures, though exactly what is unclear.  All these types of painting were patronized by wealthy Venetians for their homes.He also painted traditional vertical altarpieces for churches inside Venice and around the Venetian territories on the mainland. However, he was not commissioned to paint a main altar in Venice until 1525, at Sant'Elena, Venice (now Brera, Milan). He was quick to absorb influences from other parts of Italy, sometimes copying poses from Michelangelo, and taking influence from Central Italy from about 1515 into the 1520s.  Palma's mature work from the 1520s shows a ""High Renaissance style, characterized by his mastery of contrapposto, the enrichment of his high-keyed palette and the development of a dignified and diverse repertory of ideal human types in conservative compositions. These qualities dominated his work to the exclusion of dramatic chiaroscuro, spatial experiment, expressionism and innovative composition.""  Critical opinion is rather divided as whether the art from shortly before his sudden death was continuing to develop, or had lost energy and direction.  S.J. Freedburg sees his career as oscillating between the influences of Titian and other north and Central Italian trends, including Mannerism.  He had a workshop about which little certain is known, and may have taught Bonifazio Pitati, who he certainly influenced, as he did Giovanni Busi.   "
"Azaria Piccio (Hebrew:    , Azarya ben Efrayim Figo; 1579–5 or 6 February 1647) was a Venetian Talmudist, sofer (scribe) and darshan (preacher) who served in the Jewish communities of Venice and Pisa.Born [SEP] in Venice and originally a scholar of things secular, Piccio eventually devoted himself to the study of the Talmud. Owing to his background, his preaching was heavily laced with scientific, especially medical, references. His sermons were also composed according to Classical models. He was especially close to his mentor Leone de Modena, with whom he shared an openness toward the modern world. David B. Ruderman writes that “while [Piccio] argues for the insufficiency of the sciences, he clearly does not dismiss their validity altogether.”Piccio was the author of Iggerot uteshuvot (“Letters and Responsa”), published within Issacar Eilenburg's Be’er sheva (Venice, 1614). As rabbi in Pisa, he wrote Giddulei Terumah (1643), a commentary on Shmu’el haSardi's Sefer Haterumot. A compilation of 75 Sabbath and holiday sermons that he delivered in Venice was published under the title Binah Le’ittim (1647–1648), a work which remains popular to this day, particular among Mizraẖi Jews.Piccio had two sons, Lazzaro and Efrem, who together wrote a commentary on Yeruẖam ben Meshullam’s Toldot Adam veHavva. Both Piccio’s sons died during the 1629–31 Italian plague. Piccio died in Rovigo on 5 or 6 February 1647 and was buried there. He is considered to have been “one of the last great talmudists produced by Italian Jewry”.   "

"Sarra Copia Sullam (1592–1641) was an Italian poet and writer who lived in Italy in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. [SEP] She was Jewish and very well educated. Despite being married, for many years she had what appears to have been an extremely close relationship, by correspondence only, with a writer, Ansaldo Cebà, whom she admired but whom she never actually met. He was a Christian, and at that point in his life he had become a monk. He appears to have fallen in love with Sarra, and constantly urged her to convert to Christianity, but she resisted. In 1621, Sarra was accused of a serious crime of belief, a heresy, and was in danger of trial by Inquisition. She received almost no support from many of her friends, including Cebà. She died of natural causes in 1641. Of her writings, a number of her sonnets and her Manifesto (a response to the accusation of heresy) are all that have survived to the present day.    Sarra was born in Venice in 1592 to a Jewish family. Her parents, Simon and Ricca Copia, had two more daughters, Rachel and Esther.  Sarra was given a basic education in both Jewish and Italian cultures, and learned several languages including Ancient Greek, Latin and Hebrew. In her poetry, Sarra demonstrated her knowledge of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, as well as her familiarity with the works of Aristotle and Josephus. She started writing poetry in Italian at a young age and continued for the rest of her life. As an adult she married Jacob Sullam. She and her husband loved the arts, and invited to their home both Christian and Jewish writers, poets, intellectuals, artists, and clerics. She was described as a woman who ""revelled  in the realm of beauty, and crystallized her enthusiasm in graceful, sweet, maidenly verses. Young, lovely, of generous impulses and keen intellectual powers, her ambition set upon lofty attainments, a favorite of the muses, Sarra Copia charmed youth and age.""    In 1618, Sarra read the book L’Ester, a drama written by an author called Ansaldo Cebà. Twenty seven years her senior, Ansaldo Cebà had been a diplomat when he was younger, but had decided to spend the rest of his life living as a monk. He had gone on retreat in one of Genoa's monasteries. Cebà's book made a great impression on Sarra, and so she wrote a letter to him. In the letter she admitted that she carried the book with her all the time, and even slept with it. Cebà responded to Sarra's letter, and this was the start of four years of letters, gifts and poems, exchanged between the two. Ansaldo Cebà wrote to Sarra that he wanted to help her convert to Christianity. He was aware of how beautiful Sarra was, because his servant, whom he sent with presents for her, had told him so. And on one occasion Sarra sent Cebà her portrait, writing: ""This is the picture of one who carries yours deeply graven on her heart, and, with finger pointing to her bosom, tells the world: ""Here dwells my idol, bow before him.""""Eventually Ansaldo's desire to convert Sarra to Christianity became something more significant: it seems he fell in love with her, a love that was not necessarily just platonic. Their correspondence became more intimate, with some physical allusions and some sexual implications. It was as if they both were playing a game of love, although nothing was ever completely spelled out. Ansaldo wrote to Sarra that if she would convert to Christianity, after death they would be united in Heaven.Sarra's name was originally spelled ""Coppia"" meaning ""pair"" or ""couple"", and in one of Cebà's letters to her, he said that the two letter ""p""s in her name were an indication that the two of them could indeed become a couple, despite the fact that he was a Catholic monk and she was married. After that, Sarra started spelling her name with a single ""p"": Copia. All the way to the end of their correspondence, Cebà tried to convert Sarra; this became the greatest desire of a man who was getting older and whose health was now failing. However, Sarra never submitted to his wish. She did however give Ansaldo permission to pray for her conversion to Christianity, and in return he allowed her to pray for his conversion to Judaism. Sarra and Ansaldo never actually met.In 1623, Cebà published 53 letters that he had written to Sarra. Sarra's letters to Cebà  were never published, and are lost.    Baldassarre Bonifacio was a prominent Christian cleric who had been a guest at Sarra and her husband's receptions. In 1621, he wrote a treatise Immortalità dell’anima (On the Immortality of the Soul). According to Bonifacio's account, two years before that, Sarra had caused him to realize that she did not believe in the immortality of the soul. This was a very serious accusation of a crime of belief which could have resulted in a trial by inquisition.In response, Sarra wrote a work entitled, Manifesto di Sarra Copia Sulam hebrea Nel quale è da lei riprovate, e detestata l’opinione negante l’Immortalità dell’Anima, falsemente attribuitale da SIG. BALDASSARE BONIFACIO, translation: The Manifesto of Sarra Copia Sulam, a Jewish woman, in which she refutes and disavows the opinion denying immortality of the soul, falsely attributed to her by Signor Baldassare Bonifacio. The Manifesto was dedicated to her beloved father, who died when she was 16 years old. In this work she defended her points of view, and attacked Bonifacio.At the beginning of her response to Bonifacio's accusation was the following poem:  O Lord, Thou know'st my inmost hope and  thought,Thou know'st whene'er before Thy judgment throne  I shed salt tears, and uttered many a moan.  Twas not for vanities that I besought.  O turn on me Thy look with mercy fraught,  And see how envious malice makes me groan!  The pall upon my heart by error thrown,  Remove; illume me with Thy radiant thought.  At truth let not the wicked scorner mock,  O Thou, that breath'dst in me a spark divine.  The lying tongue's deceit with silence blight,  Protect me from its venom, Thou, my Rock,  And show the spiteful sland'rer by this sign  That Thou dost shield me with Thy endless might Sarra sent a copy of the Manifesto to Cebà, but he responded to her only after a few months delay, and instead of offering her help, he once again urged her to convert to Christianity. This was the last letter that Cebà, who died soon after, wrote to Sarra.Many of her friends and teachers stopped supporting her during her time of need. Not until 1625 did an anonymous author publish papers in her defense.Sarra died in February 1641, after a three-month illness.   "
"Tintoretto ( TIN-tə-RET-oh, Italian: [tintoˈretto], Venetian: [tiŋtoˈɾeto]; born Jacopo Robusti; late September or early October 1518 – 31 May 1594) was an Italian painter and a notable exponent of the  Venetian school. [SEP] His contemporaries both admired and criticized the speed with which he painted, and the unprecedented boldness of his brushwork. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso (""The Furious""). His work is characterised by his muscular figures, dramatic gestures and bold use of perspective, in the Mannerist style.        Tintoretto was born in Venice in 1518, as the eldest of 21 children.  His father, Giovanni, was a dyer, or tintore; hence the son got the nickname of Tintoretto, ""little dyer"", or ""dyer's boy"". The family was believed to have originated from Brescia, in Lombardy, then part of the Republic of Venice. Older studies gave the Tuscan town of Lucca as the origin of the family. Little is known of Tintoretto's childhood or training. According to his early biographers Carlo Ridolfi (1642) and Marco Boschini (1660), his only formal apprenticeship was in the studio of Titian, who angrily dismissed him after only a few days—either out of jealousy of so promising a student (in Ridolfi's account) or because of a personality clash (in Boschini's version). From this time forward the relationship between the two artists remained rancorous, despite Tintoretto's continued admiration for Titian. For his part, Titian actively disparaged Tintoretto, as did his adherents.  Tintoretto sought no further teaching, but studied on his own account with laborious zeal. He lived poorly, collecting casts, bas-reliefs etc., and practicing with their aid. His noble conception of art and his high personal ambition were both evidenced in the inscription which he placed over his studio Il disegno di Michelangelo ed il colorito di Tiziano (""Michelangelo's drawing and Titian's color"").He studied more especially from models of Michelangelo's Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night, and became expert in modelling in wax and clay method (practiced likewise by Titian) which afterwards stood him in good stead in working out the arrangement of his pictures. The models were sometimes taken from dead subjects dissected or studied in anatomy schools; some were draped, others nude, and Tintoretto was to suspend them in a wooden or cardboard box, with an aperture for a candle. Now and afterwards he very frequently worked by night as well as by day.   "
"Isabella Piccini (born Elisabetta Piccini) was an Italian artist and nun. [SEP] She worked in the mediums of etching, engraving, and illustration.    Piccini was born in Venice in 1644. Her father was etcher and engraver Guglielmo Piccini. He trained Piccini in engraving and illustration in the style of the great masters such as Peter Paul Rubens and Titian. Piccini became a Franciscan nun in 1666, joining the Convent of Santa Croce. Upon joining, she changed her name to Sister Isabella.Prominent Italians commissioned works from her, including portraits and religious artworks. Giovanni Antonio Remondini distributed her prints throughout Europe. All income she made was split between her convent and her family.

Reportedly, she attempted to influence Safiye Sultan (and through her the sultan) to a policy in favour of the Republic of Venice, and by doing so came in conflict with Esperanza Malchi, who had the opposite intention: the two women once came in to open conflict in front of Safiye.

"Pasquale Cicogna was the Doge of Venice from 1585 to 1595. [SEP]  He supported the claim of Henry of Navarre to the French throne, and convinced Pope Sixtus V to support Henry in exchange for his conversion to Catholicism. He broke with tradition by scattering silver coins, rather than gold ducats, to the crowd during his coronation procession. These coins were known from then on as cicognini.  As his reign of Doge continued his popularity increased because he was very diplomatic and able to tackle major problems with great success. Arguably, one of his greatest successes was converting the Rialto Bridge, one of Venice's major landmarks and the only bridge over the Grand Canal of Venice, from wood to stone between 1588 and 1591.  Although greater names such as Michelangelo had submitted designs, Pasquale chose the more humble architect Antonio da Ponte and his nephew Antonio Contin to design and rebuild the Rialto Bridge.  After Pasquale Cicogna died of a fever in 1595 a memorial was in scribed on the bridge to the Doge. His dogaressa was Laura Morozini.   "

"For the cardinal of the same name, see Marino Grimani. [SEP]  Marino Grimani (Venice, 1 July 1532 – Venice, 25 December 1605) was the 89th Doge of Venice, reigning from 26 April 1595 until his death.  Grimani's reign as doge was principally remembered for two reasons:  the splendid celebrations for the coronation of his wife, Morosina Morosini; and the beginning of the quarrel with the papacy that resulted in Pope Paul V placing the Republic of Venice under papal interdict in the reign of Grimani's successor, Leonardo Donato (1606–1607).    Grimani was born in 1532 to Donata Pisani and Girolamo Grimani.  Grimani's father was a wealthy man and an able politician.  Given his wealthy background, Marino Grimani became podestà at a relatively young age, and was then appointed as Venice's Ambassador to the Vatican in Rome.  Upon his return to Venice, he was made a cavaliere.  He became active in city politics and used his immense wealth to gain the acclaim of the people.    Following the death of Pasquale Cicogna, Grimani was a candidate for Doge.  After 70 ballots, none of the candidates had the votes necessary to be elected.  At this point, Grimani made liberal use of ""gifts"" in order to break the deadlock, and he was eventually elected Doge on 26 April 1595. Given Grimani's popularity with the people, his election set off a long round of festivities and celebrations, and, just as these were waning, the coronation of Morosina Morosini as dogaressa set off a new round of opulent festivities. Between 1601 and 1604, Venice, under Grimani's leadership, passed a number of laws limiting the power of the papacy within the Republic of Venice and withdrew a number of clerical privileges.  This came to a head in late 1605 when Venice charged two priests as common criminals, thus denying their clerical immunity from facing charges in secular courts.  On 10 December 1605, Pope Paul V sent a formal protest to Venice. Grimani died on 25 December 1605, leaving the dispute with the papacy unresolved.   "

"Leonardo Loredan or Loredano (16 November 1436 – 22 June 1521) of the Loredan family was the 75th doge of the Venetian Republic from 1501 until his death. [SEP] His dogeship was one of the most important in the history of Venice.    After having studied literature, Leonardo Loredan commenced his political ascent at the age of nineteen when he became a lawyer in the “Giudici di Petizion” - magistracy concerned mainly with financial scandals and bankruptcies. A few years later, Leonardo sat on the “Collegio dei Savi” where he was responsible for assessing and evaluating foreign policy matters prior to their examination in Senate. Shortly after, Leonardo became the “Podestà” in the city of Padua – the Venetian equivalent of a governor ruling in the cities belonging to the Republic. In 1492, Leonardo Loredan was elected as the Procurator of San Mark's, a prestigious position that helped the future doge gain important political influence.Loredan's wife was Giustina Giustiniani (d. 1500). Some historians claim his election as Doge in October 1501 was not entirely due to his talent as a politician but rather because his wife came from a very influential family.        At the time of his accession to the dogeship, Venice was engaged in the second Ottoman–Venetian War, which started in 1499. Loredan had lost his cousin Andrea, a naval officer in the disastrous Battle of Zonchio, and the war had proceeded badly on land too, with the Venetians losing considerable territory. This included the strategic city of Modon, which was the site of a bloody battle involving hand-to-hand combat, followed by the beheading of hundreds of Venetians following the Turkish victory. The war took a heavy toll on the Venetian economy and in 1502–1503 Loredan agreed a peace treaty with the Turks. He was helped in the negotiations by Andrea Gritti, a Venetian who had been conducting trade in Constantinople and would later become doge of Venice himself. Venice paid a high price for this treaty including loss of land and a requirement to pay an annual tribute to the Turks.     Upon the death of Pope Alexander VI in 1503, Venice occupied several territories in the northern Papal States. When Julius II was elected as Alexander's eventual successor, the Venetians expected their seizure of papal territory to be tacitly accepted, as Julius had been nicknamed Il Veneziano for his pro-Venetian sympathies. But instead the new Pope excommunicated the Republic and demanded the land be returned. The Republic of Venice, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over these port cities along the Adriatic coast and willing to pay Julius II an annual tribute, refused to surrender the cities themselves. In 1508, Julius formed an alliance called the League of Cambrai, uniting the Papal States with France, the Holy Roman Empire and several other Christian states.The Doge's problems did not end in Europe. In 1509, the Battle of Diu took place, in India, where the Portuguese fleet defeated an Ottoman and Mameluk fleet, which had been transferred from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea with Venetian help. The defeat marked the end of the profitable Spice trade, which was bought by Venetians from the Mameluks in Egypt and in turn monopolised its sale in Europe, reaping great revenues from it. After losing to the league's forces at the Battle of Agnadello, Venice found its holdings in Italy shrinking drastically. Soon Padua, Venice's most strategically vital Terraferma holding, had fallen, and Venice itself was threatened. Loredan united the population, calling for sacrifice and total mobilisation. Padua was retaken, though Venice was still forced to accept a reluctant peace, following which it joined the Pope as only a junior ally in his new war against the French. The alliance was on the verge of victory, but a dispute arose over territory. Emperor Maximilian refused to surrender any Imperial territory, which in his eyes included most of the Veneto, to the Republic; to this end, he signed an agreement with the Pope to exclude Venice entirely from the final partition.  When the Republic objected, Julius threatened to reform the League of Cambrai. In response, Venice turned to Louis; on 23 March 1513, a treaty pledging to divide all of northern Italy between France and the Republic was signed at Blois. Under this alliance with the French King Louis XII, the Venetians achieved a decisive victory over the Papal states, and were able to secure back all the territories they had lost. In addition, the Papacy was forced to repay many outstanding debts to the Loredan family totaling approximately 500,000 Ducats, an enormous sum of money.     Giovanni Bellini's portrait of Loredan is notable for being one of the first frontal portraits of a reigning doge; throughout the Middle Ages, mortal men had been portrayed in profile, while the frontal view had been reserved for more sacred subjects. Bellini's portrait was painted in 1501–02, and hangs in the National Gallery, London.Over two centuries later, when Pompeo Batoni was given a detailed programme for his large Triumph of Venice (1737) by the Odescalchi cardinal who commissioned it, Loredan was chosen to represent the office of Doge, standing amid a group of allegorical personifications.

"There were three Doges, and many other prominent Venetians, called Alvise Mocenigo. [SEP] Alvise I Mocenigo (26 October 1507 – 4 June 1577) was doge of Venice from 1570 to 1577. An admirer of antiquities, Mocenigo  was a diplomat of the Republic of Venice at the court of emperor Charles V (1545), to pope Paul IV (1557) and again at the imperial court (1564). In 1567 he was a candidate to the election as doge, but lost to Pietro Loredan. He participated again when the latter died, and was elected as doge of Venice in 1570. His dogaressa was the scholar Loredana Marcello (d. 1572).At the time of his accession, the Ottoman Empire was preparing to wage war against Venice: the conflict broke out in 1570, and Venice lost  the fortresses of Nicosia and Famagusta in Cyprus. Despite the victory of the Christian coalition in the Battle of Lepanto, Venice was forced to sign an unfavorable treaty of peace with the Turks (7 March 1573), by which it recognized the loss of Cyprus. During his reign Venice was visited by the new King of France, Henry III, in July 1574.  It was believed that Mocenigo was severely depressed towards the end of his life. He would be seen talking to the children of Venice, however with adults he would not.    Alvise I Mocenigo died on November 27, 1577 of suicide by hanging.

"Nicolò da Ponte (15 January 1491 – 30 July 1585) was the eighty seventh Doge of Venice from 1578 to 1585. [SEP] He reigned in a fairly quiet period.    Da Ponte was born in Sant’Agnese in Venice to the patrician Antonio da Ponte and his wife Regina Spandolino, who was originally from Constantinople. The da Pontes had just gone through a period of severe financial difficulties after the Ottoman conquest of Negroponte, where it owned considerable property, but the marriage of his father with a Greek suggests that he still maintained business interests in the East. Despite these difficulties da Ponte received an excellent education, training with the famous Ignazio Danti and studying philosophy at the University of Padua. But he did not finish his studies, perhaps because of the outbreak of the War of the League of Cambrai. He received a doctorate in medicine in Venice (1514). Like all young Venetian aristocrats, he began a promising cursus honorum (having significant physical and intellectual gifts) that saw him elected to the Collegio dei Savi, but he suddenly cut this career short. It seems that in the twenty years between 1512 and 1530 he was engaged in trade and was so successful that he was able to build a sumptuous palace in San Maurizio and amass a fortune estimated at 150,000 ducats. At the same time he successfully cultivated cultural interests. In 1521 he replaced Sebastian Foscarini for two years as a lecturer in philosophy at the School of Rialto. In 1520 he married Arcangela Alvise Canal, with whom he had two children, Antonio and Pauline. His son predeceased him in 1558, and when Nicolò died he left his property to his nephew, also named Nicolò. The latter died in 1590 without heirs, leaving this branch of the Da Ponte extinct.    In 1570 da Ponte became a Procurator of San Marco, and on 3 March 1578, he was elected as Doge in a long and conflict-ridden election that required 44 ballots. Although he was in his late 80s when elected Doge, he had a very active reign that lasted more than seven years. Young politicians looked to him during the internal crisis of 1581-82 that led to the reform of the Council of Ten. On several occasions he distinguished himself for his anti-clericalism. He died in July 1585 at age 94. (The above is a translation of the article on Italian Wikipedia.)   "

His grandfather was Marco Antonio Bragadin, famous for having been flayed alive after the Ottoman conquest of Famagusta in 1571. His father, Antonio, had been one of the leaders of the Council of Ten in 1607.Marcantonio completed his studies earning a doctorate in utroque iure. He initially took the political career in the Republic of Venice, but already in 1624 moved to Rome and became an ecclesiastic: on 28 September 1626 he was ordained priest. He took up a career in the administration of the Papal States: on 17 March 1627 he became referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature, in April to December 1627 he was governor of Fabriano, then in 1628 governor of Sabina and later of Narni.On 3 December 1630 Bragadin was appointed Bishop of Crema, which was a Venetian inland province. The episcopal consecration followed on 21 December in the Sistine Chapel by the hands of Antonio Marcello Barberini. Already on 12 January 1633 Bragadin was moved to the Diocese of Ceneda, nearer to Venice. In Ceneda he succeeded to keep exempt the town from the taxation over the near Treviso, and in 1634 he issued a ban prohibiting the insults to the Jews during the processions.On 3 October 1639 he was promoted bishop of Vicenza. On 16 December 1641 he was created Cardinal priest with the title of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, which was later, on 19 November 1646, modified in the title of San Marco, the usual title of the most prominent Venetian Cardinal in Rome.

A few months after the Papal conclave, 1655, he resigned as bishop of Vicenza in order to stay in Rome to support the politic of the Republic of Venice, of which he always remained a loyal servant. In particular during the Fifth Ottoman-Venetian War he persuaded the Pope to exhort various Western European nations to send men, ships and supplies to defend Crete. In exchange to this effort the Pope requested and obtained, due to mediation of Bragadin, the re-admission in 1657 of the Jesuits in Venice from where they had been expelled in 1606 for effect of the Venetian Interdict. Marcantonio Bragadin died in Rome on 28 March 1658 and was buried in the Basilica di San Marco.    Catholic Church in Italy   "
"Luca Carlevarijs or Carlevaris (20 January 1663 – 12 February 1730) was an Italian painter and engraver working mainly in Venice. [SEP]  He pioneered the genre of the cityscapes (vedute) of Venice, a genre that was later widely followed by artists such as Canaletto and Francesco Guardi.    Carlevarijs was born in Udine.  He was also known as 'Luca Casanobrio' or 'Luca di Ca Zenobri', for his patronage by the latter family.  He worked principally in Venice, where he also died. His daughter,  Marianna Carlevarijs (1703 - 1750) learned the art of pastel portraiture from Rosalba Carriera.Carlevarijs visited Rome.  Here he was influenced by the Dutch painter Caspar van Wittel (often called Vanvitelli), who was a long-term resident of Rome. Van Wittel was the pioneer of the genre of vedute of Rome. Carlevarijs then started to create vedute of Venice, which  are among the earliest Baroque depictions of the city. He painted landscapes, sea-pieces and perspective views. His works included cityscapes with a topological interest as well as imaginary landscapes with ruins.  He completed over a hundred etchings of views in Venice, which give an exact representation of the principal places in that city.The painters Canaletto, Francesco Guardi and Antonio Visentini are said to have been influenced by his work or even have been his pupils. His paintings and his set of 104 etched views of Venice, which were published in 1703, were the foundation on which Canaletto and Guardi built. Johan Richter collaborated with him. He also collaborated with specialist figure painters who added the staffage into his landscapes or cityscapes.   He worked mostly in Venice.   "

He was a scholar and graduated as a physician from the University of Padua.    In 1700 Cohen published in Venice his Derashot 'al ha-Torah, a common title for homilies (sermons) and commentary on the Pentateuch (Torah). His Derashot 'al ha-Torah is also known as Kebod Chacamim or Kevod Ḥakhamim (The Glory of Wise Men).  In 1719 he published in Venice his Kehunnat Abraham ( ), a book of religious poems in Hebrew written in the manner of and inspired by the Psalms (Tehillim). Cohen used a number of different meters in his poetry. His Kehunnat Abraham created a stir within the Jewish community of the Venetian Republic and other parts of Italy, full of compliments. Joseph Fiametta published a poem in praise of it, as did Issac Vita Cantarini and Shabbethai Marini, both in the mode of the times, sonnet form. Cohen's engraved self-portrait appears on the fly-leaf of his Kehunnat Abraham complete with wig.In 1879 M.

Mrnavić believed that the Illyrians were Slavs. He claimed that Skanderbeg, the national hero of Albania, was of Slav origin, which prompted Frang Bardhi to write a biography on Skanderbeg published in Venice in 1636 as a polemic against him, defending the Albanian identity of Skanderbeg.

[SEP]    Paskvali was a member of noble family from Kotor. Members of this family, who were nobility of Tvrtko I of Bosnia, came to Kotor in 15th century. Ivan Paskvali was born in 1586 and baptised on 22 May 1586. His father was Kristofor de Dominis, son of Grisogon, and his sister was Cecilia.    On 18 August 1641 Paskvali, then a missionary in Dalmatia, reported that his everyday activities included visiting and converting Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism. After Leonardi's death, Paskvali succeeded him in his missionary duties in Montenegro and Serbia, which marked the beginning of large-scale planned activities on Catholicisation of the Orthodox population of this region.In 1643 Paskvali reported that 7,000 ""schismatic"" (Orthodox) and ""heretic"" (Muslim) Serbs live in Montenegro. On 1 December 1645 he wrote a letter to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith and requested four or five Catholic priests to be sent to the coast of Montenegro populated with Orthodox Serbs, for religious conversion purposes. He recommended that those priests first learn to speak Serbian and write using Serbian Cyrillic script.

"Elisabetta Querini (November 12, 1628 in Venice – January 19, 1709 in Venice), was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Silvestro Valier (r. 1694-1700). Querini is described as the only Venetian dogaressa of any significance of the 17th century since Morosina Morosini-Grimani. [SEP] Her consort was said to be known in history mostly through her. Although the Grand Council had, in 1645, abolished the elaborate ceremony for installing a new dogaressa, because of its large expense to the state and to the Doge, Valiero convinced the council to grant an exception.  As such, on March 4, 1694, Elisabetta Querini appeared clad in a cloth of gold robe adorned with sable, with a white veil and corno ducale, (the version of ducal crown worn by the Doge and his wife) adorned with jewels, and a large diamond cross on her chest.  Together Valiero and his wife sat on the throne of Venice and received counselors, ministers, judges, and the capis of the Ten. She also had the traditional Solemn Entry 4 March 1694. She was the last dogaressa to be crowned.

"Nicolò Sagredo (8 December 1606 – 14 August 1676) was the 105th Doge of Venice, reigning from 6 February 1675 until his death less than two years later. [SEP]  Little of note occurred during his reign as Venice was still recovering from the Cretan War (1645–1669), which had ended in the reign of his predecessor.    He was born in Venice, the son of Paola Foscari and Zaccaria Sagredo. Nicolò's career was initially hampered by his father's reputation as a coward.  In May 1630, at the Battle of Valeggio, a part of the War of the Mantuan Succession, the elder Sagredo had deserted in the midst of a battle that saw Venetian forces thoroughly trounced.  His family disgraced, Nicolò was unable to embark on the life of politics he might otherwise have begun at this time. The Sagredo family managed to redeem itself through providing Venice with several heroic deaths during the course of the Cretan War, and meanwhile the family had grown quite rich.  Sagredo was able to parlay his wealth and new-found respect into a series of embassies on behalf of the Most Serene Republic, before eventually becoming a Procurator of St Mark's. Doge Domenico II Contarini died on 26 January 1675.  On 6 February 1675 Sagredo was easily elected as Doge.  He celebrated his election as Doge with festivities and gifts.  Such ceremony was the only notable characteristic of his reign as Doge: in 1675, he celebrated the traditional marriage of Venice with the sea with a level of pomp and ceremony that was long remembered by Venice for its splendor.

"Arcangela Tarabotti (24 February 1604 – 28 February 1652) was a Venetian nun and Early Modern Italian writer. [SEP] Tarabotti wrote texts and corresponded with cultural and political figures for most of her adult life, centering on the issues of forced enclosure, and what she saw as other symptoms and systems of patriarchy and misogyny in her works and discussions.  Tarabotti wrote at least seven works, though only five were published during her lifetime. Because of the politics of Tarabotti’s works, many scholars consider her “a protofeminist writer as well as an early political theorist.”      Sister Arcangela Tarabotti was born Elena Cassandra Tarabotti in Castello, Venice.   Her parents were Stefano Tarabotti and Maria Cadena. One of her siblings was the painter Caterina Tarabotti. Tarabotti was one of eleven children and the eldest of seven daughters.    Tarabotti, like her father, had physical disabilities, which made her feel physically weak and may have contributed to her father’s conclusion that she was unfit for marriage. According to her, at the age of 11 (in 1617), Tarabotti was sent as a boarder to the Benedictine convent of Sant’Anna, but the convent papers state her presence only from 1617 onwards "" Such monachization—especially of daughters deemed “unmarriageable”—was common in Early Modern Europe; this practice, especially when forced or coerced, formed the thematic center of her critical works. The Chiesa di Sant'Anna still stands in the Castello district of Venice, although the inside of the building is currently inaccessible, boarded up and padlocked.  In 1620, Tarabotti took her first vows and, in 1623, she took her final vows rendering her monastic status permanent. At least during her earlier years in the cloister, Tarabotti was said to have been rebellious and outspoken; Tarabotti tells she wore the religious habit in a worldly way or cut her hair until directly ordered to do so by Catholic Cardinal and Patriarch of Venice, Federico Baldissera Bartolomeo Corner or Cornaro. Her beliefs, however, remained unchanged; Tarabotti wrote in her autobiography, explaining that ""He made me amend my vanities. I cut off my hair, but I did not uproot my emotions. I reformed my life, but my thoughts flourish rampantly, and just like my shorn hair, grow all the more."" Indeed, though Tarabotti remained less outwardly rebellious after this time, she wrote that, by living as a nun, she was ""living a lie.""Nuns at this time lived under strict enclosure and separately from lay society, and were prohibited by Canon Law from interacting with people outside of the cloister. Enclosed as she was, Tarabotti managed to educate herself, reading and writing a great deal of prohibited books during her years in the convent; not only that, Tarabotti also managed to circulate her works among peers through correspondence, and appears to have had many visits from outsiders—all of which contact and correspondence were in direct disobedience of Church officials.During her time in the cloister, Tarabotti appears to have educated herself and created an impressive network of correspondents, including various writers, scientists, and political figures. Tarabotti used this network to engage in critical political and literary discourse with cultural and political figures, and to help in the editing and publishing of five texts during her lifetime (and, Paternal Tyranny, her most prized work, two years after her death). Though sometimes cloistered women had opportunities to educate themselves and sometimes had access to books and writing materials, Tarabotti's level of education seemed unique even among this group of women—indeed, some historians have remarked that despite her handwriting  was not ""well above average."", her culture and skills were. Most unusual though, may have been Tarabotti's radical politics and connections to influential literary and political communities. Her works incorporate a profound critique of the Catholic Church's increasing limitation treatment of its female agents in the 17th century. She particularly highlights the role of education and the disparities between male and female opportunities for schooling. Her argumentation remains thoroughly grounded in biblical evidence, highlighting the prominence of female disciples in Jesus Christ's following given the patriarchal context of first-century Judaism, and consequently arguing that women should have a more significant role in the contemporary church and world.    Some historians argue that Tarabotti's published Letters reveal a ""wide-ranging and powerful set of correspondents that included leading cultural and political figures from throughout Northern Italy and into France."" Indeed, Tarabotti corresponded with a range of people, from subversive scientists to well known writers. Tarabotti was the only woman writer in Venice ever documented to have a relationship and correspondences with—as well as enjoy the patronage of—Giovanni Francesco Loredan, founder of the Incogniti literary society, and boasts in her Letters of correspondence with many other members of the Venetian elite. Tarabotti also corresponded and exchanged her work with Francesco Pona, a subversive author of various erotic novels and deliberately anticlerical works; with father Angelico Aprosio, an elite  scholar from Ventimiglia; with a ""fugitive Carthusian monk"" whose works also criticized forced monachization and mistreatment of women in the cloister; with Giovanni Francesco Busenello, a successful Italian lawyer, a prolific poet, and an acclaimed librettist; and with Count Pier Paolo Bissari of Vicenza, another writer whose works range from prose, to poetry, to libretti.  Possibly after Tarabotti's Letters was published, she began a correspondence with Ismaël Bullialdus, a prominent astronomer and mathematician, whom she had met when he was in Venice visiting the French Ambassador and his wife in 1645-1646. Her letters situate Tarabotti in a scholarly community of writers, scientists, and other important political and cultural figures, wherein her presence as a woman was unique and hard won. Her published correspondence also made clear her unyielding resolve to circulate her works and spread her political messages. Indeed, especially in the case of Paternal Tyranny—the text that many historians say was her most prized and maybe most politically subversive work—Letters reveals an ongoing, highly strategic, and often disappointing if impressive saga of requests for patronage and editorial help.    Tarabotti's open criticisms of the coerced monachization of women, misogyny, and other facets of patriarchal systems made her a unique political writer. Not only was the content of Tarabotti's written work unique, but so too was the style of her writing—Tarabotti's mode of writing melded autobiography, fictional account, literary critique, political manifesto, invective, and hermeneutics, to create powerful works that forwarded a provocative protofeminist politics.Paternal Tyranny, widely considered Tarabotti's most prized work, lays bare her radical politics. Lynn Lara Westwater, a historian who has researched and written much on Tarabotti’s life and works calls Paternal Tyranny ""scathing and deeply subversive.""  Paternal Tyranny was indeed subversive, and was received as such: in 1654, the year it was published, the Congregation of the Index attempted to get it placed on the Index of Prohibited Books —and, thus, effectively banned. Paternal Tyranny was eventually placed on the Index in 1661.Paternal Tyranny is organized into three sections or ""books"", the unifying theme of which is the structures of power—from state and governmental hierarchies, to hierarchies within the church, to gender hierarchies—that ensure the subjugation of women, especially through forcing women into the cloister and denying them sufficient education.  In Paternal Tyranny, Tarabotti critiques misogynistic narratives in popular European writings, supporting her pro-women messages with texts such as the Bible, Dante’s Divine Comedy, and the works of other Venetian women writers like Lucrezia Marinella . All in all, the text combats what its title asserts: male tyranny.   "
"Cristoforo Vidman (1617 - 30 September 1660) was an Italian Catholic cardinal of German descent. [SEP]    Vidman was born in 1617 in Venice, though his family were originally from Germany; his father was Giovanni Vidman, Count of Ortenburg. He was educated in Venice and obtained a doctorate in utroque iure, both canon and civil law. His family were considered Venetian nobility, having purchased titles and positions from the city of Venice which was keen to raise money to fund their role in the Thirty Years' War.    During the reign of Pope Urban VIII, Vidman became cleric of the Apostolic Chamber and later its auditor, having purchased both positions in an effort to establish himself in Rome.According to contemporary John Bargrave, it was tradition for new popes to retire those who purchased senior clerical positions by elevating them to cardinal. So it was, when Pope Innocent X was elected at the papal conclave of 1644, that Vidman was relieved of his positions to allow the new pope to sell them to prospective young clerks. Vidman, then, was elevated to cardinal in the consistory of 7 October 1647 by Pope Innocent X and was installed as cardinal-deacon at the Church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. Despite his elevation to cardinal, he and his brother, now a count, still delighted, ""in gaming, feasting, comedies, and the company of women"".He was appointed as legate in Urbino in 1651 and participated in the papal conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII.

"Alvise Contarini (24 October 1601 – 15 January 1684) was the 106th Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on 26 August 1676 until his death seven and a half years later. [SEP] He was the eighth and final member of the House of Contarini to serve as Doge of Venice (with the first being Domenico I Contarini, who became Doge in 1043). His reign was largely peaceful, as the Republic of Venice was still recovering from the defeat to the Ottoman Empire in the 1645–69 Cretan War. However, in the last days of Contarini's reign, hostilities with the Ottoman Empire were rekindled once again, and Venice soon entered the Sixth Ottoman-Venetian War, better known as the Morean War (1684–99).    Contarini was born in Venice as the third son of Nicolò Contarini and Elena Michiel; he was a nephew of Francesco Contarini, the 95th Doge of Venice, who had a one-year reign from 1623 to 1624. Alvise Contarini never married, dedicating his whole life to public service. He served as Venice's ambassador to the Kingdom of France, Spain, the Dutch Republic, and to the Papal court. The King of France granted Contarini the title of chevalier. During his time as savio, Contarini supported the party in the Great Council that called for a continuation of the war with the Ottoman Empire. Upon the death of Nicolò Sagredo on 14 August 1676, it seemed a foregone conclusion that he would be succeeded as Doge by his popular brother Giovanni Sagredo. Giovanni Sagredo quickly secured the votes of thirty of the forty electors. His opponents, however, believed he had used fraudulent means to do so, and they therefore rioted. Alarmed, the Great Council chose forty new electors, and when these electors met on 26 August 1676, they decided on Alvise Contarini as a compromise candidate. Most of Contarini's reign as Doge was occupied with festivities and fun, and he made little attempt to exercise strong dogal powers. Contarini did, however, oversee a major judicial reform in the early part of his reign. Also, many new relics were brought in from Crete (now under Ottoman control) and installed in Venetian churches during Contarini's reign. Several notable firsts occurred in Contarini's reign. On 25 June 1678, Venetian mathematician Elena Cornaro Piscopia became the first woman in the world to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree, from the University of Padua. In a first of a very different sort, Venice's first coffeehouse opened in 1683, and drinking coffee soon became immensely popular. In terms of foreign policy, these were anxious years for Venice. Venetians watched the progress of the Great Turkish War closely, as Venice's enemy, the Ottoman Empire, made territorial gains in the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy (including all of the Balkans by 1682) before finally being halted by the forces of John III Sobieski at the Battle of Vienna on 12 September 1683. In Venice, debates about entering the war on the side of the Habsburgs dominated throughout 1683. Contarini died on 15 January 1684, shortly before Venice decided to enter the war in mid-1684, thus beginning the Morean War (1684-99). Alvise Contarini was buried in the Contarini family chapel in the church of San Francesco della Vigna. There is a bust of Alvise Contarini on his tomb.   "
"Carlo Contarini (5 July 1580 – 1 May 1656) was the 100th Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on 27 March 1655 until his death a little over a year later. [SEP]    Carlo Contarini was born in Venice, the son of Elisabetta Morosini and Andrea Contarini; his father died ten days after his birth.  He was thus the heir of a large fortune, as well as the Contarini name, so renown in the history of the Republic of Venice. He was married to Paolina Loredano. In the course of a long and distinguished career, Contarini traversed the cursus honorum of the Venetian Republic, serving as provveditore, savio, rector, and member of the Senate of Venice. In the years immediately prior to his election as Doge, he had almost entirely withdrawn from public life, and he appears to not even have considered becoming a Procurator of San Marco.    Following the death of Doge Francesco Molin on 27 February 1655, electors met to elect his successor in March 1655, but were divided and could not agree on a candidate. They eventually settled on Carlo Contarini as a compromise candidate because he was allied with all factions, and old enough that he was not expected to have a long reign. He was consequently elected on the 68th ballot on 27 March 1655. Contarini's thirteen-month reign did not see any notable events.  As Doge, he sought to reconcile the various factions that divided Venice.  Venice's prolonged war with the Ottoman Empire for possession of Crete continued throughout his entire reign. Perhaps because of the heavy workload of being Doge, Contarini fell ill in early 1656, and, after a series of failed medical treatments, died  in Venice on 1 May 1656.   "
"Domenico II Contarini (Venice, January 28, 1585 – Venice, January 26, 1675) was the 104th Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on October 16, 1659 until his death. [SEP]    Domenico Contarini was the son of Giulio Contarini and Lucrezia Cornaro.  He had one older brother, Angelo, who was born in 1581, and who probably would have become Doge himself, but for his premature death.  Domenico Contarini came from the branch of the Contarini family known as the ""Ronzinetti"", after a nickname given to his ancestor Maffeo Contarini. As a second son, Domenico Contarini did not initially have an active public life.  His older brother Angelo was launched on a prestigious career through the cursus honorum of the Republic of Venice, but Domenico had to make do with a marriage to Pauline Tron.  The couple had one son, Giulio Contarini (1611–1676) (who would eventually rise to the position of procurator of San Marco), and five daughters (Chiara, Maddalena, Laura, and two others who became nuns). Contarini led a quiet and relaxed life, but he did play a role in the life of the city.  He regularly attended the environs of government, always seeking advancement for his elder brother. In 1627–1628, Venice was bitterly divided into factions, one of which was led by Doge Giovanni I Cornaro, who sought to create a power bloc for the Cornaro family in Venice, and the other of which was led by Renier Zeno, one of the Capi of the Council of Ten, who opposed this.  Contarini did not take part in this dispute, and had unkind words for both sides: he criticized the Cornaro faction for attempting to seize power without having the means to do so, and he criticized Zen for his fiery rhetoric, which Contarini saw as disruptive to the state. Although destined by birth to a secondary role, Contarini took naturally to the back rooms of power, and proved just as adept at attending the Senate of Venice as he might have been as a Senator.  Nor was his public life totally non-existent: he was elected to the Council of Ten, even serving as savio of the Council, and in March 1655, he served as Vice-Doge for the period between the death of Doge Francesco Molin and the election of Carlo Contarini. In the meantime, it appeared that his family's ambitions had come to naught.  His brother Angelo had stood for election as Doge in 1646, but lost out to Francesco Molin.  Angelo's death in 1657 appeared to sound the death knell for the family's ambitions: Domenico Contarini was over seventy years old, while his son, Giulio, was still too young to achieve high political office.  It appeared that the work of a generation had been lost.    A widower, Contarini retired to the Val Nogaredo to spend his final years in peace. But then, Doge Giovanni Pesaro died suddenly on September 30, 1659, with no obvious successor.  There were no strong candidates, only three weaklings: Alvise Contarini, Andrea Pisani, and Lorenzo Dolfin.  The electors were split.  According to the custom of the Republic of Venice, the Doge was elected by a group of 41 electors, chosen basically at random.  Unable to settle on one of the candidates, and dissatisfied with the selections available, a compromise was worked out, and, on the eighth ballot, cast on October 16, 1659, 40 votes were cast for Domenico Contarini, breaking the impasse, and recalling Contarini from his retirement. Many noblemen were furious at the election of Contarini.  The Cretan War (1645–1669), an attempt to recapture Crete from the Ottoman Empire, had been ongoing for ten years at this point, and these noblemen believed that a young, martial leader was needed, not a septuagenarian like Contarini.  Yet, throughout the seventeenth century, Venetian electors repeatedly preferred to elect old men as Doge so that the Doge did not grow too powerful: it was feared that a younger, more martial Doge would be likely to expand his power base and move the Most Serene Republic in a more monarchical direction. Although he was surprised by his election, Contarini was happy to accept the post.  He was popular with the people, who felt that he had never been overbearing during his public career.  In spite of his advanced age, Contarini's reign as Doge lasted for sixteen years, and during that time he was able to bring a measure of political stability to Venice after a period which had seen multiple Doges in a short period of time.    In Contarini's first decade as Doge, the war with the Ottoman Empire grew more intense.  The Siege of Candia had been ongoing from 1648, but many Venetians feared that if Candia was lost, this would mean the end of Venetian hegemony over the Mediterranean Sea and the beginning of Ottoman hegemony.  The Senate of Venice therefore vowed that Candia would never be taken.  Thus, the Venetian treasury was depleted, merchant families were ruined, thousands of Venetian men were killed, and yet the siege continued.  Domenico Contarini was widely praised in these years for his poise, and the nobility of his spirit, in carrying on the fight. In the end, however, Venice was no match for the Ottoman Empire.  On September 6, 1669, the provveditore of Candia, Francesco Morosini (appointed by Contarini in 1661, with his appointment renewed in 1667) was forced to sign terms of surrender.  Morosini faced charges of cowardice on his return to Venice, but, after a brief trial, he was cleared of any wrongdoing. In all, the Cretan War cost Venice some 134 million ducats and some 30,000 lives.  In return, it had cost the Ottomans over 80,000 casualties and millions of ducats, all for a campaign that the Ottomans had thought would last only a few months. After the unpleasantness of the Morosini trial (1670), Contarini found some happiness in his later years.  Shortly after the ending of the war, Contarini's grandson Angelo (named after his late brother) married Elena Nani, and the young couple gave birth to a son, Giulio Felice, who was baptized in 1671. Little else of note happened during Contarini's reign.  After many years of war, Venice attempted to re-establish merchant routes and to balance its budget. Contarini spent the last year and a half of his life bedridden, and finally died on January 26, 1675, at the age of 89.   "
"Francesco Contarini (Venice, 28 November 1556 – Venice, 6 December 1624) was the 95th Doge of Venice, reigning from 8 September 1623 until his death fourteen months later. [SEP]    Francesco Contarini was the son of Bertucci Contarini and Laura Dolfin.  Both of his parents died while he was young, leaving him as an orphan who was raised by his two older brothers.  The three brothers had inherited a substantial fortune, and no expense was spared on Francesco Contarini's education. A lover of travel, Contarini was sent on several diplomatic missions, representing the Republic of Venice in many European courts. He was the bailo in Constantinople from 1602 to 1604.  In 1611 Contarini was in England, serving as Venetian ambassador at the court of King James. A man of refined manners, he gained a reputation of always placing the needs of Venice above his own self-interest.    Following the death of Antonio Priuli on 12 August 1623, there was no obvious successor as Doge.  When voting commenced, there was a stalemate.  Francesco Contarini did not particularly want to be Doge, but after 79 ballots had failed to elect a Doge, he was prevailed on to agree to become Doge, and he was elected on 8 September. Little of note happened during Contarini's time as Doge.  As was customary, he participated in the large Venetian festivals.  The Thirty Years' War, which had spilled into the Valtellina in February 1623, went well for Venice, although Contarini did not himself participate in fighting. Contarini was only 67 when elected as Doge, a relatively young age for a position frequently inhabited by octogenarians.  Nevertheless, he became ill 12 months after he became Doge and died six weeks after that.   "
"Nicolò Contarini (26 September 1553 – 2 April 1631), was the 97th Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on 18 January 1630 until his death 15 months later. [SEP]  Contarini was the Doge who presided over Venice during the Italian plague of 1629–1631, which killed one third of Venice's population.    Nicolò Contarini was born in Venice, the son of Giovanna Morosini and Giangabriele Contarini, a man who was not rich, but who nevertheless was familiar with high culture.  Nicolò Contarini became familiar with philosophy and soon gained a reputation for fairness in his conduct of the public administration of the Republic of Venice.  Politically, he was a supporter of Leonardo Donato.  During the factional divisions of Venice between supporters of Giovanni I Cornaro and Renier Zen in late 1629, Contarini was critical of Cornaro, but was never extreme in his opposition, which won him the respect of Cornaro's supporters. Upon the death of Cornaro, a heated debate led to many rounds of balloting as supporters of Cornaro and supporters of Zen were unable to agree on a candidate. Contarini ultimately emerged as the compromise candidate and was elected Doge on 18 January 1630. Contarini's reign began poorly, with Venetian troops, who were participating in the War of the Mantuan Succession, lost a decisive battle at Valeggio in May 1630, a predecessor to the unsatisfying Peace of Regensburg in October 1630. Venice suffered its first outbreak of bubonic plague in June 1630.  The government acted promptly, imposing quarantine on plague victims and burning the corpses, but it was unable to prevent the death of thousands.  In October 1630, at the request of the Signoria, Contarini vowed to construct a church in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary once the plague was over.  Contarini died in Venice   on 2 April 1631, before the cornerstone of this church, Santa Maria della Salute, was laid.   "
"For the cardinal, see Francesco Cornaro (cardinal). Francesco Cornaro or Francesco Corner (Venice, 6 March 1585 – Venice, 5 June 1656) was the 101st Doge of Venice. [SEP]  His reign as Doge was the shortest of any Doge.  He was elected on 17 May 1656 and died only a few weeks later, on 5 June 1656. Francesco Cornaro was the son of Giovanni Cornaro, who was Doge of Venice from 1625 to 1629.  Francesco Cornaro was married to Andriana Priuli, the daughter of Antonio Priuli, who was Doge from 1618 to 1623. Francesco Cornaro had a prestigious political career. Cornaro soured on politics after an incident occurred while he was serving as the Ambassador of the Republic of Venice to the Duke of Savoy.  The Duke became convinced that Cornaro was plotting against him and had Cornaro expelled from the Duchy of Savoy.  After that, Cornaro withdrew from politics and devoted himself to business.  It was widely believed that he would never be elected as Doge.  However, after the death of Carlo Contarini on 1 May 1656 (a reign that lasted barely more than a year), Cornaro was elected Doge on 17 May 1656, only to die a few weeks later on 5 June 1656.  He is buried in the Tolentini.   "
"Giovanni I Corner or Cornaro (Venice, 11 November 1551 – Venice, 23 December 1629) was the 96th Doge of Venice, reigning from 24 January 1625 until his death. [SEP]    He was the son of Marcantonio Cornaro and Cecilia Giustinian. He married Chiara Delfin on 10 February 1578 and the couple had twelve children. He served as capitano of Verona, before winning a spot on the Council of Ten in 1597.  In 1600, he was made podestà of Padua, and in 1603, podestà of Brescia.  In May 1609, he was named Procurator of St Mark's.    Doge Francesco Contarini died on 6 December 1624.  Following a long conclave held on 4 January 1625, the Dogal voters converged on Giovanni Cornaro as their preferred candidate.  Cornaro's children were strongly opposed to Cornaro's selection as Doge because of Venice's prohibition on the children of Doges being appointed to high office in government or in the Church.  Cornaro now attempted to turn the Dogal position to his family's advantage.  In 1626, Pope Urban VIII appointed Cornaro's son Federico Baldissera Bartolomeo Cornaro as a cardinal.  This move was ultimately ratified by the Senate of Venice, but a latter attempt to make Federico Cornaro Bishop of Vicenza, and later, Bishop of Padua, were successfully blocked. In 1627, Renier Zen, a Capi of the Council of Ten, emerged as a vocal critic of Cornaro, accusing him of running Venice for his own family's benefit by, among other things, turning a blind eye to his son Giorgio's trafficking in contraband goods.  On 27 October, Zen caused an uproar at a meeting of the Great Council by accusing the Cornaro family of corruption; although the elections were annulled, he was unable to obtain any further sanctions.  On December 30, Renier Zen was attacked by masked assassins, who were later found to include Giorgio Cornaro, the son of the Doge. Zen grew even more outspoken in his criticism of Cornaro in the wake of Giorgio Cornaro's failed assassination attempt.  Venice now became divided into two factions, a pro-Conaro faction that was pro-papal and backed by the Venetian oligarchs, and a pro-Zen faction that was anti-papal and backed by the poorer nobility (although Zen was probably not the standard bearer for liberty he was sometimes portrayed as in nineteenth-century tragedies).  Rioting broke out between the two factions on 23 July 1628, and for the rest of Cornaro's life, Venice was locked in a civil war.  The Venetian government had basically broken down by late 1628.  Cornaro died on 23 December 1629, with a new war in Montferrat looming.  He and his wife are buried in the Tolentini.   "
"Nicolò Donà or Nicolò Donato (28 January 1539 – 8 May 1618) was the 93rd Doge of Venice, reigning for little more than a month, from his election on 5 April 1618 until his death. [SEP]    The son of Giovanni Donà and Isabetta Morosini, Donato was born in Venice and studied for a time in Padua before going into trade.  He gained a huge fortune, but remained stingy his entire life.  He never married, and ultimately left his fortune to his brother Francesco and nephew Pietro. Donato proved unwilling to spend the vast sums of money required to gain high office in the Republic of Venice.  However, in 1617–1618, the Spanish Ambassador to Venice, Alfonso de la Cueva, 1st Marquis of Bedmar launched a plot to destabilize the Venetian Republic in order to allow Spanish troops to take over Venice.  In the midst of this crisis, the reigning Doge, Giovanni Bembo, died on 16 March 1618. Donato was elected doge on 5 April 1618, probably by paying bribes.  He tried to eliminate his reputation for stinginess by throwing the traditional lavish banquet to celebrate his election, but this proved unavailing when his parents turned a number of his relatives away from the feast in order to save money. He died in Venice 35 days after his election, with the Bedmar Conspiracy still raging.   "
"Francesco Erizzo (Venice, February 18, 1566 – Venice, January 3, 1646) was the 98th Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on April 10, 1631 until his death fifteen years later. [SEP]  His reign is particularly notable because the last year of his reign saw the beginning of a war with the Ottoman Empire for control of Crete that would last for 24 years and dominate the geopolitics of the Mediterranean.    Francesco Erizzo was born into the Erizzo family, a patrician family from Istria.  Although he was not particularly rich (in no small part because he had to cover for the debts of his brother), he nevertheless had a successful career in the service of Venice.  He acted as Venetian ambassador to both Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and Pope Urban VIII.  He also served as provveditore of various Venetian possessions.  Erizzo never married.    Erizzo was elected as Doge of Venice on April 10, 1631, in the midst of the Italian plague of 1629–1631, which killed one third of the population of Venice, including Erizzo's predecessor Nicolò Contarini.  He was elected by a vote of 40–1, although historian Claudio Rendina has pronounced this election fraudulent.  (The only dissenting vote was cast for Renier Zen, the opponent of Giovanni I Cornaro known for his incorruptibility.) In light of the bubonic plague then decimating the city (it would claim 45,000 victims in all), Erizzo's election was not accompanied by the customary festivities.  The plague finally subsided in November 1631.  Erizzo's predecessor, Nicolò Contarini, had taken a vow to build a church in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary once the plague was over, which church was built and named Santa Maria della Salute.  Erizzo now ordered that Venice would celebrate the Feast of the Presentation of Mary (November 21) as the Festa della Madonna della Salute, where the city's officials parade from San Marco to the Salute in the sestiere Dorsoduro for a service in gratitude for deliverance from the plague.  This tradition is still observed in Venice to this day.  The 1630s were a time of relative tranquility for the Republic of Venice.  The Procuratie were expanded (with gambling becoming a popular pastime there), and the Teatro San Cassiano, Europe's first public opera house opened in 1637, with the Teatro San Moisè following in 1640. The tranquility of the era was interrupted briefly by the First War of Castro, in which the Papal States claimed the Duchy of Castro, which was under the control of the Duchy of Parma.  Venice intervened on Parma's side, and in 1644 a peace treaty was signed that saw Castro remain with Parma. In September 1644, the Knights of Malta captured a galleon of Turkish pilgrims bound for Mecca and then sought refuge in Candia (modern Heraklion) on Venetian-controlled Crete.  Ottoman Sultan Ibrahim I blamed Venice for the attack and determined to conquer Crete from Venice.  The war originally went poorly for Venice, which led Erizzo to ask the Senate of Venice to appoint him captain-general, which they did, over the objection of future doge Giovanni Pesaro.  Erizzo began assembling a fleet to sail against the Turks, but, at age 78, his health failed him, and he died only one month after his military appointment, on January 3, 1646.   "
"Marcantonio Giustinian (March 2, 1619 – March 23, 1688) was the 107th Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on January 26, 1684 until his death. [SEP]  Giustiniani was the quintessential Doge of the Republic of Venice, taking little interest in affairs of state.  He had little role in the conduct of the Morean War (1684-1699), which was raging during his time as Doge, though a number of military victories were secured by provveditore Francesco Morosini, who would later be Giustinian's successor as Doge.     Marcantonio Giustinian was born in Venice, the son of Pietro Giustinian and his wife Marina.  From a rich family, in his youth he was given the nickname, Budella d'oro.  A highly cultured man who spoke several languages, Giustinian served as the Most Serene Republic's Ambassador to the Kingdom of France.  While in France, Giustinian used his great oratorical skills to convince France to provide Venice with funds that enabled it to carry on the Cretan War (1645–1669).  Giustinian became a member of the Council of Ten, and held various offices, but never served in the most important positions.  Giustinian never married, or even had sex with a woman, and he liked to boast that he had thereby avoided sin.  He died in Venice.    Following the death of Doge Alvise Contarini on January 15, 1684, Giustinian was elected as Doge on January 26, 1684.  This move surprised some, who believed that Francesco Morosini was elected Doge, but the Council preferred a pliant doge whom they could control, while Morosini was able to lead its military campaigns.  This strategy led to Giustinian's reign being a time of military victories for the Republic, which were exciting for Venetians who had spent decades watching their empire decline, suffering military defeats, engaging in prolonged sieges, and generally being forced to agree to onerous terms in peace treaties.  In 1686 and 1687, Morosini secured several dramatic victories over the Ottoman Empire, conquering Preveza, Kalamata,  Navarino and the island of Santa Maura. Giustinian was a modest man who could not hope to compete with the martial victories of Morosini.  During his reign as Doge, he was content to host banquets and festivals, and he gained a reputation for going to church so often that he was given the nickname of ""St. Zuanino"" or ""the Doge of the Te Deum"".  In his four and a half year reign, all major decisions were left to his advisers, a fact which led some Venetians to criticize him. Giustinian died on March 23, 1688, following a failed surgery.  Later, a humorous poem circulated about the two attending physicians, Ton and Dolfin (whose names translate as tuna and dolphin), claiming that the doge had been killed by two fish.   "
"Francesco Molin or Francesco Da Molin (21 April 1575 – 27 February 1655) was the 99th Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on 20 January 1646 until his death. [SEP]  Molin's reign is notable because of Venice's participation in a prolonged war with the Ottoman Empire over Crete; this war was begun during the reign of Molin's predecessor Francesco Erizzo, and dragged on until 1669.  To fund the cost of this war, Molin sold access to the Venetian patriciate at a cost of 100,000 ducats per person.    The son of Marino Molin and Paola Barbarigo, Francesco Molin was born and died in Venice, and dedicated nearly his entire career to military – and particularly, naval – pursuits.  As such, he served as provveditore of a number of Venetian possessions.  In this, he gained a reputation as a practical and pragmatic man, and one given to diplomacy and compromise.  He was chosen as Procurator of San Marco on his merits; on the outbreak of the Cretan War (1645–1669), he was selected as Captain General of the fleet of the Republic of Venice.  He suffered from gout which rendered him intermittently unable to perform his duties. The Molin family lived at Palazzo Molin, in the San Marco district of Venice.    On 20 January 1646, after 23 ballots and considerable expense, Molin was elected as the 99th Doge of Venice. During his first years as Doge, Molin strengthened Venetian forces in the area around Venice, and in Dalmatia, hoping to be able to carry the fight to Ottoman territory.  Venice saw a number of victories in these years, climaxing with Venice's capture of Klis Fortress, previously believed to be impregnable, although Venice proved unable to turn this to her strategic advantage.  All of Venice's naval victories were met with fresh Ottoman troops, raised from the vast expanse of the Ottoman Empire. In an attempt to improve the situation, Venice led a fleet to the Dardanelles, where more Ottoman ships were destroyed, although a decisive Venetian victory still eluded Molin. In the campaigns of 1654 and 1655, Admiral Lazaro Mocenigo blockaded the Dardanelles; Mocenigo was killed during a third attempt, in 1657. Given Venice's dire straits, it was forced to seek funds wherever it could.  Molin determined to sell access to the Venetian nobility at a price of 100,000 ducats (60,000 ducats as a ""gift"" to the republic, and another 40,000 as a ""loan"").  These sales saw a number of new merchant families become Venetian patricians. Molin died of a calculus on 27 February 1655.   "
"Giovanni Pesaro (September 1, 1589 – September 30, 1659) was the 103rd Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on April 8, 1658 until his death. [SEP] The Cretan War (1645–1669) was ongoing for the entirety of his brief reign.    Giovanni Pesaro was the son of Elena Soranzo and Vettor Pesaro, a rich man. He rose to prominence quickly, being repeatedly elected as ducal councillor, as a member of the Senate of Venice, and then serving as the Republic of Venice's ambassador to the Vatican, prior to serving as Procurator of St Mark's. In spite of all of these honours, his reputation was far from spotless. In 1642, he abandoned the garrison of Pontelagoscuro (a frazione of Ferrara), which he was commanding, in the face of the enemy.  In the years following this incident, he was implicated of embezzlement and abuse of office.  As rector, he appropriated land owned by a citizen for himself.  Following the death of his wife Lucia Barbarigo, Pesaro married his housekeeper, a low born woman whose brother was a criminal banished from the republic.  In spite of these disabilities, Pesaro managed to work his way into the mainstream of Venetian politics.  With the war against the Ottoman Empire at a low point, and many Venetian nobles considering giving up Crete, Pesaro gave an impassioned speech in the Maggior Consiglio (Grand Council) in favour of continuing the war, in the course of which he pledged 6000 ducats of his own money.  This action inspired the other nobles to continue the war.  His militant attitude won him great favour, and, following the death of Doge Bertuccio Valiero on March 29, 1658, Pesaro was the consensus candidate for new Doge of Venice.     On April 8, 1658, Pesaro was elected as Doge on the first ballot, not least because he was considerably younger than his opponents, and it was hoped that he would have a longer reign than had his predecessors, a wish regrettably unfulfilled.  Pesaro was hated by the people of Venice, and fell ill soon after his election as Doge. Pesaro faced a difficult situation on becoming Doge.  The war had displaced Venice's commerce, and Venice was heavily overtaxed to pay for the war. Pesaro died on September 30, 1659, and was buried with great pomp.   "
"Antonio Priuli (10 May 1548 – 12 August 1623) was the 94th Doge of Venice, reigning from 17 May 1618 until his death. [SEP]  Priuli became Doge in the midst of an ongoing Spanish conspiracy orchestrated by the Spanish Ambassador to Venice, Alfonso de la Cueva, 1st Marquis of Bedmar, a ""spy war"" that did not end until 1622.    Priuli was born and died in Venice.  He was the son of Gerolamo Priuli and Elisabetta Cappello.  He enjoyed a successful career as a sailor and a soldier.  He married Elena Barbarigo and the couple had 14 children, which resulted in the need for Priuli to become heavily indebted. In 1618, he was appointed provveditore of Veglia.  Upon the sudden death of Doge Nicolò Donato only 35 days after his election, Priuli was recalled from Veglia to become Doge.    Priuli was hurriedly elected as Doge on 17 May 1618, only days after the death of Donato.  At the time of his election, it was widely believed that the Spanish, led by Bedmar, had landed mercenaries on Venetian territory; that Bedmar had successfully infiltrated the Venetian military; and that a Spanish fleet was poised to take Venice.  Priuli's election began a brutal process of ferreting out individuals suspected of plotting against Venice.  Hundreds were arrested, with or without cause, with attention specially focused on foreign soldiers and sailors.  The manhunt led to the arrest of many actual plotters, but also of many innocent victims, such as Antonio Foscarini, a patrician who was executed on 21 April 1622, after attending an event at the English embassy. The hysteria ended in 1622, and on 16 January 1623 the Venetian government issued an apology to Alethea Talbot for Foscarini's execution, thus marking a scaling back of the manhunt.  Venice and Spain continued to be at odds throughout the seventeenth century, but things never again reached the fever pitch of 1618–1622. In February 1623 the Thirty Years War spilled into Venetian territory, though only in the Valtellina.  Priuli was, however, already too ill to participate, and died not long thereafter, on 12 August 1623.   "
"Bertuccio Valier or Valiero (1 July 1596 in Venice – 29 March 1658 in Venice) was the 102nd Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on 15 June 1656 until his death. [SEP]    Bertuccio Valier was the son of Silvestro Valier and Bianca Priuli. We are not certain how he was educated, but he had a reputation as being cultivated and refine. He married Benedetta Pisani, and the couple had many children together. All of Valier's children predeceased him except for his son Silvestro Valier, who would himself serve as Doge of Venice from 1694 to 1700. He suffered health problems throughout his life. Valier was very wealthy, which allowed him to obtain prestigious posts in Venetian politics and diplomacy. He served as podestà of various towns in Venice's Terraferma, and as Venetian Ambassador to the Vatican during the pontificate of Pope Alexander VII.    Valier became Doge in the midst of a prolonged war with the Ottoman Empire for possession of Crete, which had been ongoing since 1645. Upon the death of Doge Carlo Contarini on 1 May 1656 Valier became a candidate as Doge. On 17 May 1656, however, he lost the election to Francesco Cornaro, who died only nineteen days later. A second election was held on 15 June and Valier was unanimously elected as Doge on the first ballot. He was already in ill health and would be dead less than two years later, meaning Venice, in the midst of its war, would have seen five Doges in the space of four years. During Valier's reign, the Most Serene Republic proposed terms for ending the Cretan War, but these were rejected by the Ottoman Empire. Valier ordered a Venetian fleet to sail through the Dardanelles to attack Istanbul, in the hopes that this would at least relieve the pressure on the Siege of Candia; this expedition had only limited success. Desperate for money with which to fund the war, in 1655, Valier allowed the Jesuits, who had been expelled from the Venetian Republic by Leonardo Donato in 1606, to return in exchange for a cash payment. Venice was desperate for funds, and, despite the fact that Valier contributed 10,000 ducats of his own money, Venice was nearly insolvent. Valier succumbed to sickness on 29 March 1658, aged only 61. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges. His son, Silvestro Valier, was his sole legatee. Silvestro Valier would later have a massive monumental tomb built in the Basilica, and Bertuccio Valier's remains were also placed there. Thus, father and son, and their wives, are buried together.  		   "
"Silvestro Valier or Valiero (Venice, 28 March 1630 – Venice, 7 July 1700) was the 109th Doge of Venice, reigning from his election on 25 February 1694 until his death six years later. [SEP]  The Morean War between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire, which had been ongoing since 1684, came to an end during Valier's reign as Doge, in January 1699.    Silvestro Valier was the son of Bertuccio Valier, who had served as Doge from 1656 to 1658.  On 8 August 1649, in the church of Santa Maria Formosa, Silvestro Valier was married to Elisabetta Querini; Valier was only 19 years old.  Valier then became procurator by purchasing the office.  According to his chroniclers, Valier did not possess any special talents, but he was handsome, and a good speaker.  Throughout his career, he was most interested in the diplomatic affairs of the Most Serene Republic, and where his good looks and way with words proved useful.  Valier was a lover of the good life, but he was also generous to the poor and thereby gained their affections.    Doge Francesco Morosini died on 16 January 1694.  Morosini, a military hero before becoming Doge, had been the rare seventeenth-century Doge of Venice who was active on the battlefield.  However, on his death, with the Republic still embroiled in war and facing massive economic difficulties, Venetians decided to elect someone who was not very ambitious.  They therefore elected Silvestro Valier on 25 February 1694, and he celebrated by paying for lavish celebrations and banquets.  Although the Grand Council had, in 1645, abolished the elaborate ceremony for installing a new dogaressa, because of its large expense to the state and to the Doge, Valier convinced the Council to grant an exception.  As such, on 4 March 1694, Elisabetta Querini appeared clad in a cloth of gold robe adorned with sable, with a white veil and corno ducale, (the version of ducal crown worn by the Doge and his wife) adorned with jewels, and a large diamond cross on her chest.  Together Valier and his wife sat on the throne of Venice and received counselors, ministers, judges, and the capis of the Ten. Venice's war with the Ottoman Empire - the Morean War - was only one part of the Ottoman Empire's struggle against the Holy League of 1684.  On 11 September 1697, Ottoman forces were defeated by troops of the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary at the Battle of Zenta.  This decisive battle led to the Ottoman Empire's determination to end the Great Turkish War, and peace negotiations began at Sremski Karlovci.  These negotiations eventually produced the Treaty of Karlowitz, signed on 26 January 1699 and ending the Great Turkish War, including the Morean War.  Under the Treaty, Venice received the Morea, Aegina, Lefkada, and Zakynthos.  Most Venetians felt they gained far too little territory to compensate for the huge loss of life and expense of the wars with the Ottoman Empire.  The Republic was exhausted by the long war and facing economic distress, but little changed for Valier, and he continued hosting banquets, receptions, and parties at which he entertained persons of rank.   Already sick, Valier's last days were made worse by a series of family disputes.  He died on 7 July 1700. He was buried in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, where twenty-four other doges also found their resting place.

From 1608 to 1617 he served as a courtier in Urbino. From 1617 to 1623 he taught philosophy at Bologna and Padua University. In 1623 he accompanied the apostolic nuncio Innocenzo Massimo on a diplomatic mission to Spain. He returned to Italy in 1625, dying in Bologna in 1630.Zuccolo is remembered as a theorist of reason of state: against Scipione Ammirato, Zuccolo argued that reason of state did not necessarily involve breaking the law, but included any action aiming at conserving a particular form of government. He is also remembered for the attention he gave to utopia in three pieces of writing included in his 1625 Dialogues: 'Aromatario, or the Republic of Utopia'; 'Porto, or the Republic of Evandria'; and 'Belluzzi, or the Happy City'.

"Giovanni Alberto Badoer or Gianalberto Badoaro (12 May 1649 – 17 May 1714) was a Venetian Catholic cardinal who served as Patriarch of Venice and Bishop of Brescia. [SEP]    Giovanni Alberto Badoer was born in Venice on 12 May 1649 of a family of the patrician nobility. He was a nephew of Alberto Badoer, bishop of Crema, who was his teacher from the age of five. It was always the bishop of Crema who started his ecclesiastical career, personally providing him with tonsure, as well as ordering a subdeacon in 1663.In 1673, together with his uncle bishop, he accompanied the new Cardinal Pietro Basadonna to Rome for his investiture cardinal. Returning to Crema, he was appointed archdeacon of the cathedral and abbot commendatore of San Pietro di colle. After the death of his uncle (1677), he moved to Padua where he met the bishop of that town, Saint Gregorio Barbarigo who deeply influenced his Christian life. Badoer was ordained priest by that bishop in 1677. He earned the doctorate in utroque iure from the University of Padua and he was named a Canon of Cathedral of Padua in 1681. In 1684 the Doge of Venice appointed him as Primicerius of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. On 27 Sept 1688 the Venetian Senate elected him as Patriarch of Venice. The episcopal consecration followed on 14 November in the Venetian Church of San Lorenzo by the hands of Gregorio Barbarigo who came specifically to Venice for that ceremony. During his years as a patriarch, he assiduously visited the churches, monasteries and seminaries of his diocese, working for the formation of the clergy. Badoer founded the Conservatory of Santa Maria delle Penitenti reserved for women who had abandoned prostitution.On 7 June 1706 Badoer was transferred by Pope Clement XI to the Diocese of Brescia, because that diocese was subject to some heretic influences coming from North Europe. In the meantime, on 17 May 1706 he was appointed Cardinal priest with the title of San Marcello, which in 1712 he modified to the title of San Marco.He was particularly noted for his opposition to Quietism and had positions near to the ones of the Jesuites. In particular Badoer opposed in Brescia the priest Giuseppe Beccarelli charging him of Quietism and having him condemned by the Ecclesistic Trubunal to seven years for heresy. When the Council of Ten reviewed that process, the punishment was increased to life imprisonment because the Beccarrelli was found guilt also of child sexual abuse.Badoer died in Brescia on 17 May 1714 and he was buried in the New Cathedral of that town.

"Caterina Sagredo Barbarigo (14 July 1715 – 11 February 1772), was a Venetian aristocrat and somewhat notorious salon holder. [SEP]    She was the daughter of Gerardo Sagredo of the aristocratic Sagredo family. She married twice: Antonio Pisaro in 1732, and Gregorio Barbarigo of the aristocratic Barbarigo family in 1739. her only daughter was Contarina Barbarigo. Caterina Sagredo Barbarigo was famous for her beauty and intellectual pursuits, was described as a skillful rider and became known for her travels. She hosted a literary salon counted among the most notable in contemporary Venice, and supported the inoculator Domeniceti.    Caterina Sagredo Barbarigo is also known for her conflict with the Venetian Inquisition.  She operated a popular casino at the Giudecca. Venice become famous for its casinos at this point. The clergy and the Inquisition found these businesses scandalous, because at the casinos, both men and women from the nobility  could mix freely. In prior centuries, women of the Venetian nobility had seldom been allowed to congregate with men, but during the 18th century, this underwent a sharp contrast, a development which started when Chiara, Maddalena and Laura Contarini, daughters of doge Domenico II Contarini, had stopped using the zoccoli, a certain type of shoe used by the Venetian upper class women, which had prevented them from moving freely.  The Inquisition saw the gender mixing at the newly established casinos as a symbol of this, and also banned noblewomen from frequenting them. Caterina was indicted and her casino was closed by order of the Inquisition 6 April 1747.  Her case became famous, but it did not stop the development: already in 1751, another female noble, Marina Sagredo Pisani, opened a new casino, and in 1767 the Inquisition allowed noblewomen to frequent the casinos on the condition that they cover their faces. Caterina Sagredo Barbarigo is the model of several famous paintings of Rosalba Carriera.    Madaluzza Contarini Gradenigo   "

"Caterina Dolfin (Venice, 8 May 1736 -  Venice, 14 November 1793) was an Italian (Venetian) poet. [SEP] Caterina was the daughter of the Nobilhuomo Ser Antonio Giovanni Dolfin and the Nobildonna Donata Salamon, members of a secondary branch of one of the most ancient families of the Venetian aristocracy. Caterina's father was known to have squandered the family fortune, leaving serious debts to his wife and daughter upon his death in 1753. In 1755, the young ""nobildonna"" made a suitable marriage with Marcantonio Tiepolo, a member of another influential noble family which had the means to relieve the Dolfins of their debts. The marriage of Caterina with Marcantonio Tiepolo achieved great notoriety in Venetian society. It is understood that in 1756, only months after her marriage, Caterina entered into a relationship with Andrea Tron, a Statesman, and also member of the aristocracy, although not of the antiquity of the Dolfins. Very shortly after her affair began, Caterina filed for divorce, the matter was subject of great scandal, but its records, preserved until this day, have been of great interest for academics, containing a rich testimony of the rules, customs and social complexity of Venetian aristocracy. After years of scandal, the divorce was granted in 1772, upon which she married Tron, who used his marriage to enter into the innermost circles of society, and stately institutions, achieving the prestigious office of ""Procurator of Saint Mark"", the next most important post to that of Doge. From then on, Caterina Dolfin Tron was known as the ""Procuratessa"". In 1757, Caterina made her debut as a writer under a pseudonym. Her most famous work was a collection of sonnets inspired by her father, which were published in 1767-68. She was a center of a circle of intellectuals and held a prestigious literary salon. Among her guests were Gaspare Gozzi. In several testimonies of her time, Caterina Dolfin was described as a beautiful, kind, cultivated and refined woman, admired for her brilliant conversation, her graceful poetry and prose. She was also an assistant of Gasparo Gozzi. In 1772, Dolfin was famously called before the Venetian Inquisition because of some of the contents of her library, which were reported to have ideas from the Enlightenment. Along with her poetry, famous entertaining and intellectual relevance, Caterina Dolfin never ceased to shock Venetian society with her scandalous affairs. One of her best known lovers was probably the twenty-seven year old Gian Galeazzo Serbelloni, Duke of San Gabrio. According to their correspondence, still extant today, it can be inferred that the affair may have begun in 1773. There was a known occasion when Princess Gonzaga, close friend of Caterina, asked her to her present her to Venetian society during her visit to the city. The Princess had also been the subject of many scandals. When arriving at the Ducal Court, the noble ladies of the Venetian aristocracy refused to speak to her. However, Caterina Dolfin said out loud: ""Ladies, this is Princess Gonzaga, she as I belongs to an illustrious family, as for many of you, I could not say.""In 1778, Andrea Tron, Caterina's husband was elected senator. However, he lost the 1779 election to become Doge of Venice although he was one of the two main candidates. This is partially attributed to the political scandals surrounding Caterina at that time, as was her involvement in the ""Gratarolo Affair"", named after Secretary of State Antonio Gratarolo. The case consisted in a series of courtly intrigues to get the post of Ambassador to the Duchy of Savoy for one of two candidates, one supported by Gratarolo, and the other by Caterina Dolfin. In 1772, Gratarolo defeated Caterina's candidate. In 1775, a theatrical play, supposedly commissioned by Caterina, exposed Gratarolo's intrigues and affairs. In the same year of her husband's candidacy for Doge, Gratarolo answered the insult with another play, which caricatured Dolfin and her social circle, exposing her love affairs and staining her name and reputation publicly. The play destroyed Andrea Tron's chances to become Doge. The victorious candidate turned out to have a spouse even more unsuitable for the title of Dogaressa, Margherita Delmaz, but is reported to have bribed many of the electors to assure her acceptance. Caterina Dolfin was widowed in 1785. She was left a fortune but became entangled in a dispute with her former in-laws. Starting in 1788, she increasingly spent her time at her house in Padua. In her last years, she worked on a project for the reform of female education, which does not appear to have come to fruition before her death.   "
"Angelo Emo (3 January 1731 – 1 March 1792) was a Venetian noble and admiral, mostly known for being the last admiral of the Republic of Venice to lead the Venetian navy to battle. [SEP]  He attempted to introduce reforms based on the practices of the British Royal Navy, and led raids on Moorish targets along the Barbary Coast in retaliation for corsair attacks on Venetian-flagged shipping.       Angelo Emo was born in Venice on 3 January 1731, to a distinguished aristocratic family. His father was Giovanni di Gabriele and his mother was Lucia Lombardo. He was educated at the Jesuit college in Brescia, before returning to Vencie, where which his father chose as his tutors the scholars Giovanni Battista Bilesimo, Jacopo Stellini, and Carlo Lodoli.In 1751 he entered service in the Venetian navy as a nobile di nave (gentleman cadet), going on his first sea voyage in the same year. Already in 1755 he was captain of a warship, distinguishing himself in convoy escort duties against the attacks of pirates. In 1758 he was charged to lead an expedition to the Atlantic Ocean in order to escort home Venetian merchant vessels and conclude a new trade agreement with Portugal. During this mission he encountered a tempest that lasted for two months and confined his ship, the San Carlo, to the coasts; during this storm he narrowly escaped shipwreck and gave proof of his seamanship and command skills, earning universal acclaim on his return to Venice in August 1759.     In 1760 he was Provvedditore della Sanità (health commissioner), but in the next year he was commander of a squadron of one ship of the line and two frigates, sent against the Barbary pirates praying on Venetian shipping. Until 1767 he alternated between anti-piracy commands and public office in Venice. As Savio ed Esecutore alle Acque (water commissioner) in 1761–62, he commissioned a plan of the Venetian Lagoon, which was completed in six months. In 1763 he was elected to the higher command rank of Patron delle Navi (rear admiral of the sailing fleet) and patrolled the Adriatic Sea. In 1765 he was promoted to Almirante (vice admiral of the sailing fleet), and in 1767–68 he forced the Dey of Algiers to conclude a favourable peace treaty with the Republic of Venice. During this campaign, he again narrowly escaped shipwreck due to a storm aboard the 74-gun ship Ercole.On 12 June 1768, he was raised to Capitano delle Navi, full admiral of the sailing fleet. When the Russian fleet under Alexei Orlov arrived in the Mediterranean in 1770 as part of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, Emo led a Venetian squadron to a cruise in the Aegean, to protect Venetian and French subjects and commercial interests in the area. The conflict also saw raids by the Dulcigno pirates, ostensibly acting as subjects of the Sultan, in the Venetian Ionian Islands. Emo sailed against them, but his fleet suffered heavy losses when it was caught by a storm near Cape Matapan on 19 December 1771: half his squadron, the 74-gun ship Corriera and the frigate Tolleranza, foundered, the former with almost all hands; Emo's own flagship, the Ercole, only survived by cutting her masts.In 1772 he departed his naval duties and entered the Venetian Senate. Elected several times as censor, he worked to revive the manufacture of Murano glass. In 1776–1778, as a Savio alle Acque, he was responsible for several maintenance works around the Lagoon, on the Brenta River, the Terraglio road, and the canal of Cava. On 18 July 1778 Emo was again elected Capitano delle Navi, hoisting his flag on the heavy frigate Sirena, to deal with the provocations of the Pashalik of Tripolitania, which tried to exploit the ""right of earch"" accorded to them by treaty on Venetian shipping beyond the agreed-upon limits. Emo led his fleet in a demonstration of force in front of Tripoli, forcing the pasha to conclude a new peace agreement with the Republic. Emo's appointment was renewed for the year after, but no actions took place. In 1779 he was a Savio alla Mercanzia (trade commissioner) he promoted reforms such as the reduction of tax on silk, the opening of new shops at Sebenico, and the transfer of the Venetian consulate in Egypt from Cairo to the port city of Alexandria.In 1780 he was a Provveditore ai Beni Inculti (commissioner on uncultivated lands) and laid out plans for the draining of the Adige marshlands around Verona, a project begun already by Zaccaria Betti. However, once again due to lack of funds, the plans were not carried out. In 1782–1784 he served as director of the Venetian Arsenal (Inquisitore all'Arsenale), which he restored and reformed, beginning construction of new models of ships, imported from England and France, introducing copper sheathing, improved the methods for the manufacture of hawsers and rigging, and increased the salaries of non-noble officers. In 1783 he led the negotiations with the Habsburg envoy Ludwig von Cobenzl on freedom of navigation in Istria and Dalmatia.     On 6 March 1784 he was elected as Capitano Straordinario delle Navi (commander-in-chief of the sailing fleet) against the Beylik of Tunis, which had declared war on the Republic after a Venetian ship laden with goods from the Barbary coast was burned by the authorities in Malta due to it being infected with the plague. On 21 June, Emo sailed from Venice for Corfu at the head of a squadron composed of the ships of the line Fama, Forza, and Palma, the frigates Concordia, Sirena, Brillante, Pallade, and Venere, the xebec Triton, the bombards Distruzione and Polonia, the galiot Esploratore, and the hospital ship Kav. Angelo. The fleet was soon joined by the ship of the line Concordia and the xebecs Cupido and Nettuno, but left Triton behind when it sailed for Tunisia on 12 August.On 1 September 1784, his squadron anchored at Cap Carthage, five miles from Tunis. In a series of expeditions over the next three years, he repeatedly bombarded Sousse (5 October 1784, for three nights in April 1785, and in 26 September–6 October 1787), Biserte (30 May to 10 August 1787), Sfax (15–17 August 1785, and 6, 18, and 22 March 30 April and 4 May 1786), and La Goulette (on 1, 3, 5, 9 October 1758), where he utilized floating batteries of his own invention. These operations not only caused great damage and casualties in these cities, but also confined the Tunisian fleet to its harbours. The Senate rejected his requests of a 10,000-man expeditionary force  with which to assault and capture Tunis, however. Instead, in 1787, the Bey of Tunis was forced to sign a treaty with the Republic of Venice, granting it favourable trade terms: the tax rate for goods carried on Venetian merchant ships fell from 7% to 4%, although for its part the Republic was obliged to pay a lump sum of 40,000 sequins. In the meantime, on 28 May 1786, Emo had been elected Procuratore de Ultra of St Mark's Basilica.The treaty did not last long, however, before the Tunisians resumed their raids. Emo led a squadron to the Aegean against them, but lost two ships in a storm. The government of the Republic confiscated his possessions to repay the lost ships. In late 1790, the Senate named him Provveditore Generale da Mar, but did not entrust him with leading the fleet against the Tunisian coast. With the French Revolution under way in Europe, the Senate was loath to become embroiled in a prolonged conflict, and preferred peace. The Senate feared that Emo's aggressive nature would hamper these efforts, and instead placed the Almirante Tommaso Condulmer, promoted to Capitano delle Navi, in charge of the naval blockade and the peace negotiations. While waiting to join with the rest of the fleet at Malta, Emo died on 1 March 1792, reportedly from a bilious attack after learning that a peace, mostly disadvantageous to Venice, had been concluded with Tunis without his being consulted.Celebrated as a great naval hero, his body was embalmed and carried to Venice on board his flagship, the ship of the line Fama. The sculptor Antonio Canova was charged with erecting a monument to Emo. Completed in 1794, it is in the second armoury of the Venetian Arsenal. Canova was honoured by the Republic with a medal for this monument, the last such medal issued by the Republic before its end. His funeral took place at St Mark's on 17 April, and he was buried at the church of Santa Maria dei Servi. A funerary monument was erected over his tomb by Canova's teacher, Giovanni Ferrari, initially at Santa Maria dei Servi, then moved to San Martino, and finally, from 1817, to San Biagio.    Following the death of his older brother, Alviso Emo, in 1790, Angelo Emo's death also meant the end of the San Simeon Piccolo branch of the Emo family.Already at the time of his death, his loss was seen as a heavy blow and symptom of the Republic's decline. Emo's reputation was enhanced further by 19th-century historians of Venice, keen on romanticizing the final decades of the Republic: Girolamo Dandolo calls him ""the last roar issued by the Lion of St. Mark on the sea"", while for Samuele Romanin he might have been able to ""shake [the Republic] from the disastrous abandonment"" and ""inspire in her the strength and energy"" that she sorely lacked in the final years of its existence. For Romanin, Emo was the last of the great captains of the Venetian navy, and indeed of the Republic, which ""may indeed be said to have herself descended with him into the sepulchre"". After him, the Venetian navy would no longer be called upon to fight.His sudden death also led to rumours that he had been poisoned. Girolamo Dandolo insisted that this was the case, and identified his deputy Tommaso Condulmer, ambitious not only to succeed him, but also to conclude a peace treaty with the Barbary states. This has been convincingly disproved by modern historians.      "

"Gasparo, count Gozzi (4 December 1713 – 26 December 1786) was a Venetian critic and dramatist. [SEP]    Gasparo Gozzi was the first of eleven children born to the Venetian Count Jacopo Antonio and Angela Tiepolo, who was also of noble family. His younger brother was Carlo Gozzi. After early studies at home with tutors, he entered the College of Murano, where he acquired a solid liberal arts education and then followed courses in mathematics and law, although his interests were already firmly turned to literature. In 1739, he married the poet Luisa Bergalli, by whom he was eventually to have five children. In 1747 they undertook the management of the theatre of Sant'Angelo in Venice, with Gozzi supplying the performers with dramas chiefly translated from the French. The idea had been to remedy their precarious financial situation but the theatre lost money and they had to give it up the following year, although he continued his work as a dramatist. Gozzi went on to build a reputation for works of moral seriousness in both prose and verse, in particular the 14 prose Dialoghi dell’isola di Circe (Dialogues from Circe's Island) that were published over the four-year period (1760–64). These drew their inspiration from Giovan Battista Gelli's La Circe dialogues of two centuries earlier. Ulysses has been given leave by Circe to talk to the men on her island that have changed into beasts. These include figures from fable (The fox and the crow, XIII) and from myth and give a picture of society at variance. Far from needing the intervention of Circe, the victims find their natural condition as soon as they set foot on the island. The sole exception is the bear, a satirist who had dared to criticize Circe and had been changed as a punishment (IX). It is this noble critic of the human condition (representing Gozzi himself) who is the only one that wishes to regain his human form. In 1760 Gozzi had launched the Gazzetta Veneta as a Venetian equivalent of the English Spectator, followed by L'Osservatore Veneto. Although neither were particularly successful, he had made himself known as one of the ablest critics and purest and most elegant stylists in Italy. From 1762 he was compensated for the disappointment of his journalistic failure by receiving his first public offices of some importance, first in the University of Padua and then for the Republic. In this role he wrote, among other things, three reports on the state of the art of printing in Venice. The first outlined Venetian publishing history from its origins to the eighteenth century, researching the causes of this decline and proposing remedies, while the others envisaged projects for its successful future development. For a considerable period he was censor of the press in Venice, and in 1774 he was appointed to reorganize the university system at Padua, where he remained till his death.   "

"Giulia Lama (1 October 1681 – 7 October 1747)  was an Italian painter, active in Venice. [SEP]  Her dark, tense style contrasted with the dominant pastel colors of the late Baroque era.    Lama was born in the parish of Santa Maria Formosa in Venice. She was trained initially by her father, the painter Agostino Lama. She may have studied alongside a childhood friend, Giambattista Piazzetta (1682–1754), at the Scuola di Antonio Molinari in Venice. As a result of learning together their styles are similar in the sharp contrasts of light and shade. Piazzetta  painted a portrait of his friend in c.1715–1720. A letter written by the Abate Conti to Madame de Caylus in March 1728 has been important in determining Lama's background and character. He remarks, ""The poor girl is persecuted by the painters, but her virtue triumphs over her enemies. It is true that she is as ugly as she is witty but she speaks with grace and precision, so that one easily forgives her her face."" The letter reveals that in addition to being a painter she was skilled in mathematics, poetry, and lace making.  Lama was active as a historical painter and poet in Venice from till after 1753. One of her pieces, a Crucifixion altarpiece, remains in situ at San Vitale. She had a successful career in private and public figure painting. Lama appears to have been one of the first women to break the barrier against women studying and drawing the nude figure from life. Over 200 drawings that were recently discovered clearly show that she indeed studied both male and female nude figures during her training. She had public success in a style that was typically a position held by men, giving rise to opposition from her male counterparts who were not prepared to tolerate such competition. As a highly trained professional, she was just as capable of painting a sensitive portrait such as Young Man with a Turban as she was of carrying out large, original commissions, such as altarpieces, with confidence. It is through the identification of three such altarpieces in a Venetian guidebook of 1733 that Lama's artistic personality began to be reconstructed. That she was as fully competent as the male artists with whom she competed is demonstrated by the names to which her work has been attributed. Recovery of Lama's oeuvre has required reattribution of works by not only Piazzetta, but also artists such as Federico Bencovich, Domenico Maggiotto, Francesco Capella, and Zurbarán, among others.

"Maddalena ""Madaluzza"" Contarini Gradenigo (fl. 1779), was a Venetian aristocrat. [SEP] She was known for the scandals surrounding her notorious love affairs, which brought her in conflict with the Venetian Inquisition and exemplified its opposition to the informal changes in women's positions in 18th-century Republic of Venice.    Madaluzza Contarini was born a member of the Contarini family, one of the most powerful in the Republic of Venice. She married Carlo Gradenigo, the Venetian governor of Verona. The case of Madaluzza Contarini Gradenigo was one of the more famed of its time, and belonged to the Inquisition's opposition to the new freedom of aristocratic women in 18th-century Venice. Previously, the upper class women of Venice had by custom lived a secluded life. This changed in the early 18th-century, when the daughters of the doge Domenico Contarini, by their example, ended the use of zoccoli, a type of shoe customarily used by Venetian upper class women and restricting their movements. After this, the female members of the Venetian aristocracy begun to participate in social life escorted by the cavaliere servente, attended the theater and kept their own apartments outside of the homes, called Casino's, which soon became known as gambling halls.This informal development met with great resistance from the church, who which to set examples in the opposite direction, who in 1774 banned women from behaving to freely in public and, two years later, banned women from attending the theater without a mask and a veil and prosecuted Elisabetta Labia Priuli, Maria Bon Todarini and Julia Tron for having violated the ban. The case of Madaluzza Contarini Gradenigo was notable example of this conflict. On 14 September 1755, she was officially banned from Verona. The reason was her companionship with several men, both above and below her social status, both Venetians as well as foreigners. She returned to Venice where she was first kept under house arrest, but eventually exiled to the countryside. She settled in Gorizia. In 1764, she was prosecuted by the Venetian Inquisition. She had been reported to the Archbishop of Udine because she openly lived with a lieutenant Arneh in Gorizia, and for having participated in high society life with him. When she was widowed, she remarried Bortolo Gradenigo, the Venetian ambassador to Paris. On 1 February 1765, the Inquisition banned her from accompanying her spouse to his position in Paris, so as to not bring Venice into disrepute because of her personal lifestyle. When her spouse was appointed ambassador to Vienna, she was banned from accompanying him there by the Venetian authorities for the same reasons. When he was appointed ambassador to Constantinople in 1775, however, her spouse arranged for her to be brought to him there in secret before she could be banned from it. Her presence in the Ottoman Empire was deemed destructive to the reputation of the Republic of Venice because of her infamous reputation, particularly in an Islamic country, and on 31 July 1775, the Venetian Inquisition sent a demand to her spouse to send her back. He refused, however, and she stayed with him for four years. Not until 13 July 1779, she finally returned to Venice. She was arrested upon her arrival and placed in house arrest in her country villa in Este.    Caterina Sagredo Barbarigo   "

She was brought back to Venice at the age of nine and placed in a fashionable boarding school kept by a Frenchwoman. She was considered a bookworm and a woman with an independent mind.    At the age of 20 she married Marc Antonio Michiel on 25 October 1775. They followed her father to Rome, not long after, where he had been named the Venetian ambassador to Pope Pius VI. Though she only stayed one year she made a profound impression on the Roman society and was given the nickname Venerina Veneziana, Venetian Venus. It was during this trip that Giustina gave birth to a daughter in 1776, Elena. They had two other daughters who were born over the course of the next two years, Cecilia and Chiara (died at age ten). She was often left alone with her children while her husband traveled and so she was unhappy and ended up getting a divorce from her husband on 4 August 1784 Their divorce left her free to enjoy an active social life, which had been something her husband did not approve of.When she came back from her yearlong stay in Rome, her father’s brother was elected doge. Because the people refused to accept his wife Margherita Delmaz, a dancer, as a dogaressa, Giustina Renier Michiel had to step in. She served as first lady in all official ceremonies when necessary between the years of 1779 and 1789 while also pursuing her intellectual passions and hosting a literary salon.    Giustina Renier Michiel’s salon was considered one of the two most in vogue salons of Venice, the other being that of her friend Isabella Teotochi. There was a particularly Venetian character to her salon and it was frequented by well-known literary figures such as Ippolito Pindemonte, Marina Querini Benzon, Ugo Foscolo, Giustiniana Wynne (Countess Rosenberg), the French Madame de Staël and the English Lord Byron. She built connections between people, introducing scholars to one another, and promoted socializing and intellectual conversation. Her salon was not all about intense intellect; it had a good stream of recreational pleasure. Vittorio Malamani had said that her guests often arrived after midnight once the theater finished in order to discuss the works that they had just seen and to play ""society games.""When Napoleon invaded Venice, she closed her salon and pursued the study of botany and the publishing of her Shakespeare translations for the next ten years. She translated Othello and Macbeth in 1798 and Coriolanus in 1800 from English to Italian.    During this time she also started her monumental work published in six volumes, Le origine delle feste veneziane. The book was heavily researched and was an extensive look into Venice’s festivals, myths and public rituals. This collection of Venetian traditions was one way in which she tried defending Venice and its history. ""She seemed to make it her duty to prevent anything from disturbing the ghost of the defunct republic.""    She eventually reopened her salon and held it thus till her death. She was a patroness of Canova and a correspondent with Chateaubriand. She wrote many letters, many of which went to her niece Adriana Zannini, Marc Antonio Michiel, Contessa Marina Beneti Cicciaponi and many others. In her later years she had to wear an ear trumpet for she became deaf. On April 6, 1832 she died surrounded by her friends and grandchildren at the age of 77.   "

[SEP]       He started his service on board of the galleys of the Venetian Navy as nobile di nave (a rank roughly equal to Midshipman in the contemporary Royal Navy), when almost all the young men of his social class tried the best they could to avoid the perils of the military career, both on land or at the sea. Shortly after, he asked and obtained to be transferred on board of the Armada Grossa, the sailing warships' Division of Venice, and distinguished himself under the command of Angelo Emo in 1788, during the victorious campaign against the Bey of Tunis.Subsequently, he was awarded with the rank of sopra-comito (commander of a galley) in Dalmatia. In this position he was surprised by the surrender of Venice in 1797.    In 1810 he distinguished himself in the first Franco-Italian attempt to conquer the island of Lissa. In the following year he was the commander, with the rank of Corvette Captain, of the Italian frigate Corona, a fifth rate ship of 40 guns. During the battle he engaged HMS Cerberus in a short-range duel, inflicting heavy damage to the enemy but receiving equal; the wreck of the French frigate Favorite with the death of Commodore Dubourdieu and the arrival of HMS Active forced him to follow in the retreat to the east the frigates Danaé and Carolina. The Active, the only British ship still in fighting condition, quickly reached the Corona at 12.30 in the small channel between Lissa and the little island of Spalmadon. At 14.30, after a 45 minutes fight resulting in a fire that broke up aboard of his ship, he was forced to struck his colour in surrender.   "

"Antonio Maria Zanetti (the younger), also Anton Maria Zanetti, (1706–1778) was a Venetian art historian, noted for his knowledge of antiquities, numismatics, statues, cameos, and sculpted gems. [SEP] He was skilled in architecture and perspective and was an expert in music. As custodian of the Marciana Library (1737–1778), he compiled the first modern catalogs of the manuscript collection with detailed bibliographical information.    Antonio Maria was born in the parish of San Giacomo dell'Orio in Venice on 1 January 1706. He was the elder of two sons. The family of his father, Alessandro Zanetti, belonged to the citizen class, whereas the family of his mother, Antonia Limonti, originated in Milan. At an unknown later date, the family transferred to the parish of Santa Maria Mater Domini. As a youth, Antonio Maria studied with the Jesuits. He had a particular aptitude for the classics and, overtime, became proficient in Greek. He also learned to paint under the guidance of Nicolò Bambini. Most importantly, he became a protegé of his homonymous older cousin Antonio Maria Zanetti and developed into a distinguished scholar of the antiquities and an art connoisseur. Beginning in the early 1720s, Zanetti collaborated with his elder cousin on the edition of a two-volume work illustrating the classical sculpture conserved in the Venetian public collections. For this work, Zanetti provided many of the drawings of the statues. The engraving plates were made primarily by Giovanni Antonio Faldoni along with Giuseppe Camerata, Giovanni Cattini, Carlo Orsolini, Marco Alvise Pitteri, and Giuseppe Patrini. Although the initial project called for the presentation of all of the classical statues in the public collections, the two volumes of Delle antiche statue greche e romane, che nell'antisala della Libreria di San Marco, e in altri luoghi pubblici di Venezia si trovano, published in 1740 and 1743, only present 100 pieces. These were primarily from the Public Statuary but also include five statues in the courtyard of the Doge's Palace, the four horses of Saint Mark's Basilica, and the lions of the Arsenal. During this time, Zanetti was also tasked by Lorenzo Tiepolo, the state librarian, with compiling a complete two-volume catalog with detailed descriptions of the 224 statues belonging to the Public Statuary, located within the Marciana Library.In 1736, Tiepolo also asked Zanetti, together with Antonio Bongiovanni, to catalog the manuscripts in the library. Zanetti was subsequently nominated custodian of the library, in 1737, when the position became vacant. The catalogs of the Greek, Latin, and vernacular codices, published in 1740 and 1741, contain descriptions of 1356 codices. WIth respect to the previous 'catalogs', printed inventories, the new catalogs followed modern guidelines and constituted a considerable development in providing readers with bibliographical material.

"Francesco Loredan (9 February 1685 in Venice – 19 May 1762 in Venice) was a Venetian statesman of the Loredan family; he served as the 116th Doge of Venice from 18 March 1752 until his death. [SEP]  Loredan was a man of modest culture and limited political experience, having been raised primarily for a life of commerce; in this he stood in stark contrast to his immediate predecessor, Pietro Grimani, who was a poet and diplomat.  Loredan was succeeded as Doge by Marco Foscarini.    Loredan was elected on 18 March 1752 but the announcement was on 6 April, postponed because of Easter. By this point, the dogal figure had lost nearly all his power and he quickly adapted to this new situation. One of the biggest issues in domestic politics at the time was the clash between the conservatives and the reformers.  The latter wanted to substantially reform the Republic and sought to build internal reforms.  The conservative pressure groups were able to block these plans and imprisoned or exiled the reformis leaders, such as Angelo Querini, an important figure of the Venetian Enlightenment.  The Doge did not want to show favour to one side or the other, so he remained totally passive and limited his support to making it easier for the winning side, thereby losing his chance to change the fate of the dying republic.  By impeding the development of the reformist ideas, he possibly caused the small economic boom which started around 1756 with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War.  The neutrality of the Republic during this time allowed the merchants to trade in huge markets without competitors.  The French defeat even allowed Venice to become the biggest market for eastern spices.  At one point the Doge, who was old and tired by then, seemed about to die but recovered and lived for another year, until his death on 19 March 1762.  The other nobles, such as Marco Foscarini, anxiously spent this time hoping that they could replace him was a sign.  This was a sign of how little they respected him. Their disrespect was so strong they often mocked him, even in public. He was buried in the basilica Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, in his grandfather Leonardo Loredan's Dogal tomb.

"Ludovico Giovanni Manin (IPA /.ma'niŋ/, 14 May 1725 – 24 October 1802) was a Venetian politician, a Patrician of Venice and the last Doge of Venice. [SEP] He governed the Venetian Republic from 9 March 1789 until 1797, when he was forced to abdicate by Napoleon Bonaparte.       Lodovico Manin was the eldest of five sons of Lodovico III Alvise (1695–1775) and Lucrezia Maria Basadonna, the great-granddaughter of cardinal Pietro Basadonna. He attended the University of Bologna and was a boarder at the noble College of St. Xavier. Manin printed propositions of natural law, which he studied during this period. When Manin began public life he was quickly noticed for his generosity, honesty, kindness, and wealth. He married Elisabetta Grimani (d 1792) on 14 September 1748; she bore him a dowry of 45,000 ducats. Elisabetta had been educated in a monastery in Treviso and was in poor health since childhood. She did not give birth to any children.  At 26 he was elected captain of Vicenza, then of Verona, where he had to cope with a flood in 1757, and finally Brescia. In 1764, he was appointed procurator de ultra of Saint Mark's Basilica. Fond of religious meditations, in 1769 he asked and obtained permission to not hold an office because of ill health and bad hearing. In 1787, he was chosen to honor Pope Pius VI as he crossed the possessions of Venice and the Pope rewarded him with a knighthood. As the eldest son, he owned the Villa Manin di Passariano which was later inherited by his nephew, Lodovico Leonardo I (1771–1853). Lodovico Leonardo was the son of his brother Giovanni (1736–1774) and Caterina (Pesaro), the heiress of a wealthy noble Israelite family who claimed to descend from Cyrus the Great.    Lodovico was elected Doge of Venice on 9 March 1789, approximately four months before the start of the French Revolution, on the first ballot (the electoral assembly was composed of 41 members). His traditional coronation ceremony required him to throw coins to the Venetians, which cost more than 458,197 Lira, less than a quarter of which was paid from the funds of the Republic of Venice, the rest coming out of his own pocket. By the year 1792, he had allowed the once great Venetian merchant fleet to decline to a mere 309 merchantmen.  When Napoleon invaded Italy, Venice, along with the Republic of Genoa, did not initially join the coalition of Italian states formed in 1795, instead maintaining neutrality. On 15 April 1797, French general Jean-Andoche Junot gave the Doge an ultimatum which he refused. A secret addition to the Treaty of Leoben, signed on 17 April 1797, gave Venice, alongside Istria and Dalmatia, to Austria. On 25 April 1797, the French fleet arrived at the Lido. Venetian cannons sank one of the ships, but did not succeed in repelling the invasion since the Venetian war fleet numbered only 4 galleys and 7 galliots. The Doge surrendered on 12 May 1797 and left the Doge's Palace two days later. On 16 May French troops entered Piazza San Marco and the surrender contract was officially signed, submitting Venice to French rule.     Following his abdication, Manin refused an offer to become the interim head of the municipality and withdrew from society. Manin resided in the Palazzo Dolfin Manin, reportedly refusing even to answer his door to friends. He returned the ducal insignia (principally the distinctive ducal crown known as the corno ducale) alongside the ""Golden Book"" that served as a register of the oligarchical families of Venice to the Piazza San Marco, where they were hidden by the new city authorities. Due to health reasons, he was forced to walk outside frequently and was sometimes made the object of insults from former citizens. These antagonizers lamented Venice's changed fortunes and were angered by his decision to surrender to France. He wanted to end his days in a monastery, but this proved impossible. Lodovico died in his villa of dropsy and heart problems on 24 October 1802. His will ordered that his funeral should take place ""with the least possible pomp"". He left 110,000 ducats to the Manin Foundation for the benefit of the city's lunatics, orphans, and girls from poor families needing a dowry. His remains were interred in the chapel of the Church of the Scalzi in Venice, near the present railway station of Venice Saint Lucia in the family tomb of Manin where his late wife already lay.

In 1696 he was named Provveditore generale di Dalmazia until 1702, then again from 1717 to 1720. During his second tenure, he managed to extend Venetian Dalmatia into the hinterland, taking the areas of Signo, Imoschi and Vrgorac.

Rebuilding commenced around 1340, though interrupted for several years because of the plague.Calendario is attributed by some sources as the first architect or, at least, a collaborator. Calendario first appears in official records in 1340, when he is described as a master of two small boats, used to transport stone for construction. By 1341 he was the owner of five boats. This makes it likely he was also a stonemason.The new building was in the Venetian Gothic style, low and squat to cope with the poor ground conditions. However, the Palace is noticeably built in two phases and this is believed to be because, in 1355, Calendario was executed.     The new Doge of Venice, Marino Faliero (elected 1354), had ambitions to become Lord of Venice. However, the plot was uncovered and the conspirators arrested. Calendario was one of those found guilty of treason and, with the leader of the conspiracy Bertuccio Israello, sentenced to be hanged on 16 April 1355. They were both hanged from the balcony of the new Palace, reportedly with gags in their mouths. Calendario's son was also amongst the guilty men and later he was also hanged from the building.   "
"Jacopo Celega (d. before 30 March 1386) was a fourteenth-century Italian architect. [SEP] Little is known of Calegna's biography, but some of his work remains today. Around 1330 he took over construction of the Venetian church Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari – normally referred to only as the Frari – work that was finished by his son Pier Paolo in 1396.   "
"Andrea Cominelli was an Italian stonemason, sculptor and architect who was active in the Republic of Venice during the second half of the 17th century. [SEP]     Little is known of Cominelli's youth. He was probably born in Venice in the first half of the 17th century into a family from Bergamo. In 1652 Francesco and Tommaso Morosini commissioned Cominelli to restore the facade of the Church of San Clemente on the Isola di San Clemente. He included busts of Morosini family members above the portal, and their coat of arms. He also added statues of Saint Benedict and Saint Romuald, and a Madonna and cherub. The facade includes reliefs of scenes from battles commemorating the Morosini's victories in the war against the Turks. He is thought to have himself made the sculptures of the two brothers Morosini and of the two saints.    Cominelli is recorded on a bill of payment dated 4 April 1653 for implementation of an altar in the church of the new Venetian convent of the Carmelites of St. Theresa. He was engaged in this work until the end of 1654. He supervised construction of the convent and church of San Palo between 1682 and 1683, said by Brandolese in 1795 to have ""some elegance, that would be greater if it were not encrusted with stucco"". In 1679 he was in charge of the arrangement of the organ, with the work done by Eugenio Gasparini. On 7 April 1682 he signed an agreement for the partial reconstruction and beautification of the altar of the Blessed Virgin of Carmel. The church and convent of St. Teresa were built by Cominelli for the Sisters of Saint Theresa and consecrated in 1688.  The church has a tall, square and simple design.     While working almost continuously for the Carmelites, Cominelli undertook other works.  He made the altar of Baldassarre Longhena's St. Mary the Virgin in 1674-1677. He participated in the competition for design of the ""Dogana da Mar"" customs house (1676-1677). There are no records of activity after 1688. However, he was credited with the design of the Palazzo Labia, built for private clients. Cominelli designed the water facades of the building. The building was completed in 1696. Later the ballroom was decorated by the perspective artist Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna and the fresco painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The paintings tell the story of Anthony and Cleopatra. In the mid-18th century Alessandro Tremignon designed the campo facade of the palace.   "
"Giorgio da Sebenico (Croatian: Juraj Dalmatinac; c. 1410 – 10 October 1473) was a Venetian sculptor and architect from Venetian Dalmatia, who worked mainly in Sebenico (now Šibenik, Croatia), and in the city of Ancona, then a maritime republic. [SEP]    Giorgio da Sebenico was born from the Roman noble family of Orsini in the Dalmatian city of Zara (now Zadar, Croatia), which was part of the Republic of Venice (see Venetian Dalmatia).He emigrated to Venice during his youth, where he was probably trained as a sculptor in the workshop of Giovanni and Bartolomeo Bon, or at least worked with them as an independent associate.  He would not have been awarded the great responsibility of the 1441 Šibenik contract without having experience of major works, and various attributions of surviving sculptures in Venice to him, as part of the Bon workshop, have been made, including the decorations on the Porta della Carta of the Doge's Palace. Anne Markham Schultz dismisses all previous suggestions as stylistically incompatible, but instead proposes the relief of Saint Mark enthroned among members of the Confraternity of Saint Mark in the lunette above the main entrance to the Scuola di San Marco, which she dates to 1437-1438 and finds close in style to Giorgio's later works at Šibenik and elsewhere.  As his style here has few similarities to other works by the Bons, she considers it most likely that he worked with them when already a master, who had trained elsewhere.  She believes his personal style offers few clues as to where this might have been.In 1441, when still resident in Venice, Giorgio was summoned to Šibenik in order to take charge of the construction of the Cathedral of St. James. He moved by the end of August, and in 1443 was awarded the title of master under the condition set in the contract with the procurators of the Cathedral to take up residence there for at least six years. On 1 September 1446 he agreed to extend his contract as chief architect for another ten years. Giorgio was granted permission to remain in Venice for two months every two years on condition that he did no work there except on his own house. He will work on the Cathedral from 1441 till 1473, although discontinuously because the work were interrupted several times for lack of funds and probably for a fire. In Venice he married Elisabetta Da Monte (daughter of Gregorio da Monte, a Venetian carpenter), who brought him as her dowry some houses in Venice.  After 1450 he worked in both Ancona and Sebenico, with a period in Dubrovnik between June 1464 and November 1465, mostly working on the fortifications.  He travelled to Rome in 1470-71.  He is believed to have died in Sebenico on 10 October 1473.It is believed that his descendants inhabited Sebenico until the end of the 17th century.     His work represents the golden age of Dalmatian medieval art. He was one of main artists of the Adriatic Renaissance, a tendency widespread during the late 15th century in Venice, Dalmatia and in some locations of the Italian Adriatic Coast, such as Ancona.  According to Stanko Kokole, ""Although his style was firmly based on the Venetian Late Gothic tradition, Giorgio was fascinated by the Florentine Renaissance, the influence of which is apparent in his figure sculptures."" Influences and borrowings from many Florentine sculptors including Donatello, Ghiberti, Luca della Robbia, Niccolò Pizzolo, Antonio del Pollaiuolo, and Jacopo della Quercia can be detected in various works.His most beautiful achievement remains the Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik for which he was a chief architect from 1441 till 1473. The entire building was built solely of limestone from Istria, with no wood or bricks used in the structure. The building presents all along the perimeter a hedge composed of 72 stone-carved heads. On top of this hedge, and precisely on the North side, Giorgio added two angels; at the base of this work the artist engraved his signature. The task before him was to build the choir, of which foundations had not been laid, to raise and roof the nave which was only completed to the top of the aisle vaults, and to covering the crossing by a lantern or cupola. Unfortuately lack of funding and a fire delayed the achievement of the construction. From 1 July 1477 the work on the Cathedral of St. James was continued by an architect from Tuscany, Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino. In Split he built several palaces. In 1448 he carved a stone altar in the Cathedral of Saint Domnius, with a remarkable representation of the flagellation of Christ. In Dubrovnik he helped repairing the Duke's Palace and helped building the Minčeta fortress in 1464 and 1465. He also distincted himself as urbanist. Around 1450 he made an urban plan for Pag and contributed to the project and construction of Pelješac walls. He was at the same time sculptor, architect and urban planner, showing in this his belonging to the cultural climate and orientation of Renaissance. In Italy, he worked in Ancona where he built the Loggia dei Mercanti, the portal of San Francesco alle Scale and the portal of Sant'Agostino.  During his career Renaissance style gradually replaced the Gothic, in line with the European tendency during the 15th century for Gothic to become more elaborate sophisticated, giving birth to the late Gothic style known in Venice as Gotico Fiorito and Flamboyant in France.Among his disciples, the most known are Andrea Alessi and Radmillo Allegretti, whose works are in Cattaro and Zara.  		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		     At the feet of the two Renaissance putti by the north apse of Cathedral of St.James the artist signed in Latin: ""hoc opus cuvarum fecit magister Georgius Mathaei Dalmaticus"", and on a contract from 1441 he signed: ""Georgius lapicida quondam Mathei de Jadra Civis Sibenicenis"" (trans. ""Georgius sculptor son of Matheus from Zadar citizen of Šibenik""). Those are only known signatures of the artist. References to the artist are most common under the name Giorgio da Sebenico, and as Giorgio Orsini, particularly in Italian sources or in older English sources. There are also references to him as ""Giorgio Dalmatico"" or as ""George the Dalmatian"". He is rarely listed among Croatian sculptors in English-language sources. In Croatia, he is known under the Croatian name of Juraj Matejev Dalmatinac. The family name of Orsini was never used by the artist and it was adopted by his son, after the death of his father.   "
"Bernardino Maccarucci (c. 1728 – 1798) was an Italian architect, active in his native Venice. [SEP] He was a pupil of Giorgio Massari, but most of his work in the declining republic was merely in reconstructions and restorations. He helped build the facade of the church of San Rocco (1765–71) and of the Scuola della Carità (1766, design by Massari, now the Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice); he worked in the palazzo del Ridotto (1768) and one of the Banquet rooms in the Palazzo Ducale. In Mestre, he designed the construction of the Chiesa Collegiata. In Padua, he helped build the Palazzo del Capitanio (1779). He died in Venice.  		 		 		   "
"Bernardo Morando, also known as Bernardino or Morandi (ca. 1540 - 1600) was an Italian architect from the Republic of Venice. [SEP] He is notable as the designer of the new town of Zamość, modelled on Renaissance theories of the 'ideal city'. Born around 1540 in either Padua or Venice, Morando moved to Poland in 1569, where he started working as an architect. On July 1, 1578 he signed an agreement with Jan Zamoyski, one of the wealthiest men of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for a project of an ideal city and fortress for the founder. The extreme opulence that Poland's nobility enjoyed during the Renaissance left Poland's elites with not only obscene amounts of money to spend, but also motivated them to find new ways to invest their hefty fortunes away from the grasp of the Royal Treasury. Zamoyski, Great Crown Chancellor and Hetman whose financial empire within the Polish Republic spanned 6400 km² with 11 cities and over 200 villages, in addition to the royal lands he controlled of over 17 500 km² with 112 cities and 612 villages. Zamoyski's estates functioned as a country within a country, and he decided to found the city of Zamość in order to circumvent royal tariffs and duties while also serving as the capital for his mini-state. Until 1586 Morando prepared plans of the new city, as well as supervised the erection of first notable monuments, including the Lublin Gate, arsenal and Zamoyski's palace. Between 1587 and 1594 he supervised the construction of the Town Hall and the collegiate church, one of the most notable examples of classical Renaissance architecture north of the Alps. It was completed by 1598, two years before Morando's death. Aside from the notable projects, throughout his stay in Zamość Morando also supervised the construction of burgher houses and the notable star-shaped fortifications. Zamość was so successful that 11 years after its construction began it had only 26 empty lots left. However, it was not until the 1620s when his successor, Andrea dell'Aqua, completed the fortress. During the following years Zamość Academy and numerous churches were built. Apart from the city of Zamość, Morando also prepared plans of construction of two smaller fortified towns: Tomaszów Lubelski and Szarogród in Podolia, in what is now Ukraine. It is also probable that he created the scenery for Jan Kochanowski's Odprawa posłów greckich, the first Polish drama staged during Zamoyski's marriage to Krystyna née Radziwiłł. For his merits to Zamoyski, he was given two large houses in Zamość. Between 1591 and 1593 he was also the mayor of that city and was ennobled. He married certain Katarzyna, with whom he had six children. His successors used the Polish name of Morenda and used the Mora Coat of Arms granted to Bernardo Morando. He himself died in Zamość in 1600 and was buried in the collegiate church he built not so long before. One of his sons, Gabriel Morenda, became a doctor of science at the University of Padua and returned to Zamość, where he became the mayor and judge. He was also a professor of mathematics at the Zamość Academy which was built according to his father's plans.   "
"Michele Sanmicheli (also spelled Sanmmicheli, Sanmichele or Sammichele) (1484–1559), was a Venetian architect and urban planner of Mannerist-style, among the greatest of his era. [SEP] A tireless worker, he was in charge of designing buildings and religious buildings of great value. Hired by the Serenissima as a military architect, he designed also numerous fortifications in the extensive Venetian Empire, thus ensuring a great reputation. In fact, not only in Italy, where you can find his works in Venice, Verona, Bergamo and Brescia, he worked also in Dalmatia, Zadar (Zara), Šibenik, Crete and Corfu. He was probably the only practicing Venetian architect of the sixteenth century to have had the opportunity to study Greek architecture, a possible source of inspiration for the use of Doric columns without bases.    Sanmicheli was born in San Michele, a quarter of Verona, which at the time was part of the Venetian Terra ferma. He learnt the elements of his profession from his father Giovanni and his uncle Bartolomeo, who both practised successfully as builder-architects in Verona. Like Jacopo Sansovino he was a salaried official of the Republic of Venice, but unlike Sansovino, his commissions lay in Venetian territories outside Venice; he was no less distinguished as a military architect, and was employed in strengthening Venetian fortifications in several cities of Crete and most notably Candia, Dalmatia and Corfu as well as a great fort at the Lido, guarding the sea entrance to the Venetian lagoon. He went at an early age to Rome, probably to work as an assistant to Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, where he had opportunities to study classic sculpture and architecture. In 1509 he went to Orvieto where he practiced for the next two decades. Among his earliest works are the first design of the duomo of Montefiascone, initiated in 1519, an octagonal building surmounted with a dome, and the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, he designed and built the funerary chapel for the Petrucci family in the Gothic church of San Domenico in Orvieto. Several palazzi at both places are attributed to him. Sanmicheli was in Verona by 1527 at the latest, working on the monumental cannon-resistant city gates; he began to transform the fortifications of Verona according to the newer system of corner bastions, a system for the advancement of which he did much valuable service. Sanmicheli built two massively fortified and richly decorated city gates for Verona, the Porta Nuova and the Porta Palio, in which the richest possible Roman Doric is superimposed against layers of rustication. Giorgio Vasari's impression was that ""in these two gates it may truly be seen that the Venetian Senate made full use of the architect's powers and equalled the buildings and works of the ancient Romans – the constant aim and ultimate goal of the Renaissance architects. He also regularised the Piazza Brà, opening up a vista to the Arena.   "
"Pietro Negri (1628, Venice - 31 May 1679, Venice) was an Italian painter in the Baroque style who belonged to the so-called ""tenebrosi"" (dark or gloomy ones).     He was likely born in Venice. [SEP] Early sources assumed that he was the son of a sculptor named Domenico Negri, but his father's name is given as Lunardo in some documents and Francesco in others. His first art lessons came from Matteo Ponzone. Later, he worked with Francesco Ruschi. In his early days, much of his work is difficult to distinguish, stylistically, from Antonio Zanchi.  His first verified work is from 1658, when he signed an engraving on the frontispiece of Antioco by the poet, Nicolò Minato. The paintings attributed to him, prior to the 1660s, are all missing. A painting of Antonio e Cleopatra is dated from c.1664. In 1670, he produced the Albero serafico dei Ordini francescani (Seraphic Tree of the Franciscans), currently at the basilica of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. One of his best known works is Nerone che esamina il corpo di Agrippina (Nero Examining the Corpse of Agrippina), in the collection of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden.He married Franceschina Maria Barbara, with whom he had two sons. She died shortly after giving birth to the second and he remarried in 1673, to Angela Caroli, the widow of a merchant. In 1673, he created what many consider to be his masterpiece; a monumental ""telero"" (canvas applied directly to a wall) depicting Mark the Evangelist and Saint Rocco, who interceded with the Virgin Mary to end a plague in Venice, on the left wall of the staircase at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, opposite a depiction of the plague of 1630, by Zanchi.He also took the occasional student; notably the Late Baroque painter, Simone Brentana. He died of what is believed to have been tuberculosis. He was interred, at his widow's expense, in the Church of Saint Augustine, which was demolished in 1873, after many years of serving as a mill.   "

"Pomponio Amalteo (1505 – 9 March 1588) was an Italian painter of the Venetian school.    He was born at Motta di Livenza in Veneto in 1505.  He was a pupil and son-in-law of Il Pordenone, whose style he closely imitated; he inherited Pordenone's studio in Friuli, where he led a long career.  His works consist chiefly of frescoes and altarpieces and many of which (for instance those in the church of Santa Maria de' Battisti and the altarpiece of Saint Sebastian (1533) at the duomo of San Vito al Tagliamento) have degraded greatly over time. [SEP] Five pictures representing subjects of Roman history painted by Amalteo adorn the Hall of the Notaries at Belluno. He also frescoed a series of judges for a loggia in the court of justice in Ceneda. His shading is weaker; colors, brighter; and proportions of figures, less elegant, than those of Pordenone, of which he was likely the most accomplished of his pupils. His brother Girolamo Amalteo is supposed to have assisted him in his labors. His daughter Quintilia Amalteo had the reputation of an excellent portraitist; she married the painter Giuseppe Moretto.  Girolamo, besides the works in which he aided his brother, executed small pictures, painted in fresco, and produced  an altarpiece for the church of San Vito.

"Jacopo Amigoni (ca. 1685–1752), also named Giacomo Amiconi, was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque or Rococo period, who began his career in Venice, but traveled and was prolific throughout Europe, where his sumptuous portraits were much in demand. [SEP]    He was born in Venice. Amigoni initially painted both mythological and religious scenes; but as the panoply of his patrons expanded northward, he began producing many parlour works depicting gods in sensuous languor or games. His style influenced Giuseppe Nogari. Among his pupils were Charles Joseph Flipart, Michelangelo Morlaiter, Pietro Antonio Novelli, Joseph Wagner, and Antonio Zucchi.Starting in 1717, he is documented as working in Bavaria in the Castle of Nymphenburg (1719); in the castle of Schleissheim (1725–1729); and in the Benedictine abbey of Ottobeuren. He returned to Venice in 1726. His Arraignment of Paris hangs in the Villa Pisani at Stra. From 1730 to 1739 he worked in England, in  Pown House, Moor Park Wolterton Hall and in the theatre of Covent Garden. From there, he helped convince Canaletto to travel to England by telling him of the ample patronage available.  In London or during a trip to Paris in 1736, he met the celebrated castrato Farinelli, whose portrait he painted twice in 1735 and again in 1752. Amigoni also encountered the painting of François Lemoyne and François Boucher.  In 1739 he returned to Italy, perhaps to Naples and surely to Montecassino, in whose Abbey existed two canvases (destroyed during World War II). He travelled to Venice to paint for Sigismund Streit, for the Casa Savoia and other buildings of the city.  In 1747 he left Italy for Madrid, encouraged by Farinelli, who held a court appointment there. He became court painter to Ferdinand VI of Spain and director of the Royal Academy of Saint Fernando. He painted a group portrait that included himself, Farinelli, Metastasio, Teresa Castellini, and an unidentified young man. The young man may have been the Austrian Archduke Joseph, the Habsburg heir to the throne. Amigoni died in Madrid.

"Marco Basaiti (c. 1470–1530) was a Renaissance painter who worked mainly in Venice and was a contemporary of Giovanni Bellini and Cima da Conegliano. [SEP] He has been referred to by several names including Marco Baxaiti, Marcus Basitus, and Marcus Baxiti. (Vasari believed that Marco Basarini and Marco Basaiti were two artists, but later information reveals that these two were in fact the same painter.) There is little documentation on Marco Basaiti besides his painting signatures and a guild's ledger of 1530 ithat records him as a painter of figures.His works are mainly portraits and often focused on religious themes. There is no known painting attributed to Marco Basaiti with a mythological theme. Although trained in the quattrocento style, Basaiti's career began right at the beginning of the cinquecento style which forced him to attempt to adapt his style to stay current.    Marco Basaiti was born around 1470, in either Venice or Friuli. His family was of either of Albanian or possibly Greek origin, as Vasari reported. In either case this explains the variety of names Basaiti is known by because the Greek and Albanian communities, and other foreign communities, for the most part kept to themselves and do not often appear on Venetian records.  A will dated 1526 may provide evidence of his family, but the connection between Basaiti and this will is debated. Due to this lack of documentation, not much is known about Basaiti's life, except what scholars can learn about the artist through his art.  There is evidence that Basaiti trained with Bartolomeo Vivarini as Basaiti's earlier pieces are thought to reflect Bartolomeo's style and composition. After Bartolomeo died in the late 1490s, it is thought that Basaiti began working with Alvise Vivarini, Bartolomeo's nephew. This is supported by the fact that when Alvise died in 1505, Basaiti was commissioned to finish the altar piece entitled St. Ambrose Enthroned with Saints that Alvise had left uncompleted. Typically only major assistants working in the studio would have been asked to do this type of work which suggests that Basaiti was closely connected to Alvise by this time. Additionally, Basaiti's work seems to be influenced stylistically by both Vivarinis, further implying the link between Basaiti and these two masters.Basaiti was influenced by a variety of great artists that lived during this era. For example, he began to incorporate more extensive landscapes into his backgrounds, taking inspiration from Giovanni Bellini. In fact, some of Bellini’s older works were misattributed to Basaiti for a long period of time. Another likely influence for Basaiti’s more complex backgrounds is the work of Netherlandish painters. Specifically, it has been noted that after Albrecht Dürer’s stay in Venice, Basaiti’s style shifted somewhat towards more complex and dramatic landscapes with less of an emphasis on the figures in the painting. This style can be seen in the Lamentation over the Dead Christ and St. Jerome in the Wilderness. The latter is thought to be a copy of a painting by Cima da Conegliano which presents yet one more important artistic influence in Marco Basaiti’s life. For the most part Basaiti focused on religious themes rarely delving into mythological or historical topics. Despite this his style seems fairly contemporary with complex composition and correct proportions.     More than half of Basaiti's known works come from this first period in his painting career. This period comes right after his training and is marked by a constantly changing style as Basaiti experiments with his art to find his own personal style. This era is marked by the Portrait of a Young Man (1495) which represents his first finished piece as an independent painter.Stylistically there are strong influences from his two proposed mentors in the composition of his paintings, with Bartolomeo specifically influencing his figure design. Notable features of the Antonellian include strong geometric forms and sharp contrast in lighting. Furthermore, in accordance with the style of his proposed masters, Basaiti’s paintings often feature brightly colored clothing and cool skin tones. Indeed, Basaiti’s early works are very like some of Alvise’s established disciples such as Jacopo da Valenza which further confirms the link between Basaiti and Alvise.  Around 1500, the influence of the Antonellian school becomes less distinct. Basaiti’s backgrounds become more developed demonstrating the influence of Giovanni Bellini and Northern artists. This development can be seen in paintings such as in Portrait of a Young Man (1505), where, in contrast to his first Portrait of a Young Man (1495), the screen behind the figure has been completely removed and the landscape given more importance. In addition to developing a more complex landscape composition, Basaiti appears to become more concerned with spatial consistency after 1500.This change to more expressive landscapes coincided with Albrecht Dürer's stay in Venice during 1505–1506. It has been suggested that the landscape style Basaiti adopted is more influenced by Netherlandish paintings than by Bellini.As Basaiti continued to mix the styles of Alvise and Bellini his paintings become comparable to Cima da Conegliano. However, Basaiti arrived at this mix of styles after Cima and he was never able to exert  the same influence.     This period represents the most cohesive time stylistically for Basaiti's paintings. It was a prosperous decade for Basaiti and included several large commissions such as the high altarpiece at Sant'Andrea della Certosa, the Call of the Sons of Zebedee. This piece in particular marked the beginning of his mature period and is considered by Vasari and many later critics to be one of his best pieces. Unlike the portraits which up until now had been his main artistic endeavors, the Calling of the Sons of Zebedee is a narrative painting which requires more complex composition, and features a detailed and expansive landscape. Although Basaiti tried to compose narrative paintings later on, none were as successful as this first one.  Another notable example of Basaiti’s work with narrative pieces is the Agony of Christ. This represents a large commission as the altarpiece of the Foscari in San Giobbe. This altarpiece is set up next similar pieces by Giovanni Bellini and the influence from Bellini in Basaiti's painting is obvious.Later, during this period, Basaiti’s paintings became more focused and returned to one-figure paintings as intricacies of narrative paintings proved to be too difficult. As seen in the Resurrected Christ and the Blessed Redeemer, while many aspects of Basaiti’s former success remain, the painting features only one main figure. Continuing his emphasis on the use of landscapes in paintings, backgrounds became more integrated into the overall painting but the influence of Bellini and of Netherlandish painters is still apparent. As Basaiti’s style developed, the light in his pictures became softer and the components of the painting blended more fluidly. This gradual shift towards softer lines and an emphasis on natural lighting was the popular style developing during this era. The quattrocento style in which Basaiti was trained was declining in popularity, and his attempts to incorporate some of the new techniques can be seen particularly in his later works.     This was Basaiti's last period and no paintings have been dated after 1530. Basaiti appears on a ledger for a painters guild in 1530 but there is no known mention of him after this ledger and he is presumed to have died in the early years of that decade. According to current estimations, this would have made him 60 around the time of his death. In this last decade of his painting career, his composition became slightly more developed and more in tune with the contemporary style but remained heavily influenced by the quattrocento style. During this time he mainly focused on portraits, which were the area where he was best able to adapt his style to the changing times. Landscapes started to decline in importance in his paintings although their presence never disappeared completely. One exception to this trend is the painting The Lamentation which once again demonstrates Basaiti's ability to compose narrative scenes. The Lamentation blends many of the influences throughout Basaiti's life and exhibits his progress towards more organic lighting and forms.Some call Basaiti one of the last masters of the early Renaissance and his works demonstrate a refined quattrocento style. However, despite his best efforts, his works are still generally considered to be one step behind the trends of the Venetian painting of that time.   "
"Lazzaro Bastiani (1429  – 5 April 1512) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance, active mainly in Venice. [SEP] He was born in Padua. He is first recorded as a painter in Venice by 1460 in a payment for an altarpiece of San Samuele, for the Procuratori di San Marco. In 1462 he was paid at the same rate as Giovanni Bellini. In 1470, he was a member of the Scuola di San Girolamo in Venice. In the 1480s he worked with Gentile Bellini for the Scuola Grande di San Marco. He painted a Coronation of the Virgin (Gallerie dell'Accademia); a Nativity (1477); and a St. Anthony on the Nut Tree. In 1508 he was called upon, with his pupil  Vittore Carpaccio, to estimate paintings of   Giorgione for the Fondaco dei Tedeschi.   "
"Francesco Battaglioli (Modena, 1725 – Venice, 1796) was an Italian painter, known as painter of veduta and capriccios based on  the scenery of Venice and the Venetian mainland (Brescia and Treviso).    Battaglioli was born in Modena. [SEP] He is said to have been a pupil of Raffaello Rinaldi. He joined the Fraglia or guild of painters in Venice between 1747-51. He became a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice in 1772, and he succeeded Antonio Visentini as professor of perspective in 1778. Some of his veduta are of Aranjuez in Spain, where he went to paint scenery sets for the Reales Coliseos theater held in the Palacio Real de Aranjuez for the delight of Ferdinand VI, it is believe they were a set of at least four, two of them are exhibited at the Prado Museum in Madrid. Here he also worked with Farinelli in painting stage sets for Pietro Metastasio's operas. From that series four of them are preserved at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (La Nitteti, Didone Abbandonata, Armida Placata Second Act, scene VII, and Knight fighting dragons in a forest), another at the Prado (Armida Placata First Act, scene IV). Battaglioli's veduta were engraved by Francisco Zucchi and used to illustrate Baldassare Camillo Zamboni’s Memorie intorno alle pubbliche fabbriche (1778).   "

"Antonio Bellucci (1654–1726) was an Italian soldier who became a painter of the Rococo period and was best known for his work in England, Germany, and Austria. [SEP] He was one of the many Venetian-trained artists of his time, including Ricci, Tiepolo, Amigoni, and others, who sought commissions north of Italy, providing patrons with the then-popular Italianate grand-manner frescoes for private palaces.    Born and died in Pieve di Soligo. He initially trained with Domenico Difnico in Sebenico (Sibenik) in the Venetian colony of Dalmatia (now part of Croatia). By 1675, he was working in Venice, painting St Lorenzo Giustiniani praying for the city’s deliverance from the plague of 1447 (c. 1691) for the church of San Pietro di Castello. He painted a Nativity for the church of the Ascension at Venice. Several of the landscapes of Antonio Tempesta are enriched with figures by Bellucci. Among his pupils were Antonio Balestra and perhaps Jacopo Amigoni. In 1692, he completed four altarpieces depicting various saints for the church of Klosterneuburg. From 1695-1700 and 1702- c. 1704, he lived in Vienna. He painted the Triumph of Hercules and other allegorical ceilings at the Palais Liechtenstein for Charles VI.    In 1705-1716, he travelled to Düsseldorf to work for Johann Wilhelm, Elector of the Palatinate, a member of the Wittelsbach family; he worked there almost continuously until his patron’s death in 1716. For Schloss Bensberg, he painted the Marriage of John William with Anna Maria Luisa de’ Medici and Elector Palatine John William Handing the Baton of Command to his Son.From 1716-1722, Bellucci worked in England, where he fulfilled several commissions for James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, including ceilings at Cannons, the duke's country seat near London; at the neighboring St Lawrence, Whitchurch the paintings of the Nativity and the Descent from the Cross, which are seen on either side of the altar, and the Transfiguration, which is above the Duke’s pew, are attributed to him.   There is an almost Romantic self-portrait of Belluci, shirt open, at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The reproduction here does not legibly show that on his breast is written the word 'pictor' (painter), perhaps indicating that to be an artist was his heart's desire. He returned to his native country late in life, and died at Soligo.   "
"Antonio Bernieri (1516–1565) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. [SEP] He was born in Correggio. He was first trained under Correggio; on the death of that master he went to Venice, and attended Titian's school. He visited Rome, and returning to Venice worked there until 1563. He died at Correggio. Bernieri was an eminent painter of portrait miniatures. He is sometimes called 'Antonio da Correggio’, which unfortunately confuses him with his mentor.   "

"Giuseppe Bernardino Bison (16 June 1762 – 24 August 1844) was an itinerant Italian painter of frescoes, landscapes, vedute, capriccios and some religious works. [SEP]     He was born in Palmanova. When he was still a boy, his family moved to Brescia, where he saw the works of Girolamo Romani and decided to become a painter. Later, his family moved again, to Venice, where he enrolled at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia and worked with Costantino Cedini. While there, he became friends with the architect Gian Antonio Selva, and went with him to Ferrara in 1787 to help decorate the Palazzo Bottoni.Shortly after, he was in Padua, working as a set designer for the Obizzi family and, in 1790, was commissioned to do decorations for the Castello del Catajo. Two years later, he did similar work at the Palazzo Maffetti-Manzoni, then moved to Treviso, where he did frescoes on the ceiling of the Church of Saint Andrew in Volpago del Montello, the oratory of the Villa Bragadin in Ceggia and secular decorations for several villas in Lancenigo and Breda di Piave. From 1798 to 1800, he collaborated with Selva on decorations at the Palazzo Dolfin Manin in Venice.Moving on to Trieste, he collaborated with Matteo Pertsch and the sculptor Antonio Bosa (1780–1845) to provide decorations for the Palazzo Carciotti and the stock exchange building. In 1811, he was in Zara, working at the Palazzo del Governatore. This was followed by decorative work (now lost) at the theaters in Vipacco and Gorizia.At this time, he began to take advantage of a growing market for paintings in the homes of well-to-do non-aristocrats and, working in conjunction with a local art dealer named Tosoni, produced a wide variety of landscapes, vedute and other genres to satisfy local tastes. His canvases were expensive, but also very large. In 1831, despite his successes in Trieste, he began wandering again, returning briefly to Brescia, then settling in Milan where he took some smaller commissions, but was not very successful and died poor.

"Sebastiano Bombelli (October 1635; 4 May 1719) was an Italian painter, mainly active in Venice, during the Baroque period. [SEP]     He was born in Udine on 14 or 15 October 1635 (baptized on the 15th), educated and trained under the guidance of his father Valentino and the godfather Girolamo Lugaro, he moved from a young age to Venice where, after a period of specialization with Guercino in Bologna, he began his career studying the manner of Paolo Veronese, quickly becoming one of his greatest connoisseurs. The synthesis of the techniques of Cinquecento, of the impulse given by naturalists and of the contemporary taste of the ""tenebrosi"" was addressed by Bombelli in the sector in which he specialized most, namely portraiture. Not to underestimate his stay in Florentine, during which he was able to appreciate the technique of Sustermans.His first surviving work dates back to 1665, it is the  Portrait of Benedetto Mangilli (Civici Musei, Galleria d'Arte Antica, Udine), a painting that shows influences from Bernardo Strozzi. Among the peculiar characteristics of his works emerge vitality, expressiveness and communicability, both in the portraits anchored to the tradition Baroque like the  Polo Querini  of 1684 (Querini Stampalia Foundation, Venice) and in the most simplified ones. His characters emerge from the shadows although described to the smallest detail, showy with their showy and festive attires.Del 1675 is the first  Self-portrait  (Civici Musei, Galleria d'Arte Antica, Udine), characterized by a marked introspective vein and free from the embellishments typical of the  official portrait  which had made it famous to Venice.  One of his many followers was Fra' Galgario (Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi) who spent a decade in Venice and had the opportunity to meet and collaborate with Bombelli. For a time he also studied in his workshop a young man Anton Domenico Gabbiani, who learned much from Bombelli (see his first portraits, like those of the  Musicians of the court of the Grand Prince Ferdinando de 'Medici  at the Galleria dell'Accademia); the two artists remained on excellent terms throughout their lives, as demonstrated by a beautiful letter from Bombelli addressed to the former student in 1716. He was also the master of Domenico and Giovanni Battista Parodi, sons of the Genoese sculptor Filippo Parodi, a personal friend of the friulian painter; Bombelli's fame as a skilled portrait painter was known internationally, so much so that one of his pupils was Johann Gottfried Tannauer, famous painter and miniaturist at the court of Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. He was also very fond of friendship and affection with the fellow Luca Carlevarijs and with the young and promising Rosalba Carriera, of whom he painted an intense portrait on the occasion of his appointment to Academia di San Luca. His portraiture style later also influenced other painters, including Alessandro Longhi and Niccolò Cassana. Bombelli had a half brother, Raffaele, also a painter, less well known than Sebastiano and active in the Friuli area.  The artist also traveled and worked abroad, for example in Bavaria, where he portrayed the Elector Ferdinand Maria of Bavaria, his wife Enrichetta Adelaide di Savoia, the children Maria Anna Vittoria of Bavaria, Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria, Joseph Clement of Bavaria and his brother Maximilian Philip Jerome of Bavaria, to Innsbruch portraying the Archduchess Anna de 'Medici and the daughters Claudia Felicita of Austria (future emperor's Leopold I second wife) and Mary Magdalene, for the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, as well as Vienna where he portrayed the emperor Leopold I of Habsburg and the couple Joseph I of Habsburg and Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg, was also active in Florence, Mantua and Parma and lent his service to some cardinals. . His atelier in Venice was very famous and frequented by important personalities passing through Venice, in particular during Carnival: on this occasion he portrayed the prince in 1692 Frederick of Denmark (future king Frederick IV). Sebastiano Bombelli was also an art expert: being the greatest connoisseur of Paolo Veronese, he was often contacted to verify the authenticity of works that surfaced on the market. Concurrently with this activity, Bombelli was also a restorer. Unfortunately, to give new brilliance to ancient artworks, he used paints and lacquers that - with the passing of time - oxidized blackening the paint film. Various sources, contemporary and non-contemporary, refer to this information, in particular Lanzi. His mastery of the use of colors, however, was much appreciated, to the extent that he was the dedicatee of the text Nuovo plico d'ogni sorte di tinture by Gallipido Tallier - published in 1704 - and the painter was addressed with these words «... knowing the world the virtue, which she generally possesses of coloring and painting; And I am going to say, that the opre of his penoron have a not that of celestial, which dazzles the sight to whom they aim ...».He was a member of the fraglia pictorial of Venice from 1687 to 1700.Infirm in the last years of his life, he died in Venice on May 4, 1719. His executors were the beloved and powerful nephews Paolo and Girolamo Celotti, both Servite friars.   "
"Francesco Bonsignori (c. 1455 – July 2, 1519), also known as Francesco Monsignori, was an Italian painter and draughtsman, characterized by his excellence in religious subjects, portraits, architectural perspective and animals. [SEP] He was born in Verona and died in Caldiero, a city near Verona. Bonsignori's style in early period was under the influence of his teacher Liberale da Verona. After becoming the portraitist and court artist to the Gonzaga family of Mantua in 1487, his style was influenced by Andrea Mantegna, who also worked for Francesco Gonzaga from the 1480s. They collaborated to execute several religious paintings, mainly with the theme of Madonna and Child. The attribution of the portrait of a Venetian Senator (National Gallery, London) was debatable until the last century because of the similarity in techniques used by Bonsignori and his teacher Mantegna. During the phase of his career in Mantua, there is an undocumented period between 1495 and July 1506 with no official record regarding his activities by the court of Mantua. Bonsignori's late style was decisively influenced by Lorenzo Costa in terms of form and color. He produced his last monumental altarpiece the Adoration of the Blessed Osanna Andreasi (Pal.Ducale, Mantua) in 1519 shortly before his death.    Francesco Bonsignori was born in Verona in 1455, the eldest among three sons in the Bonsignori family. His father Albertus Bonsignori was a well-known amateur painter. In childhood, Francesco was the most artistically talented of the Bonsignori children. His brothers, Bernardino (c.1476–1520) and Girolamo (c.1479 – unknown) also became painters. His younger brother Girolamo was highly appraised for his fine copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper.       Bonsignori was the pupil and apprentice of Liberale da Verona (1451–1536). Liberale da Verona was at first a miniaturist, who developed a larger style based on a following of Mantegna's work. There are Venetian influences observed in the coloring and background of his paintings. Liberale da Verona has contributed to the spread of the Squarcione style to Siena, and played an important role in influencing some Sienese painters such as Girolamo da Cremona. His appreciation of Francesco Squarcione, founder of the Paduan school and teacher of Andrea Mantegna, subsequently influenced Bonsignori’s early style and taste. Liberale da Verona was well-known for painting frescoes and altarpieces. Although he was renowned for his inventiveness and verve, his later works expose a shortage of consistent innovation and originality compared to his earlier period.     Bonsignori’s early career is the most fully documented period of his life. Account of his early life is found in Giorgio Vasari’s book Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects. Vasari includes the painter in a group of minor virtuosi from Verona.  Bonsignori bears another name, ""Monsignori"", as he was miscalled by Vasari in his book. His pseudonym has appeared in several documentations from the Renaissance period, while he signed all his committed artwork with “Bonsignori”. Fewer than a dozen drawings attributed to Bonsginori during his early career have survived. Most paintings mentioned in Vasari's account have perished. He often integrated subtle elements observed in nature and daily life into religious paintings. In 1483, he produced his first signed work, Virgin and Child (Castelvecchio,Verona). The style of this work is similar to that of Madonna with Saints (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), produced by his teacher Liberale de Verona. Influenced by his teacher, Bonsignori produced several altarpieces from 1484 to 1492. He completed the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (Castelvecchio,Verona) in 1484. During Bonsignori's early career, he was inspired and influenced by different artists, including his early models Giovanni Bellini, Alvise Vivari, Antonello da Messina, and Andrea Mantegna. Integration of styles from different contemporary masters is notable in Bonsignori's early pieces, which were characterized by his concentration on human figures in devotional picture and portraits. Landscape and architectural settings in the background are often less significant in his paintings. Although derivative, Bonsignori's early style was recognizably his own.    Bonsignori's middle career period began after he moved to Mantua in 1487. The Portrait of a Venetian Senator (National Gallery, London) was signed and dated in 1487. Successively, he produced several altarpieces depicting The Virgin and Child Enthroned with Music-making Angels and SS George and Jerome (Banda Chapel, S Bernardino,Verona) in 1488. The Virgin and Child Enthroned with SS Anthony of Egypt and Onofrio, signed and dated in 1488, is known only through a 19th-century copy preserved in Florence. Accounts of Bonsignori's middle period are sourced from the official documents from the Gonzaga court in Mantua, but there is no official record of Bonsignori between 1495 and July 1506.     Francesco Bonsignori and his two brothers moved from Verona to Mantua in 1487. Francesco Bonsignori was employed by the Gonzaga family as a portrait painter and was in charge of decorations of their palace at Marmirolo and Gonzaga. Vasari reports that he lived at the court of Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, who provided him with a house for himself and his family. Bonsignori was also awarded a piece of land in the Gonzaga territory as reward for this service in 1494. Compliance with the wishes of Gonzaga family earned him both reputation and status as one of the most esteemed artist in Mantua. Due to the monopoly in the local artistic scene and prevalence of the Gonzaga family, Bonsignori's works produced while serving the Duke of Mantua are unified in terms of theme and content, focusing on portraits of the noble family and altarpieces. Francesco Gonzaga kept Bonsignori busy, as seen from the consecutive production of portraits by Bonsignori for Gonzaga family members. In 1494, Bonsignori was engaged to make a portrait of Francesco Gonzaga's daughter, one-year-old Eleonora Gonzaga (c. 1493–1550), who was later the Duchess of Urbino. In 1495, he produced a portrait of another Gonzaga child, the future Cardinal Ippolito. During the same year, Francesco Gonzaga commissioned a painting to display his military capability and leadership as the leader of Italian force and commemorate his victory against French king Charles Vlll in Fornovo on 6 July 1495. Two months after the war, Bonsignori travelled to Fornovo with Gonzaga's court architect Bernardino Ghisolfi (c. 1483–1511), so that he could accurately depict the physical contours of the battlefield in a large-scale fresco, which would be displayed in the family's country palace at Gonzaga, South of the Po River. Bonsignori's Triumph at Fornovo mural, currently lost, was eventually hung in the ""Hall of the Victories"", an audience room decorated with scenes of the Gonzaga family's most important military victories.A chalk drawing of Francesco Gonzaga (National Gallery, Dublin) was executed and signed and dated in 1499. Because of its high quality, it has been attributed to Andrea Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini, both of whom are Bonsignori's early models. It is one of Bonsignori's most vigorous and sympathetic portrayals of a ruler, marking the affectionate and warm relationship between Bonsignori and his lifelong patron, friend, and admirer Francesco Gonzaga. In the same year, Bonsignori produced a portrait of Isabella d’ Este, 4th Marchesa of Mantua, which was delayed by her husband's commission. Isabella d' Este often sent portraits of herself as gifts to her female ""courtiers"". The exchange of portraits among ladies of the court of Mantua symbolized the acceptance into Marchesa's inner social circle and noble status. She referred to Bonsignori as ""maestro (master)"" in her letter exchanged between her and her lifelong friend Margherita Cantelma, Duchess of Sora, showing her satisfaction towards Bonsignori as her portrait painter.In 1506, Bonsignori worked on the Last Supper for the monastery of Francesco de’ Zoccolanti in Mantua. The painting includes Federica Gonzaga, 5th Marquese of Mantua kneeling in front of his father Francesco Bonsignori. The chalk drawing of the Young Federico Gonzaga (Albertina,Vienna) is considered to be a preparatory study for this painting. Federico Gonzaga is depicted as being commended to Christ by St. Francis. On the opposite side, two Gonzaga family members, Cardinal Sigismondo Gonzaga (1469–1525) and Eleonora Gonzaga, are praised by St. Bernard. In the same year, another altarpiece, SS Louis and Francis with the insignia of Christ, preserved in the monastery of S Francesco de’ Zoccolanti in Mantua was executed. In 1509, Bonsignori created Portrait of Elisabetta Gonzaga (1471–1526; Uffiz, Florence), and that of Emilia Pia di Montefeltro (1470–1528) (MD Museum, Baltimore). Bonsignori produced countless portraits of the noble family in Mantua. Among the collection of portrait drawings, the majority belonged to the Gonzaga family for use as presents to foreign rulers in all Italian states and princes in France and Germany. Francesco Sforza, Massimiliano Sforza, (Duke of Milan) also commissioned their portraits. Bonsignori usually made monochrome record drawings of his portraits, a collection of which is preserved by his heirs in Verona. After Francesco Gonzaga died in March 1519, his son Federica Gonzaga supported him as his biggest and last patron until Bonsignori's death in July 1519. Among the Veronese painters who worked for the Gonzagas during the 15th century, Vasari highly praised Bonsignori for his talent in portraiture.     Mantegna spent most of his life working for the Gonzaga family as court painter to the Gonzagas. Since he mainly focused on decorating their castles with frescoes in a small town in Mantua, he did not produce many paintings, but still devoted time to his workshop and traditional apprenticeship. Bonsignori was one of his few students in his workshop in Mantua. Bonsignori was already a master with a modest reputation when he came to Mantua and joined Mantegna's workshop in 1490. Between 1491 and 1492, Bonsignori worked as Mantegna's assistant at Marmirolo, Mantua. They collaborated on several works during this period. In 1491, The Napoleon Madonna – Madonna and Child (Philbrook Museum of Art) was painted by Mantegna with Bonsignori's assistance. The provenance of this painting can be traced to the collection of the Palais Royal in Paris. It was sold by Prince Jerome Napoleon is 1872, and was exhibited in Burlington House in 1880 and 1894. Stylistic evidence suggests that Mantegna designed and outlined the composition, and painted the Child and the medallion on the parapet. The composition of the Napoleon Madonna is exactly the same as the Madonna and Child (Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin) which Mantegna completed in his middle period. Mantegna then left the painting unfinished as he was busy with the decorations of Gonzaga palace in the 1490s. His assistant Bonsignori completed the painting. A similar collaboration can be observed in the Portrait of a Warrior in the Widener Collection (Lynnewood Hall, Philadelphia), where Bonsignori executed the portrait while Mantegna designed and painted in his studio. During his apprenticeship under Mantegna, Bonsignori also painted the Head of a Female Saint (Poldi-Pezzoli Museum, Milan), the Portrait of Youth (Metropolitan museum, New York) and the Madonna with four Saints (1490–1510, The National Gallery, London). The facial expressions in the pictures are notably similar to that of the Napoleon Madonna, which signifies the influence of Mantegna on his style. Certain morphological details such as the nose, mouth, and eyes are painted identically in terms of modelling and shape. Less learned and correct in his design than Mantegna, Bonsignori is more modern in his style and his coloring has more morbidezza. He excelled in painting animals, which he was fond of introducing in the background of his compositions. His paintings portraying animals were alleged to deceive dogs and birds, and he was termed ""the modern Zeuxis"" (after an ancient Greek animal painter). One of his pictures representing Saint Louis is preserved in the Brera at Milan. There are some perspective views in the refectory of the church of the Franciscans at Mantua, demonstrating that he was a master of that branch of art.     Because Mantegna's Mantuan portraits significantly influenced Bonsignori's style, the attribution of the Portrait of an Elderly Man (National Gallery, London), produced by Bonsignori during his middle period, confused modern art historians until the 19th century. In the mid-19th century, the portrait was purchased by the Venetian collector Cesare Bernasconi. The subject of the painting was first identified by Bernasconi as Giovanni Cappello, a member of the ancient patrician Cappello family of Venice. His identity was further confirmed by 17th-century family genealogy, as a senator and procurator of San Marco from 1466. Therefore, this painting also bears another name, The portrait of Venetian senator. The elderly man is depicted as a distinguished Venetian Patrician, wearing a black hat, stole and scarlet gown with fur around the neck. Bonsignori integrated innovative elements into a traditional portrait of a nobleman, otherwise typical of contemporary artists in Northern Italy. These elements include a green parapet in the foreground with an illusionistic cartellino and the dark neutral background. The Venetian senator does not directly gaze at the viewer, which creates a distant atmosphere that emphasizes a patrician's dignity and nobleness.  The attribution of a black chalk drawing (Albertina, Vienna) of the same subject has been debated for centuries. The vibrant facial expression, incisive depiction of the man's features, and skillful play on light caused art historians such as Philip Pouncey, David Ekserdjian and Konrad Oberhuber to suggest that the chalk drawing was created by Mantegna as a preparatory study for Bonsignori's use. The chalk drawing is more vibrant than the painting. In addition, distinctive techniques applied by Mantegna in his paintings, such as strong diagonal brushstrokes and the vigorous plasticity of figures are absent here. The execution of linear outlines, tepid evenness and tonal modeling rather suggest the style of Bonsignori. Contemporary sources reveal the steps followed by Bonsignori in his portraiture practice. Letters exchanged between Francesco Gonzaga, 4th Marquess of Mantua and his wife Isabella d’ Este, concerning the portrait of their son proved that the charcoal cartoon was part of Bonsignori's working method before transferring the design to a panel. They praised its high quality: “quello di carbone piu bello che mai vedesti” (""That one in charcoal more beautiful than any you have ever seen."") Vasari also mentioned in his book that Bonsignori habitually kept drawn copies of the paintings, likely to serve as models for new portraits. The carefully executed cartoon of an elderly man in the Albertina may be such a record drawing of The Portrait of an Elderly Man.     The early compositions of Madonna by Bonsignori are Virgin and Child (c.1483, Castelvecchio,Verona), followed by the dal Bovo Altarpiece, depicting the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints, (c.1484, Castelvecchio,Verona). They exemplify the earliest version of representing Madonna and Child, with typical characteristic of formation of arc behind the head of Madonna. The skills are immature, as Bonsignori is still not familiar with linear perspective. He fails to represent haloes and trees in three-dimensional form. The background is desolated and less significant, which is typical of Bonsignori's style in his early period. The painting is also geometrically symmetrical, which restricts the free expression of natural beauty. The modelling of the drapery on Onophrius, Jerome, Bishop Saint and Altobella Avogadro is plastic and hard. The facial expression of Madonna is gentle and warm, which differentiates Bonsignori from other painters in the 15th century, such as Andrea Mantegna, Giovanni Bellini and Alvise Vivari, who painted Madonna with solemnness and impassiveness. The Napoleon Madonna features the last step of evolution in Madonna paintings, as well as progression of Bonsignori's skills. The Madonna and child are sitting on the parapet, which suggests the influence of Mantegna's style. The Madonna and Child (Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin) concentrates on human figures before a dark, neutral background featuring a garland of fruit. Contrarily, Napoleon Madonna gives an impression of freedom as there are abundant spaces on all four sides of the painting and landscape in the background. The treatment of drapery folds is much softer, indicating advancement in Bonsignori's skills during his middle period. The medallion on the parapet is added to balance the fruits and ribbon, adding symmetry. The Child is painted with coquettish attitude rather than a Mantegnesque distant and severe facial expression typical of Bonsignori's middle period. This sense of freedom and elegance of this composition is typical of Bonsignori's style, and also signifies Mantegna's change of style in his late career. The Virgin and Child with Four Saints (The National Gallery, London) is the best-known of his works featuring Madonna and Child. It was painted between 1490 and 1510, during his undocumented period in Mantua. The saint on the left who is holding a book is Franciscan, while other three saints are not identifiable. According to Vasari, the appearance and position of the group of saints and child are derived from an engraving by Mantegna in reverse, except for the hand gestures of Madonna which is originally created by Bonsignori.    After Andrea Mantegna's death in September 1506, controversy about who would succeed Mantegna as court painter to the Gonzagas arose. Bonsignori, despite being Mantegna's favorite pupil and supported by the Gonzaga family in Matua, was not selected by the Mantuan court to be their court painter. According to Vasari, Bonsignori failed to express his passion and reverence towards antiquity, which was popular among the artists in Mantua as one of the artistic requirements. In addition, Isabella d’ Este, the Marchesa of Mantua, did not appreciate his art. Following Mantegna, Lorenzo Costa the elder succeeded as the court painter of Mantua in 1507. He had a significant impact on Bonsignori's late period style in terms of mood and color. The altarpiece Christ Carrying the Cross (Pal. Ducale, Mantua) created by Bonsignori in 1510 shows the influence of Costa. Use of form and color in St. Sebastian (S Maria delle Grazie, Curtatone) and the Virgin and Child in Glory with SS Blaise, Sebastian, Martial and Juliana (SS Nazaro e Velso, Verona) produced between 1510 and 1519 can be identified as typical of Costa's style. Bonsignori completed his final major work the Adoration of the Blessed Osanna Andreasi (Pal. Ducale, Mantua) in 1519, shortly before his death.       St. Sebastian was locally favored in Mantua in the 16th century. Before Francesco Bonsignori produced St Sebastian (S Maria delle Grazie, Curtatone), his teacher Andrea Mantegna produced three paintings of the subject, commissioned by the Gonzaga family. Bonsignori's ideas were often inspired from life and he conscientiously observed and copied items from nature. As a preparation for St Sebastian (S Maria delle Grazie, Curtatone), he spent four years on observation and execution to achieve naturalistic effects. Vasari mentioned in his book that Bonsignori used a sturdy porter as his model for the natural effect, suggested by his patron Francesco Gonzaga, the 4th Marquess of Mantua.  Only a few of the artists who treated the theme of St. Sebastian actually used real men as their models for their images of the vulnerable saint. By modelling the saint on some fine figure of man, Bonsignori carefully examined the movement of muscle and transfer of weight. There is an anecdote regarding the creation of this work mentioned in Vasari's book. When Francesco Gonzaga first visited Bonsignori's studio, he complained that the bindings of St. Sebastian were minimal and there was no sign of frenzy to loosen them. Additionally, the saint did not show sense of panic expected in a man bound up and shot at with arrows. The figure lacked the power and expression of emotion to transfix the viewer. The next day, Bonsignori sought for a more convincing demonstration of St. Sebastian by trussing up his model. However, he soon sent a secret message to Gonzaga, confessing his failure to understand his will. Gonzaga burst into his studio in the afternoon, furiously waving a crossbow to the porter, yelling ""Traitor! You’re a dead!” Terrified by his attack, the porter manically tried to break the ropes to escape. The fear in the wretched porter's facial expression and physical frenzy ideally replicated the physical and psychological struggle St. Sebastian would experience when he was about to be mortally pierced with arrows. ""There! Now you have him as he should be! I leave the rest to you."" Then the Marquess turned to Bonsignori. Inspired by Gonzaga, Bonsignori recomposed his painting more realistically and naturalistically. Few artists showed the actual end of St Sebastian. St Sebastian (S Maria delle Grazie, Curtatone) was eventually placed in the Mantuan church of the Madonna delle Grazie.         Unlike the Madonna and Child with Four saints (National Gallery, London), Bonsignori is no longer overawed by Mantegna. The Adoration of the Blessed Osanna Andreasi (Pal. Ducale, Mantua) depicts The Blessed Osanna (1449–1505) as a highly esteemed nun, surrounded by three Dominican nuns and two women, including Isabella d’ Este, 4th Marchesa of Mantua in a secular dress, who is kneeling in the left foreground. According to the chalk portrait of donatrix Bonsignori made for this altarpiece (British Museum, London), Bonsignori first drew Isabella d’ Este dressed as a widow, indicating the painting was executed after the death of her husband Francesco Gonzaga on 29 March 1519. The chalk drawing is a preparatory drawing used for the resultant painted piece. The identical details of pose and costume in both drawings prove that they were created by the same artist. The painting depicts her as a younger and prettier woman, with no trace of double-chin as in the chalk drawing. She holds herself upright, showing her elegance and pride as a noble woman. The spontaneity, fluency of lines and the presence of pentimento in her neck and face substantiate that the altarpiece is Bonsignori's original study. The Brief Sanctioning her cult in the province of Mantua was only issued on 20 January 1515. The rays of beatification emanating from the Beata's head implies that the drawing has been executed at least 10 years after her death in 1505. Even though there is a great veneration paid to the Beata from the people before and after her death, this altarpiece is unlikely to be commissioned earlier. Bonsignori focused on the facial expression and gestures of figures, rather than architectural element and natural landscape with narrative details in the background. The detailed depiction of Osanna's facial features shows us the familiarity Bonsignori had about the figure, who was a venerated spiritual and political advisor of the Gonzaga family for decades. She was also well known for her posthumous intervention in curing Isabella d’ Este's chronic headache in 1507. Her remains were transferred to S. Domenica in the presence of Francesco Gonzaga, showing her close connection with the Gonzaga family. The composition style of this devotional painting is as old-fashioned as Bonsignori's first altar-piece in 1484. Bonsignori died during the cure at Caldiero near Verona four months later. In his last monumental work, Bonsignori achieved a combination of the devotional picture and portrait, which are the genres he dedicated to for his entire career. The Veneration of the Blessed Osanna Andreasi (Pal. Ducale, Mantua) is a work of devotion. Bonsignori tied together elements of mystics, matrons, and monastics, which combined to create a complex pattern. This illustrates the relationship between the holy and the secular, the public and the private devotion. Viewers are compelled to think about the rich and complicated female religious life in sixteenth-century Mantua that the painting aims to show in full. The art is beyond that of a venerated local saint, but an illustrative document of intricate female relationships organized around a body of that saint. The altarpiece can be described as a ""city of women"". In it are lifelong friends bounded by mutual devotion, private worries and popular piety, a mother and daughter, and a daughter with her monastic sisters. Today, the civic museum that occupies the former Gonzaga palace of San Sebastiano houses the painting, yet it was once found in the female Dominican monastery of San Vincenzo. Like so many monasteries of the early period, the monastery was suppressed and later fell into disrepair during the Napoleonic era. Mantua, not unlike most Italian cities, has a modern fabric that is constructed on top of the armature of the medieval and Renaissance city. Some of the female monasteries that made up the city at the time the altarpiece was produced are still surviving until this date as more practical venues like schools or cultural centers. Yet, many others did not withstand the test of time.   "
"Paris Bordone (Paris Paschalinus Bordone; 5 July 1500 – 19 January 1571) was an Italian painter of the Venetian Renaissance who, despite training with Titian, maintained a strand of Mannerist complexity and provincial vigor. [SEP]      Bordone was born in Treviso, but had moved to Venice by late adolescence. He apprenticed briefly and unhappily (according to Vasari) with Titian. Vasari may have met the elder Bordone. Bordone's works of the 1520s include the Holy Family in Florence, Sacra Conversazione with Donor (Glasgow), and Holy Family with St. Catherine (Hermitage Museum). The St. Ambrose and a Donor (1523) is now in the Pinacoteca di Brera. In 1525–26, Bordone painted an altarpiece for the church of S. Agostino in Crema, a Madonna with St. Christopher and St George (now in the Palazzo Tadini collection at Lovere). A second altarpiece, Pentecost, is also in the Pinacoteca di Brera.  In 1534–35, he painted his large-scale masterpiece for the Scuola di San Marco a canvas of The Fisherman Presenting the Ring to Doge Gradenigo (Accademia). However, comparison between this latter painting and the near-contemporary, and structurally similar, Presentation of the Virgin reveals Bordone's limitations, his use of superior perspective which creates dwarfed distant perspectives, and limited coloration relative to the brilliant tints of Titian. Bordone also painted smaller cabinet pieces, showing half-figures, semi-undressed men and women from mythology or religious stories in a muscular interaction despite the crowded space. He frequently combined portraiture with allegory.Paris Bordone subsequently executed many important mural paintings in Venice, Treviso and Vicenza, all of which have perished. In 1538 he was invited to France by Francis I, at whose court he painted many portraits, though no trace of them is to be found in French collections, the two portraits at the Louvre being later acquisitions. On his return journey he also worked for the Fugger palace at Augsburg, but again the works have been lost.

[SEP]    The son of the painter Božidar Vlatković of Slano, he was probably born in Kotor (Montenegro) around 1460. He was mentioned in 1475 as a fresco painter at the Rector's Palace and in 1476 as a pupil of painter Petar Ognjanović, whose workshop in 1477 was based on the doctrine of Venice. He was a hard-working and greatly sought-after man, as can be seen from numerous documents and contracts kept in the Dubrovnik archives. Monasteries like the Franciscans in Cavtat and the Dubrovnik Dominicans commissioned works from him, as did noble families and individuals and some churches. After a long stay in Italy, he reappears in Dubrovnik in 1494, where he and his father concluded an agreement for polyptych on Gradić's altar in the Dubrovnik Dominican church. Only four paintings are still in existence from his entire career: a triptych on a side altar in the Bumdevič Chapel of the Dominican monastery in Dubrovnik, The Annunciation in the art gallery of the Dominican church, the Durdevič family's altarpiece in the capitulary hall of the Dominican monastery, and another triptych in the Franciscan church on Lopud has also been ascribed to him.Some modern author credit Božidarević's work as a part of Croatian art.

"Francesco Giuseppe Casanova (1 June 1727, London – 8 July 1803, near Mödling) was an Italian painter who specialised in battle scenes. [SEP] His older brother was Giacomo Casanova, the famous adventurer, and his younger brother was Giovanni Casanova; also a well-known painter.     He was born in London, where his parents, Zanetta Farussi, an actress, and Gaetano Casanova, an actor and dancer, had a theatrical engagement. It was rumoured that his father was actually the Prince of Wales (who shortly after became King George II); whether for scurrilous motives or publicity is unclear. They returned to Venice when he was still young and, after his father's death in 1733, he and his siblings were placed in the care of the Grimani family.His career began in the workshops of Giovanni Antonio Guardi, a very unpleasant time for him, according to the memoirs of his brother Giacomo. Later, he moved to the studios of Antonio Joli, who was a set designer for the theatres owned by the Grimanis. This was also, apparently, unsatisfactory and he took up studies with the battle painter, Francesco Simonini. In 1751, upon his brother Giovanni's advice, he went to Paris and became an apprentice of Charles Parrocel. The following year, after Parrocel's death, he went to Dresden and spent a year studying the battle paintings at the ""Gallery of the Electors of Saxony"". In 1758, he returned to Paris and set himself up as a free-lance artist. Success did not come immediately, and his first exhibition was a failure. In 1761, he became a supernumerary member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture and was promoted to full member in 1763. As a result of favourable criticism from Denis Diderot, he began to receive commissions from the aristocracy. Diderot would later express negative opinions about Casanova's work, but his reputation was already made. His fame soon spread eastward and he received commissions from Catherine the Great for the Hermitage, beginning in 1768. Two years later, he produced his four famous ""disaster paintings"", which were purchased by Jean-Benjamin de la Borde on behalf of King Louis XV. In 1771, he exhibited two large canvases depicting scenes from the Thirty Years' War (The Battle of Freiburg and the Battle of Lens) and once again won Diderot's approval.     In 1762, he had married Jeanne-Marie Jolivet (1734–1773) a ballerina with the theatre of the Comédie-Italienne who was known as ""Mademoiselle d'Alancour"". Her professional connections also supplied him with many clients. In 1775, two years after her death, he married the recently widowed Jeanne Cathérine Delachaux (1748–1818). The marriage turned out to be a disaster, so he abandoned her in 1783, aided and abetted by Giacomo. He took refuge in Vienna, under the protection of Prince Charles Joseph de Ligne, who introduced him to Chancellor Kaunitz. It appears that Francesco was almost as extroverted and entertaining as his brother Giacomo, so he quickly became popular at the Viennese Court. In addition to his paintings, he produced designs for tapestries and upholstery which proved very lucrative. From 1770 to 1787, the Royal Beauvais Manufactory used more than seventy of his patterns. Despite his success and his many aristocratic clients, he squandered his money, was perpetually in debt, and died in poverty at his home near Mödling. The year is generally given as 1803, although some sources have 1805 or 1807.   "

There are about a dozen signed paintings by Catena in existence, although only one of these, the Martyrdom of St Christina (1520) in the church of Santa Maria Mater Domini in Venice, can be dated with any certainty, from an inscription on its marble surround.

"Costantino Cedini (1741 – 5 April 1811) was an Italian painter and art professor. [SEP]    He was born in Padua.

His first work was apparently one of four paintings on the history of Alexander and Darius, commissioned by Ferrigo Venier for his family's palace in Dorsoduro (since demolished). He attended the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, where he studied with Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, Giambattista Tiepolo and, primarily, with Jacopo Guarana. In 1775, he joined a boycott against the nude art classes, led by Giambattista Mengardi (1738–1796), who objected to the length of time the models were required to pose. All the participants, including Cedini, were expelled. Despite this, he and most of the others were readmitted, apparently because of pressure from the University of Padua, which supported their position. He later became a Professor there, from 1784 to 1797. Among his students were Giuseppe Bernardino Bison, Giovanni De Min and Lattanzio Querena. He retained his membership in the Accademia after purges conducted by the Archduchy of Austria in 1798. He served as Director in 1802 and was reconfirmed as a Professor in 1804, but Venice became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1805, and after 1807, he was dismissed, as he lacked the necessary Imperial patronage.

His style seems to reflect the work of Padovanino. He painted a St Phillip in Ectasy for the Oratory of the Fillipini, and also painted for the church of the Carità in Udine. He returned to Udine from Vienna after breaking a limb in a fall from a scaffold.    Not much is known about Cosattini's early career.

The painting reflects a link to Padovanino and, to some extent, Palma il Giovane, leading to the conjecture that Cosattini had at some point been an apprenticeship of the two painters or that he had closely followed their work and adopted it into his own style. Cosattini's close stylistic ties with Padovanino are further demonstrated in the seven paintings, thought to be made by Cosattini, that cover the main hall of the Uccellis College of Udine.   "

"Domenico Mancini (born late 15th century, died in 16th century) is an Italian painter of the Venetian mainland, painting in a High Renaissance style. [SEP] Mancini was either a pupil or a close follower of Giorgione and Giovanni Bellini. He was born in Treviso, and is said to have worked alongside Pietro Maria Pennacchi.    Little is known about the painter. He is known for one signed altarpiece, an Enthroned Madonna and Child with Lute-playing Angel, painted in 1511 for the former church of San Francesco in Lendinara He indicates on the painting that he is a Venetian. This work has been called a variation upon Giovanni Bellini's 1505 altarpiece in San Zaccaria, Venice. Other works include a Madonna with St John the Baptist and St Peter in Florence and a Sacra Conversazione in the Louvre. A portrait signed Domenicus is attributed to him. Crowe and Calcaselle erroneously speculated whether Francesco Domenici of Treviso might be the son of Mancini, and also erroneously whether Mancini might be the same painter as Domenico Capriolo, another contemporary Giorgionista of Treviso.

"Domenico Veneziano (c. 1410 – May 15, 1461) was an Italian painter of the early Renaissance, active mostly in Perugia and Tuscany. [SEP]  Little is known of his birth, though he is thought to have been born in Venice, hence his last name. He then moved to Florence in 1422–23 as a boy, to become a pupil of Gentile da Fabriano. He is said to have worked with Pisanello in Rome around 1423–1430. His work was influenced by the style of Benozzo Gozzoli. In a letter from him to Piero di Cosimo de' Medici, dated from Perugia in 1438, where he likewise resided for many years, he mentions his long connection with the fortunes of the Medici family, and begs to be allowed to paint an altarpiece for the head of that house. He was a contemporary with Fra Angelico and Fra Filippo Lippi, since those two artists and himself are known to have valued the frescoes of Buonfigli at Perugia. Between 1439 and 1441 he painted a masterpiece of the Adoration of the Magi. Another masterpiece is considered to be the Santa Lucia de' Magnoli Altarpiece (c. 1445–1447), originally in Santa Lucia dei Magnoli, Florence and now in the Uffizi.  Painted in tempera on panel, the altarpiece displays such an unusual palette for this period that Vasari wrote that it had been painted in oil. Domenico is also known for a round panel of the Adoration of the Magi (1439–1441) which was probably commissioned for the palace of the wealthy Medici family and now in Berlin.  He influenced Andrea Mantegna. Other important works are the Madonna del Roseto in the National Museum of Art of Romania and the Madonna Berenson in the Villa I Tatti in Florence, both dating to around 1432–1437. Vasari alleged that Domenico was murdered by Andrea del Castagno. However, Castagno died c. 1457, four years before Domenico. He worked at the decorations of the Portinari chapel in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence from 1439–1445, and had as his assistants Piero della Francesca and Bicci di Lorenzo. It is certain that whilst employed there he used linseed oil as his medium, since the hospital books of that date make many allusions to this item in his expenses. His latter days were spent in Florence, where he died on May 15, 1461.     The predella included panels with scenes of the saints of the main composition, and a central, double-size Annunciation: the Stygmata of St. Francis and John Baptist in the Desert are currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Annunciation and The Miracle of St. Zenobius are  in the Fitzwilliam Museum of Cambridge, and the Martyrdom of St. Lucy is in the Berlin State Museums.

"Cosroe Dusi (July 28, 1808 – October 9, 1859) was an Italian  painter in the Neoclassical style, active for many years in St Petersburg, Russia, painting mainly sacred and historical subjects. [SEP] Dusi was nicknamed by his contemporaries the ""modern Tintoretto"", for his liveliness of invention and rapidity at painting.    Cosroe was born in Venice. He enrolled in 1820 at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice, where his mentor was the painter Teodoro Matteini, who had also taught the influential Hayez. At the Academy, Dusi studied alongside Michelangelo Grigoletti. After graduating in 1827, the Academy awarded Dusi a room near the school and he exhibited the large historical canvas, The Death of Alcibiades, followed by Paolo and Francesca da Rimini, exhibited in 1831 at the Brera. In 1829 at the annual exhibition of the Accademia, he displayed The Nymph Salmacis seduces the innocent Hermaphroditus, a Virgin and child with St John, and two small paintings depicting scenes from writings of Gasparo Gozzi.  In 1830 he married Antonietta Ferrari, daughter and sister respectively of the sculptors Bartolomeo and Luigi Ferrari. Luigi had also studied at the Academy with Dusi.In Venice, Dusi collaborated in the production of illustrations for books and lithographic series. For the journal of Il Gondoliere, he made a lithographic portrait Leopoldo Cicognara, that was used in Cicognara's obituary in 1834, and was based on a prior oil painting by Ludovico Lipparini. Dusi, along with Grigoletti and Michele Fanoli, completed a series of lithographs depicting various trades of Venetians, published by Galvani. The subjects were mostly genre figures (fishmongers, chimney sweeps, etc.) or portraits (including singers, actors, and dancers). The Museo Correr of Venice has engravings and lithography by Drusi. He also traveled through Monaco, Germany, and Russia. In 1831 he was commissioned to paint the main altarpiece depicting Saints Peter and Paul and another altarpiece of Virgin of the Rosary and St Dominic for the parish church of the same name in Sexten in Tyrol.

For the church of Santa Maria Assunta of Taufers, he painted a Holy Family with young St John the Baptist (1839). Dusi was commissioned to complete the main altarpiece of the Collegiata of Santa Maria Maggiore of the main city of the Dalmatian island of Cherso (now Cres, Croatia). A fire in 1826 had destroyed the ancient Renaissance altarpiece of Andrea Vicentino, depicting The Miracle of the Madonna of the Snow. Dusi attempted to make an accurate copy (1833) of the icon. In 1834 he painted an altarpiece of Saints Filomena, Lucy, and Agatha (1834) for the Venetian church of San Martino.  After the Teatro La Fenice burned down in a fire, Dusri was commissioned in 1837-1838 to paint the sipario (main drop-curtain) for the newly rebuilt theater house. The subject of the curtain was, appropriately, the Apotheosis of the Phoenix, however, by 1854, this curtain was replaced by a more patriotic and nationalistic scene. Drusi also painted screens for the San Samuele theater of Venice and the Nobile theater of Udine. The subject of the latter was Michelangelo presenting the young Giovanni da Udine to the Duke Gonzaga. In 1838, Drusi designed and Francesco Locatelli engraved prints celebrating the visit of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. The subjects were Celebration of the Completion of the Dam of Malamocco and Entry of the Emperor into Chioggia. For an exhibition held in the Venetian Academy to celebrate the visit, Drusi displayed seven works: Romeo and Juliet;  the Communion of St Martin of Tours, (Socrates reproaches) Alcibiades among the Heterae; the Prayers of his bride convince Henry IV to absolve the prisoners of Calais; a Landscape, Portraits of a family, and finally an unspecified sketch for a historical painting.    Dusi had briefly lived in Munich, Bavaria, where he had painted mainly portraits, but around 1840, the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, after visiting his Venetian studio, invited Dusi to St Petersburg. In Russia, he painted portraits of the Grand Duke and members of the imperial family and the court, including General Suhozanet (1842), Kavos (1849), of Feodosiya Tarassova Gromova. His Mary Queen of Scots led to the scaffold granted him membership in the Academy of Fine Arts of St. Petersburg in 1842, another painting of Alcibiades among the Heterae, made him an academician (1843), and finally, his Deposition, obtained him a post of professor (1851). In Russia, he also painted still lifes and landscapes. He participated in the encaustic decoration of the wooden ceiling of the gallery of ancient painting of the Hermitage, depicting the Seasons and antique artworks and buildings, (based on drawings by Georg Hiltensperger). Dusi also painted numerous icons for the Cathedral of Saint Isaac in St Petersburg, later replaced by copies in mosaic, depicting: the Savior and Mary, Mother of God, for the right side of the altar iconostasis, a Last Supper, a Deposition, St Anastasia and St Catherine of Alexandria (1844-1855). He painted for private chapels of the buildings of the capital and country estates. Dusi decorate the ceiling of the Marinsky Theater and two curtains, both lost, one for the Bolshoi theater in Moscow, depicting Ilsolenne entrance of Prince Požorskij into Moscow, and the other, probably for the Alexandrine theater of St Petersburg in 1858. The czar awarded him the Order of St. Anne of third class and the Order of St Stanislaus of third class.    In 1831, Dusi had been made honorary associate for the Venetian Academy, and he had over the years periodically revisited his native Venice. He returned to Venice to stay finally in 1856, and hoped without success, for a professorship in the Academy. The Austrian painter Karl von Blaas was instead named to the professorship.

"Domenico Fetti (also spelled Feti) (c. 1589 – 1623) was an Italian Baroque painter who had been active mainly in Rome, Mantua and Venice. [SEP]    Born in Rome to a little-known painter, Pietro Fetti, Domenico is said to have apprenticed initially under Ludovico Cigoli, or his pupil Andrea Commodi in Rome from circa 1604–1613. He then worked in Mantua from 1613 to 1622, patronized by the Cardinal, later Duke Ferdinando I Gonzaga. In the Ducal Palace, he painted the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes. The series of representations of New Testament parables he carried out for his patron's studiolo gave rise to a popular specialty, and he and his studio often repeated his compositions.In August or September 1622, his feuds with some prominent Mantuans led him to move to Venice, which for the first few decades of the seventeenth century had persisted in sponsoring Mannerist styles (epitomized by Palma the Younger and the successors of Tintoretto and Veronese). Into this mix, in the 1620s–30s, three ""foreigners""—Fetti and his younger contemporaries Bernardo Strozzi and Jan Lys—breathed the first influences of Roman Baroque style. They adapted some of the rich coloration of Venice but adapted it to Caravaggio-influenced realism and monumentality.In Venice, where he remained despite pleas from the Duke to return to Mantua, Fetti changed his style: his formalized painting style became more colorful. In addition, he devoted attention to smaller cabinet pieces that adapt genre imaging to religious stories. His group of paintings entitled Parables, which represent New Testament scenes, are at the Dresden Gemäldegalerie. He influenced Leonaert Bramer. His painting style appears to have been influenced by Rubens. He would likely have continued to find excellent patronage in Venice had he not died there in 1623 or 1624. Jan Lys, eight years younger, but who had arrived in Venice nearly contemporaneously, died during the plague of 1629–30. Subsequently, Fetti's style would influence the Venetians Pietro della Vecchia and Sebastiano Mazzone. His pupils in Mantua were Francesco Bernardi (il Bigolaro) and Dionisio Guerri. He also instructed his sister Lucrina in painting, and her works have sometimes been attributed to him.   "

Artwork of the period is typified by the use of light, bright colors especially gold used in “manuscripts and panel paintings, tapestries and polychromed sculpture”.    Giambono was active as an artist between 1420 and 1462 and was a follower of Jacobello del Fiore (c. 1385 – c. 1439), Gentile da Fabriano (c. 1360- c 1450) Pisanello.   "

"Jacopo Guarana (October 28, 1720 – April 18, 1808) was a Venetian painter of the late Baroque period who was born in Verona. [SEP] He was active mainly in Venice and its mainland territories. In 1750 he completed frescoes for the interior of Ca' Rezzonico and, in 1780, for the church of San Tomà. He also painted for the church of San Teonisto in Treviso and the Villa Contarini in Cinto Euganeo and helped decorate the Villa Pisani at Stra. Other works were completed for the Palazzo Balbi, Palazzo Boldù a San Felice, Palazzo Erizzo a San Martino, Palazzo Michiel del Brusà, and Palazzo Mocenigo a San Stae. Guarana is the last remaining direct heir of the Tiepolesque tradition. He was a founding member of the Venetian Accademia di Belle Arti and is said to have studied under Sebastiano Ricci, then with Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Among his most popular works are the wall frescoes at the concert hall of the Ospedaletto, Venice. By the time he painted a Sacred heart of Jesus and Saints for the church of San Polo, his work would have been considered ""retardataire"", a glimpse of a lapsing past.  His son, Vincenzo Guarana, born in 1742, was also a painter. Pastellist Anna Pasetti was active as a copyist in Guarana's studio.   "
"Vincenzo Guarana (July 22, 1742 –1815) was an Italian painter, active mainly in Venice and its mainland territories.

He completed also portraits and frescoes in the mainland.   "
"Giacomo Guardi (13 April 1764 – 3 November 1835) was an Italian painter from Venice. [SEP] The son of famous veduta painter Francesco Guardi, he continued his father's line of work, though without the same level of renown. The majority of his works are quite small views of only minor artistic interest, more akin to postcards than to his father's grand scenes, but he produced several paintings showcasing a notable level of artistic skill as well. Evaluating his legacy is somewhat complicated due to the frequency with which paintings are misattributed to him.   "
"Giovanni Antonio Guardi (1699 – 23 January 1760), also known as Gianantonio Guardi, was an Italian painter and nobleman. [SEP] Guardi was one of the founders of the Venetian Academy in 1756.    He was born in Vienna into a family of nobility from Trentino. His father Domenico (born in 1678) was a Baroque painter. Gianantonio and his brothers Niccolò and Francesco (also painters), later inherited the family workshop after their father's death in 1716. They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to his brother Francesco Guardi. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. He may have received his artistic training in Vienna, where he is first recorded in 1719, but had established a workshop in Venice by 1730.  Among his first important clients was the connoisseur and collector Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, for whom Guardi created numerous paintings with an Orientalist theme. He produced copies after the work of other artists, as well as a series of originals with Turkish-inspired interiors as easel pictures for private decorations. Antonio Guardi trained his younger brothers Nicolò and Francesco in his workshop, the latter working closely with him as a figure painter before establishing himself as a vedutista in the late 1750s. A founder member of the Accademia Veneziana in 1756, the elder Guardi produced several works for churches in Venice, notably in the Church of the Angelo San Raffaele, as well as decorative cycles for palaces and villas in the city and the surrounding countryside. Francesco Casanova was among his pupils. He died in Venice in 1760.    List of Orientalist artists Orientalism   "

"Jacobello di Bonomo (active 1370–90) was an Italian painter, active in an early Renaissance style. [SEP]  Little is known about his biography, and he appears to be referred to by various authors under different names, such as Jacobello  or Jacometto del Fiore by the abbot Luigi Lanzi.While he apparently trained in Venice, there are no identifiable works there. He is best known for a large and colorful polyptych of the Virgin and Child with 14 Saints (1385), located at Santarcangelo di Romagna.

"Tripo Kokolja  (February 28, 1661 – October 18, 1713) was a painter from the Bay of Kotor. [SEP]  He is chiefly remembered today for introducing the still life and landscape painting into the art of the eastern Adriatic.    Born in Perast, on the Bay of Kotor in present-day Montenegro, Kokolja is believed to have studied art in Venice.  His most important work was a commission from the Archbishop of Bar, Andrija Zmajević, done at the end of the 17th century. This was a cycle of canvases for the church of Our Lady of the Rocks, opposite Perast, based on instructions of Andrija Zmajević. The lower series of paintings depicts prophets and sibyls; above these are the Presentation of the Virgin, the Death of the Virgin, and the Descent of the Holy Ghost.  Above the arch is the Coronation of the Virgin.  The ceiling, too, is painted, divided into 45 sections which depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin interspersed with images of evangelists, Fathers of the Church, angels, and still lifes of baskets of flowers.  These paintings combine certain hallmarks of Baroque technique with a provincial understanding of both drawing and perspective.  They were badly restored by a local Franciscan painter, Josip Rossi, in 1883.  Other works known to be by Kokolja include portraits of Vicko Bujović and admiral Krsto Zmajević, both of which may be seen in the town museum, along with a self-portrait.  A set of wall paintings in Archbishop Zmajevic's palace, done in 1670, is ruined, but is known to have included landscapes. Kokolja moved to Korčula, Croatia towards the end of his life, following the death of his friend Vicko Bujović, dying there in 1713.  Among his later works are paintings for the Dominican church in Bol, on the island of Brač.      "

In 1820 he was in Rome and Naples, and during 1822 and 1825, in Venice, where he became Professor at the Accademia di Belle Arti in 1838, and Professor of Painting in 1848. He died in Venice.  He was facile both in history and portrait paintings. Among his first works was  a Marius besieged by the Cimbri. In 1822, he painted the Oath of the Horatii. In 1835, he painted the doomed Doge Marino Faliero. In 1836, Cain, Madonna Lia, and Torquato Tasso a Sant'Anna. In 1840 he painted The Martyrdom of the Saints of Aquileia (Sant'Antonio Taumaturgo, Trieste) and in 1841, the Death of  Marco Botzaris.He was prolific as a portrait painter; among his subjects were Prince Bacciocchi and his wife Elisa; Professor Giuseppe Barbieri, Count Kraglianovich, Professor Antonio Basoli (Bologna, 1823); Cavaliere Leopoldo Cicognara (1825); Conte Rizzo of Venice; Cesare Rouel; Gioacchino Rossini; Giovanni Contri and his wife Carlotta Felicorri; the two daughter and son of Felice Levi; Marchese Francesco Sampieri and his wife Donna Anna de Gregori di Squillace; Madama Perina Chatelet in Comastri; Signor Giovanni Pirotti and his wife Ginevra Bartolucci; Caterina Magri from Felicori; and Signore Augusto Pevet.

"Johann Liss (also called Jan Lys) (c. 1590 or 1597 - 1629 or 1630) was a leading German Baroque painter of the 17th century, active mainly in Venice.    Liss was born in Oldenburg (Holstein) in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. After an initial education in his home state, he continued his studies, according to Houbraken, with Hendrick Goltzius in Haarlem and Amsterdam. Around 1620 he travelled through Paris to Venice. He moved to Rome around 1620–1622, and his first works there were influenced by the style of Caravaggio. Although his earlier work was concerned with the contrasts of light and shadow, his final move to Venice in the early 1620s modified his style and gave impetus to brilliant color and a spirited treatment of the painted surface. In 1627, he was created an admired large altarpiece, the Inspiration of Saint Jerome in San Nicolò da Tolentino. His loose brushstrokes seem precursor to rococo styles of Guardi brothers. This final style, along with that of other ""foreign"" painters residing in Venice, Domenico Fetti and Bernardo Strozzi, represent the first inroads of Baroque style into the republic. Liss fled to Verona to escape the plague spreading in Venice, but succumbed there  prematurely in 1629. According to Houbraken, he worked day and night on his paintings, so that Joachim von Sandrart felt that his health was at risk and urged him to join him in Rome.His legacy is as a painter of both sensuous mythological and pious biblical subjects, a master of colors and Baroque painting. He was most influential to Venetian 18th-century painters like Sebastiano Ricci, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Giovanni Piazzetta. Joachim von Sandrart wrote in 1675 that ""because he fared well in Venice, he soon returned there ... he died along with many others during the plague that began in 1629.""

"Johann Carl Loth (Baptized 8 August 1632 – 6 October 1698) was a German Baroque painter who spent most of his life in Venice. [SEP] His name is also rendered as Johann Karl, Karel and, in Italy, Carlotto or Carlo Lotti.He specialized in history paintings; generally crowded group scenes. His subjects were typically from classical mythology or the Old Testament.    He was born in Munich, Bavaria. According to the biographer, Arnold Houbraken, he was one of the three grand masters of art named ""Karel"", or ""Carl"" (the other two were Karel Dujardin and Karel Marat, usually called Carlo Maratta).He was the son and pupil of Johann Ulrich Loth and was possibly influenced by Giovan Battista Langetti. He was once commissioned to paint for the emperor Leopold I in Vienna and  worked together with Pietro Liberi in Venice, where he lived from 1663 until his death in 1698. His brother Franz (1639–1710) was also a painter in Venice and Germany and often collaborated with Carl.

"Francesco Maffei (1605 – 2 July 1660) was an Italian painter, active in the Baroque style. [SEP]    He probably trained in his birthplace of Vicenza with his father, and painted mostly in the towns of the Veneto (Venetian mainland). He died in Padua. He is noted for his somewhat provincial stylistic quirks, combining the decorative manner of baroque with visual distortions and nervous brush strokes. His figures often glimmer with imprecise borders; a style which would characterize also the pittura de tocco e di macchia (painting of touch and dots) of the following decades and century. Representatives of this manner came from diverse regions of Europe, and worked in diverse styles, including Ricci, Carpioni, Magnasco, and later Francesco Guardi. The canvases are often crowded with people and vigorous action (see War against the Fallen Angels at the Galleria Brera in Milan). He is known for paintings in Ca Rezzonico in Venice, the Palazzo del Podesta in Vicenza, and in the Church of Santa Maria del Soccorso (La Rotonda) in Rovigo (1644–55). He also painted in the Oratory of San Nicola da Tolentino in Vicenza. He was trained under the Mannerist painter, Alessandro Maganza, yet was influenced by a variety of painters, including Veronese, Jacopo Bassano, Tintoretto, and Magnasco. He is known to have traveled briefly to Venice in 1638, where he would have encountered the then brash new baroque painterly style of Liss, Strozzi, and Fetti. Maffei left Vicenza in 1657 and settled in Padua, where he died of the plague. He influenced a variety of painters, including Andrea Celesti (c1637-1711) and Antonio Bellucci (1654–1727), a mentor of Sebastiano Ricci.    The surname von Maffei or Maffei is a patronymic name, derived from the Germanic personal name Matthäus. The Maffei family is of ancient German origin and, more precisely, in the 8th century A.D. derived from the Germanic tribe of the Franks. In ancient times the Maffei family settled in Verona from Germany.     Maffei's painting of a woman holding a sword and a head in a bowl was analysed by Erwin Panofsky. He suggested that it alludes to both the story of Judith and the story of Salome. However Panofsky concludes that the painting is of a certain ""type"", that there is precedent in Northern Italian of including the bowl of John in depictions of Judith. From this he argues for the use of historical pictorial traditions as evidence for interpreting painting.   "

"Michele Marieschi or Michele Giovanni Marieschi, also Michiel (1 December 1710 – 18 January 1744), also known as Michiel, was an Italian painter and engraver. [SEP]  He is mainly known for his landscapes and cityscapes (vedute), or views, mostly of Venice.  He also created architectural paintings, which reveal his interest in stage design.     Marieschi was born in Venice in 1710 as the son of an engraver, who died when he was eleven. He probably trained either with Gaspare Diziani, or Canaletto, or both.  According to his biography in Pellegrino Antonio Orlandi's  Abecedario Pittorico, published in Venice in 1753, he spent some time in Germany, where he may have worked as a stage designer.  He returned to Venice by 1731, when he is recorded as a scene-painter, and in 1735 he worked on the ""effects"" for the funeral in Fano of Maria Clementina Sobieska, wife of the Old Pretender.  Under the influence of Marco Ricci and Luca Carlevarijs and encouraged by the success of Canaletto in the genre, he started to create capricci and vedute.Between 1735 and 1741 he was registered in the Venetian Fraglia de' Pittori, or painters' guild. One of Marieschi's sponsors at his wedding in 1737 was Gaspare Diziani. Although he initially produced capricci (i.e. fantastic, imaginary landscapes), he later painted more topographically accurate vedute. One of his patrons was the noted collector Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, who bought twelve paintings between 1736–38, including two canvases for 50 and 55 gold sequins respectively. He drew on his scenery painting experience to ""transform his urban views by using an exaggerated perspective that confers the novelty of a capricious invention even on scenes taken from life"".  Michael Levey contrasts Marieschi's style with Canaletto's, noting that Marieschi's use of paint is livelier and fresher.  He had a considerable influence on Francesco Guardi.  In 1741-42 Marieschi published a set of  21 prints of Venice, under the title of Magnificentiores Selectioresque Urbis Venetiarum Prospectus; the title page featured a portrait of Marieschi by Angelo Trevisani.

[SEP]  His name is derived from a panel painting of the Coronation of the Virgin, dated to that year and held in the collections of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.  This and an associated group of other works were previously accepted to be by Paolo Veneziano, however the Gallery does not officially list them as such anymore.  Some authorities have distinguished the paintings from Paolo's output on stylistic grounds; one has even suggested that they may be by Marco di Martino da Venezia, Paolo's brother, who was active from 1335 to 1345 but from whom no documented work is known to have survived.  The two brothers were recorded together in Treviso in 1335 by a local notary, and are known to have resided in the same Venetian parish ten years later.  Other critics have posited a belief that the panels date to an earlier period, and are the work perhaps of Martino, father of the two men.   "

"Giovanni Pietro de Pomis (ca.1565 or 1569/70 – 6 March 1633) was an Italian painter, medailleur, architect and fortress master builder. [SEP]  His works show a marked influence of late-Mannerism.    De Pomis was born in Lodi, Lombardy.  He was apparently a pupil of the Venetian Jacopo Tintoretto.  From 1588 to 1595, before coming to Graz, de Pomis served as the chamber painter to Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria in the Tyrol (not to be confused with Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor who was de Pomis’s subsequent patron). On 25 October 1595 de Pomis married Judith Anna Dermoyen, the daughter of a Dutch court tapestry master. In that same year his son Johannes Baptist came into the world.  He was followed by his sister Elisabeth in 1596.  De Pomis and his wife had a total of 13 children; some of whom died at a young age.  Both sons Johannes Baptist and Johann Nikolaus died in the Long Turkish War. In 1595 the Italian artist was appointed as a court artist under Archduke Ferdinand (later Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor) in the Styrian capital of Graz.  Traveling with his patron to Rome and Loreto and with Ferdinand’s mother, the Archduchess Maria to Spain de Pomis became a close acquaintance of his later principal, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg.  It was likely on this trip to Spain that he made sketches of El Escorial which served as a model for Schloss Eggenberg.  In 1600 the artist was granted his own coat of arms.  In 1601 he was employed as a military engineer in Ferdinand’s retinue in Groß-Kanizsa.

In 1619, he founded the Confraternity of Painters in Graz and was selected to the board of directors.  Ferdinand II bestowed nobility on him on 10 February 1623 in Regensburg.  This confirmation of nobility, also afforded an improvement to the coat of arms and lent de Pomis the title von Truiberg.  The last years of the court artist’s life were marred by a misappropriation of construction funds (1630) and discrepancies with the court chamber.  On 6 March 1633 at the age of 63, after long years of illness,  Giovanni Pietro de Pomis died in Graz, Styria, Austria, and was buried in his own work, the Graz Mariahilferkirche.

"Nicolas Régnier (1591–1667), known in Italy as Niccolò Renieri, was a painter, art dealer and art collector from the County of Hainaut, a French-speaking part of the Spanish Netherlands. [SEP] He is often referred to as a Flemish artist because this term was often used to designate people from the Spanish Netherlands.  After training in Antwerp, he was active in Italy where he was part of the international Caravaggesque movement.  His subjects include genre scenes with card players, fortune tellers, soldiers and concerts, religious scenes, saints, mythological and allegorical scenes, and portraits.  He also painted a few scenes with carnivals.    Régnier was born in Maubeuge. It was previously believed that his birth date was 6 December 1591. Review of his baptismal records has led to the conclusion that he may have been born at least a year earlier. He apprenticed in Antwerp with Abraham Janssens, a Flemish painter who had studied in Rome at the time of Caravaggio and was one of the first Flemish followers of Caravaggio.  It is unclear when Régnier reached Rome. He travelled to Rome via Parma where he is present in 1616–1617.  He is definitely in Rome by 1620 when he is registered sharing lodgings with the Dutch painters David de Haen and Dirk van Baburen, both part of the Northern Caravaggesque movement. He became acquainted in Rome with the work of Bartolomeo Manfredi, an important Italian interpreter of Caravaggio. The German painter and biographer Joachim von Sandrart calls Régnier a follower of Manfredi. Régnier became a member of the household of Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, a rich banker and prominent patron of Caravaggio. He was Giustiniani's official painter and resided during the period 1622–1623 at Giustiniani's palace on the Piazza San Luigi dei Francesi. His duties included the painting of religious and profane subjects.  After marrying Cecilia Bezzi in 1623 he left Giustiniani's household. In Rome Régnier was also in close contact with Simon Vouet, whose interpretation of Caravaggio with its clear light and classical structure would influence him.   By 1626, Régnier had moved to Venice, maybe after first stopping over in Bologna. He was enrolled in the Venetian Guild in 1626. In Venice, he expanded his activities to dealing in antiquities and paintings. In 1634 he was recorded trying to sell paintings to the Duke of Hamilton through an English agent. It is not clear whether as an art dealer he was also selling any of the forgeries, which is son in law Pietro della Vecchia is known to have created.  He was painter to the king of France, as a supplier of paintings purchased by Mazarin. He was often consulted in the period 1661-1667 as an expert to decide on whether artworks were forgeries, especially with respect to drawings. He also befriended the Italian painter Guido Cagnacci. Of his four daughters, Lucretia married the Flemish painter Daniel van den Dyck while Clorinda married the prominent Italian painter Pietro della Vecchia (1605-1678).  His daughters were also painters in their own right and worked with their husbands on commissions. Regnier's only son, Giovanni Paolo, was baptised on 27 October 1639. Régnier's half-brother was Michele Desubleo, an artist working in a very similar style and whose work is often wrongly attributed to Régnier and vice versa.He died in Venice.    His subjects include genre scenes with card players, fortune tellers, concerts, soldiers and carnival scenes, portraits, religious scenes, saints and mythological and allegorical subjects.  Together with the French painter Valentin de Boulogne, Régnier is regarded as a follower of the Manfrediana Methodus, which refers to those artists who interpreted Caravaggio through the prism of Bartolomeo Manfredi's processing of the lessons of Caravaggio. Some of his works are so close to those of Manfredi that they have been wrongly attributed to Manfredi.  Régnier's style is characterised by its pursuit of refinement and elegance, in contrast with the Northern Caravaggisti such as Gerard van Honthorst and Dirck van Baburen, whose art dwells on the more earthy aspects of genre scenes. After his move to Venice, his style became even more smooth under the influence of the Bolognese painters, such as Guido Reni.He painted Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene three times, as well as a number of nearly-nude single figures of Saint Sebastian and John the Baptist.  He painted Mary Magdalene numerous times.   "
"Sebastiano Ricci (1 August 1659 – 15 May 1734) was an Italian painter of the late Baroque school of Venice. [SEP] About the same age as Piazzetta, and an elder contemporary of Tiepolo, he represents a late version of the vigorous and luminous Cortonesque style of grand manner fresco painting.   He was the uncle of Marco Ricci (1676 – 1730), who trained with him, and became an innovator in landscape painting.    He was born in Belluno, the son of Andreana and Livio Ricci. In 1671, he was apprenticed to Federico Cervelli of Venice. Others claim Ricci's first master was Sebastiano Mazzoni. In 1678, a youthful indiscretion led to an unwanted pregnancy, and ultimately to a greater scandal, when Ricci was accused of attempting to poison the young woman in question to avoid marriage. He was imprisoned, and released only after the intervention of a nobleman, probably a Pisani family member. He eventually married the mother of his child in 1691, although this was a stormy union. Following his release he moved to Bologna, where he lived near the Parish of San Michele del Mercato. His painting style there was apparently influenced by Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole. On 28 September 1682 he was contracted by the ""Fraternity of Saint John of Florence"" to paint a Decapitation of John the Baptist for their oratory.  On 9 December 1685, the Count of San Segundo near Parma commissioned from Ricci the decoration of the Oratory of the Madonna of the Seraglio, which he completed in collaboration of Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena by October 1687, receiving a payment of 4,482 Lira. In 1686, the Duke Ranuccio II Farnese of Parma commissioned s Pietà for a new Capuchin convent. In 1687-8 Ricci decorated the apartments of the Parmense Duchess in Piacenza with canvases recounting the life of the Farnese pope, Paul III.    Apparently in 1688, Ricci abandoned his wife and daughter, and fled from Bologna to Turin with Magdalen, the daughter of the painter Giovanni Peruzzini. He was again imprisoned, and nearly executed, but was eventually freed by the intercession of the Duke of Parma. The duke employed him and assigned him a monthly salary of 25 crowns and lodging in the Farnese palace in Rome. In 1692, he was commissioned to copy the Coronation of Charlemagne by Raphael in Vatican City, on behalf of Louis XIV, a task he finished only by 1694. The death of the Duke Ranuccio in December, 1694, who was also his protector, forced Ricci to abandon Rome for Milan, where by November 1695 he completed frescoes in the Ossuary Chapel of the Church of San Bernardino dei Morti. On 22 June 1697, the Count Giacomo Durini hired him to paint in the Cathedral of Monza. In 1698, he returned to the Venetian republic for a decade. By 24 August 1700, he had frescoed the chapel of the Santissimo Sacramento in the church of Santa Giustina of Padua. In 1701, the Venetian geographer Vincenzo Coronelli commissioned a canvas of the Ascension that was inserted into the ceiling of sacristy of the Basilica of the Santi Apostoli in Rome. In 1702, he frescoed the ceiling of the Blue Hall in the Schönbrunn Palace, with the Allegory of the Princely Virtues and Love of Virtue, which illustrated the education and dedication of future emperor Joseph I. In Vienna, Frederick August II, the elector Saxony, requested an Ascension canvas, in part to convince others of the sincerity of his conversion to Catholicism, which allowed him to become the King of Poland.  In Venice in 1704 he executed a canvas of San Procolo (Saint Proculus) for the Dome of Bergamo and a Crucifixion for the Florentine church of San Francisco de Macci.    In the summer of 1706, he traveled to Florence, where he completed a work that is by many considered his masterpieces. During his Florentine stay he first completed a large fresco series on allegorical and mythological themes [1] for the now-called Marucelli-Fenzi or Palazzo Fenzi (now housing departments of University of Florence). After this work, Ricci, along with the quadraturista Giuseppe Tonelli, was commissioned by the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici to decorate rooms in the Pitti Palace, where his Venus takes Leave from Adonis contains heavenly depictions that are airier and brighter than prior Florentine fresco series. These works gained him fame and requests from foreign lands and showed the rising influence of Venetian painting into other regions of Italy. He was to influence the Florentine Rococo fresco painter Giovanni Domenico Ferretti. In 1708 he returned to Venice, completing a Madonna with the Child for San Giorgio Maggiore. In 1711, now painting alongside his nephew, Marco Ricci, he painted two canvases: Esther to Assuero and Moses saved from the Nile, for the Taverna Palace.     He ultimately accepted foreign patronage in London, when he was provided a £770 commission by Lord Burlington for eight canvases, to be completed by him and his nephew Marco, depicting mythological frolics: Cupid and Jove, Bacchus meets Ariadne, Diana and Nymphs, Bacchus and Ariadne, Venus and Cupid, Diane and Endymion, and a Cupid and Flora.  He decorated the chapel at Bulstrode House near Gerrards Cross for Henry Bentinck, 1st Duke of Portland with a cycle of wall-paintings depicting scenes from the life of Christ. George Vertue described the scheme as ""a Noble free invention. great force of lights and shade, with variety & freedom, in the composition of the parts"".  The chapel was demolished in the 19th century,  but oil modelli still exist. Ricci also designed stained glass for the Duke of Chandos' chapel at Cannons. In c.1710-15 Ricci painted the apse in the chapel at the Royal Hospital Chelsea of the resurrection. By the end of 1716, with his nephew, he left England for Paris, where he met Watteau, and submitted his Triumph of the Wisdom over Ignorance in order to gain admission to the Royal French Academy of Painting and Sculpture, which was granted on 18 May 1718. He returned to Venice in 1718 a wealthy man, and bought comfortable lodgings in the Old Procuratory of St. Mark. That same year, the Riccis decorated the villa of Giovanni Francesco Bembo in Belvedere, near Belluno. In 1722 he was one of twelve artists commissioned to contribute a painting on canvas of one of the apostles as part of a decorative scheme at the church of St Stae in Venice. The other artists involved included Tiepolo, Piazetti, and Pellegrini.    From 1724–9, Ricci worked intensely for the Royal House of Savoy in Turin:  In 1724 he painted the Rejection of Agar and the Silenus adores the Idols, in 1725, the Madonna in Gloria,  in Turin in 1726, he completed the Susanna presented to Daniel and Moses causes water to gush from the rock. In October 1727 he was admitted to the Clementine Academy of Venice. Ricci's style developed a following among other Venetian artists, influencing Francesco Polazzo, Gaspare Diziani, Francesco Migliori, Gaetano Zompini, and Francesco Fontebasso (1709–1769).He died in Venice on 15 May 1734.     Ricci made many copies from the works of Paolo Veronese, both of individual heads and of whole compositions. Some of these copies of heads were bought by George III.  The king also bought a painting of the Finding of Moses which his agent, Joseph Smith,  claimed was a Veronese, although this too had been painted by Ricci, either as a pastiche of Veronese's style, or a copy of a work now lost. Ricci painted a supposed portrait of Andrea Palladio, attributed to Veronese and engraved by Bernard Picart for the frontispiece of the first English edition (1715) of Palladio's Four Books of Architecture. According to Rudolf Wittkower, it does not depict Palladio, but rather is entirely the invention of Ricci.    ""Ricci, leaning at first on the example of splendid art of the Veronese, made a new ideal prevail, one of clear and rich coloristic beauty: in this he paved the way for Tiepolo. The painting of figures of the Roccoco to Venice remains incomprehensible in its evolution without Ricci... Tiepolo germinated the work started by Ricci to such a richness and splendor that it leaves Ricci in the shadows...  although Sebastiano is recognized in the combative role of forerunner  ""(Derschau). ""He is the master of a resurrected-fifteenth century style, whose painterly features are enriched with nervous express and, typically 17th century"" (Rudolf Wittkower). Wittkower in his Anthology, contrasts the facile luminous style of Ricci with the darker, more emotional intense painting of Piazzetta. Like Tiepolo, Ricci was an international artist; Piazzetta was local. ""We perceive in him that synthesis of the baroque decorativeness and individualized and substantial painting, that we will see later again in Tiepolo.  On one side the influence of Cortona, directed and indirect, and on the other the observant painting of the hermit Magnasco;  more intense, substantial and freed academic impulses, the airy, shining influences become, to the open air, magical coves, as well as gloomy corners.  A new synthesis that opened wide new painting horizons, even if the scene is not that of a ballet, it is felt like bing in the wonders of the color, in more vibrating, acute, agile accents ""(Moschini). ""At the start of the Baroque..Venetians remained isolated from the outside…from the great ideas of the baroque painting… The Ricci are the first traveling Venetian painters...  and succeed to inaugurate the so-called roccoco rooms of Pitti and Marucelli palaces.""(Roberto Longhi). Ricci ""brought back in the Venetian tradition a wealth of chromatic expression resolved in a new vibrating brilliance brightness…by means of the intelligent interpretation of the Veronese chromatics and of the brushstrokes of a Magnasco-like touch, from the 16th century impediments,  he takes unfashionable positions against ""tenebrous styles"", is against the new Piazzetta – Federico Bencovich. He supplied a valid painterly idiom for ... Tiepolo to use after his defection from the Piazzettism ""(Pallucchini). ""Venice, still more than Naples, collects the Ricci inheritance of the prodigioso trade of Luca Giordano... Sebastiano throws again it, widens he then, refines it for the school of Sebastiano Mazzoni ""(Argan)   "
"Johan Richter or Giovanni Richter (1665–1745) was a Swedish Baroque painter. [SEP]    Richter was born in Stockholm, Sweden. His brothers included  medallist   Bengt Richter  (1670–1735).  He mainly painted  landscapes or veduta of Venice. Around 1710 he traveled to Venice, where he was mentioned as active from 1717.

"Carlo Ridolfi (1594–1658) was an Italian art biographer and painter of the Baroque period. [SEP]    Ridolfi was born in Lonigo near Vicenza.  He was a pupil of the painter Antonio Vassilacchi (Aliense). He painted a Visitation for the Ognissanti and an Adoration of the Magi for San Giovanni Elemosinario in Venice. He copied Tintoretto's Christ Washing the Disciples' Feet in San Marcuola, before it came to the collection of King Charles I of England. Ridolfi's copy still remains in San Marcuola. He was certainly best known, in his own day and ever since, as an author on art. Carlo Ridolfi was also an important collector of drawings, such as Giorgio Vasari. Many of these drawings are conserved in the Christ Church Library (Oxford).  Ridolfi wrote a biography of the Venetian painters in 1648 titled Le maraviglie dell'Arte ovvero, Le vite degli Illustri Pittori Veneti e dello Stato. He also wrote La vita di Giacopo Robusti (a biography of Tintoretto) in 1642. He was awarded the knighthood of the Golden Cross by Pope Innocent X and a chain of gold and a medal of St. Mark by the Republic of Venice, essentially for his books rather than his painting.  Subsequent Venetian chroniclers who have quoted Ridolfi include Marco Boschini, Antonio Maria Zanetti, and Luigi Lanzi. As Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects was  weaker on Venetian painters than Florentine ones, Ridolfi remains an important source for Venetian painting between the beginning of the Renaissance and his own day, although his accuracy is often doubted, and many of his numerous attributions, especially to Giorgione, are no longer accepted: according to Michael Hirst, ""... the enormous number of paintings attributed to Giorgione by Ridolfi gravely weakens his authority"".One purpose of his work was to supply a corrective to Vasari, and just as Vasari ascribes all progress in art to Florentines, Ridolfi attempts something similar for the Venetian tradition, with its closer connection to Byzantine art. He was well educated in the classics, and his style is much given to rhetorical flourishes, classical comparisons and references to poetry, whilst rather lacking Vasari's talent for telling anecdote.  He approached the larger lives in a scholarly fashion, and quoted many documents, often now vanished, that remain invaluable to art historians.  His work gives great insight into the way art was seen in his own day, as well as during the lives of his subjects.He died at Venice in 1658.   "

"Felicità Sartori, later von Hoffmann (c. 1714–1760) was an Italian painter and pastellist. [SEP] Sartori was born in Pordenone, the daughter of a notary. Her uncle was Antonio dall'Agata, an engraver in Gorizia, and it was he who served as her first teacher. It was also he who arranged for her to join the studio of Rosalba Carriera, and she moved to Venice around 1728. Carriera was at the height of her popularity, and it is believed that Sartori, along with her sisters, provided copies of her work for sale. Sartori remained close to her teacher, but around 1741 she was invited to Dresden by Franz Joseph von Hoffmann, councilor to August III. The following year she married him. He died in 1749, at which point her movements become unclear; some have suggested that she remarried and moved to Bamberg, while others have claimed that she was still in Dreden in 1753 and died there in 1760. The surviving works known to be hers are apparently all miniatures, mostly drawn from well-known works by Carriera; it is also recorded that she produced some copies in oil. An early biographer notes that she learned pastel before specializing in miniatures, and the extent of her work in the medium is unclear, although it seems likely that some of those copies in pastel of Carriera's work which survive might be hers. Around 19 miniatures survive in Dresden; all date to her time in that city. A portrait of Sartori by her teacher is held by the Uffizi Gallery.   "

"Andrea Meldolla (Croatian: Andrija Medulić), also known as Andrea Schiavone or Andrea Lo Schiavone  (c. 1510/15–1563) was an Italian Renaissance painter and etcher, born in present-day Croatia, active mainly in the city of Venice. [SEP]  His style combined Mannerist elements, a relative rarity in Venice, with much influence from the mainstream of Venetian painting, especially Titian.    Meldolla was born in the Venetian-ruled city of Zara in Dalmatia, now Zadar in Croatia, the son of a garrison commander of a post nearby. His family was originally from the small town of Meldola, close to the city of Forlì in Romagna. He trained either in Zara or in Venice. Gian Paolo Lomazzo stated, in a book of 1584, that he was a pupil of Parmigianino, but this has been doubted. There are unproven claims that he trained with Bonifazio de Pitati. He worked in fresco, panel painting, and etching (teaching himself to etch by working initially from drawings by Parmigianino). By 1540, he was well enough established in Venice that Giorgio Vasari commissioned him a large battle picture (which the Florentine author mentions in his Lives). Although initially much influenced by Parmigianino and Italian Mannerism, ""he was also a strikingly daring exponent of Venetian painting techniques"", and ultimately combined both in his works, influencing Titian, Tintoretto, and Jacopo Bassano among others. His works ""shocked some contemporaries and stimulated others"". By the 1550s, he had achieved a new synthesis of Raphael and Titian's compositional elements with his own interest in atmosphere, effecting a ""fusion of form with a dense atmosphere in a pictorial fabric whose elements tend to lose their separate indenties"". Sydney Joseph Freedberg describes Meldolla as well adapted to the Mannerist vocabulary, and that while he was ""able to invent a Venetian Maniera...he was strangely uncreative in the more ordinary workings of artistic invention."" Later in the 1550s, ""occasionally, the sensibility - too receptive, almost feminine - that inclined Schiavone towards imitation brought him to the verge of echo of the larger personality"" (Titian).  Other works have attributions disputed between him and Tintoretto.  Few of his paintings are documented; this may be because, as Vasari states, he mostly worked for private clients. Richardson also insists on his importance as an etcher: ""In etching he was similarly innovative. His technique was unlike that of any contemporary: unsystematically he used dense webs of light, fine, multidirectional hatching to create a tonal continuum embracing form, light, shadow, and air. His etchings are the only real equivalent in printmaking of later 16th-century Venetian painting modes, and his technical experiments were emulated by 17th-century etchers such as Jacques Bellange, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and Rembrandt"". Meldolla died in Venice in 1553.   "
"Felice Schiavoni (1803 – 1881) was an Italian painter, depicting history, genre, and portraits. [SEP] During his early career, he often collaborated with his father, the painter Natale Schiavoni.

He was awarded a prize and medal by Emperor Nicholas of Russia. He often painted in Venice for Russian patrons. Among his works are a Death of Raphael Sanzio painted during a period of 15 years for Emperor Alexander II of Russia, and for which he was paid 60 thousand Lire. The large canvas was an scholarly tour-de-force which included 16 portraits of famous Italian artists, assembled to grieve at the bedside of the dying painter, including Pierin del Vago, La Fornarina, Giulio Romano, Andrea Navagero, Cardinal Pietro Bembo, Ludovico Ariosto, Michelangelo, and Benvenuto Cellini.He also painted a Miracle of St. Anthony of Padua and a Saints Simon Stock and Anthony of Padua for a church in Trieste; a Raphael and the Fornarina for the Tosi Gallery, Venice ; a Cupid for the Brera Gallery in Milan; a Christ bearing the Cross ; a Christ Asleep; a Torquato Tasso reading to Eleonora; a Repose in Egypt (1824); a Venus and Cupid (1832); a Madonna (1854) ; a Raphael painting the Fornarina (1861); and a Holy Family (1864).

Schiavoni was born in Chioggia, near Venice, and is claimed by Perkins to be a distant descendant of Andrea Schiavoni's, the Venetian painter. In Venice, he trained with Francesco Maggiotto and later came under the influence of the Neoclassicism.    He was peripatetic, traveling in 1800 to Trieste, and in 1810 to Milan, where he painted Eugène de Beauharnais and the royal family. In Milan, he was able to frequent the studios of Appiani, Longhi, and Sabatelli. In 1816, Schiavoni was invited by the Austrian emperor to Vienna, to become the official portraitist for the court.

He is often referred to also as  Antonio de Solario or Antonio da Solario, He was possibly born and probably trained in Venice, and signed the Withypool Altarpiece ""Antonius Desolario, Venetus 1514""; this includes a donor portrait and the heraldry of the London merchant Paul Withypool.  This work and other references to works in England by John Leland a few decades later are the evidence for his putative English visit.  The altarpiece is in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery who own the main panel; the wings have been loaned by the National Gallery, who also have a Virgin and Child. There is a similar but smaller panel of the Madonna and Child with a Donor in the National Museum of Capodimonte at Naples. All include charming small landscapes seen through windows in a wall behind the figures. He is first recorded at Fermo in 1502, and last (rather questionably) in Montecassino in 1518; if this last is excluded his last known date is 1514.  In Naples, his main work were twenty large frescoes illustrating the Life of St Benedict in the cloister of the monastery of Santi Severino e Sossio (now the State Archives), which are open to the elements though covered and are now greatly decayed; they present a vast variety of figures and details, with dexterous modeling and coloring. These were painted in the first years of the century. Sometimes Solario's color is crude, and he generally shows weakness of draughtsmanship in hands and feet. His tendency is that of a naturalist the heads lifelike and individual, and the landscape backgrounds better invented and cared for than in any contemporary.His works are sometimes confused with those of his contemporary, Andrea Solario, a Milanese follower of Leonardo da Vinci. While not related to this painter, Antonio probably met and was influenced by Andrea. The portrait of Charles II d'Amboise in the Louvre, who now attribute it as a copy of a work by Andrea, is a case in point.Unfortunately, the only biography of Solario written by a local personage, was penned by Bernardo de' Dominici (1683–1759), the ""Neapolitan Vasari"", who wrote an often confused and error-ridden Vite dei Pittori, Scultori, ed Architetti Napolitani. It states that Solario was born in about 1382, probably in Abruzzo. He is called the son of a tinker, and, after a romantic interlude, became son-in-law of Colantonio, the leading artist in the mid-15th century Naples.  Dominici claims Solario died in 1455.  The erroneous chronology was not clarified until the twentieth century.      "
"Giovanni Squarcina (September 11, 1825 – 1891) was an Italian painter. [SEP]    Squarcina was born in Zadar, Croatia.  During his youth, his natural inclination for painting, was challenged by his father, who intended his son to become a jeweller. At 17 years, his mother took him to Venice, where he began studies at the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts from 1842 to 1848. He was sent to Rome on a government stipend. Returning to Venice he completes a massive (19 by 13 feet) canvas: The abjuration by Galileo Galilei before the Tribunal of the Inquisition. This work, which took ten years to complete, and proved hard to sell. He also completed small paintings and portraits. His paintings were lauded at Expositions of Fine Arts at principal cities of Italy. At the 1881 Mostra of Fine Arts in Venice, he exhibits: Un villanella abbigliato da festa and a portrait of Garibaldi. In the same year at Milan: L'Orgia. At the 1888 Exposition at Bologna, he exhibits: Parasole.   "
"Guglielmo Stella (1828 - 1888) was an Italian painter and writer, active in a Realist style. [SEP]    He was born in Milan. He did not attend a particular academy or have any specific mentor, but was self-educated and drew from eclectic sources. He was equally eclectic in subjects he painted or wrote about. He was am artistic collaborator to the journal of La stampa in Venice. He was also correspondent del Monde lllustré and of Tour de Monde of Paris, along with Enrico Castelnuovo and Alessandro Pascolato. Stella also served as director of the Arte del Mondo Illustrato of Turin and spent some time in Paris.  Camillo Boito said of Stella: Stella bests all in the subject of depth and in comic wit. Few painters in Italy as he know how to  discover in ridiculous things, their pathetic face of things, and in pretentious things, their comical face: he is a subtle revealer of social hypocrisy and of the old prejudices: he is an elegant moralist. His brush is now satirical, and now sentimental, and he is not infrequently sermonizing, like (the playwright) Gaspare Gozzi. He is addicted to paint in large dimensions, but still makes the effort in every part, though minute, to bring life-like rendering; but of this science he is inclined to abuse, and looking overpowers the details of the things, he seems a little dry in the design and raw in color.  Among his works are An indiscreet scene; A captured peasant;  In the sacristy ; and The saltimbanco at the bed of his dying wife. In 1870, he exhibited at the Italian Exposition of Fine arts in Parma: The Saintly murmurs and I preparativi per un ballo in maschera. In 1887, at the National Artistic Exposition in Venice: Fiori di rupe and Pax. Regarding the painting ""Vice and virtue, which was also titled An Episode of the Carnival of Venice, one contemporary critic said: It shows up in a family, poor but not destitute, and contrasts the carefree attitude of a husband and good household virtues of his wife... This painting captures one of those gradations of social relationships that escape the eyes of a common observer, but Stella knows how to capture with such assurance and reveal the passionate and happy requests of the heart, and the ill reply of society. Yet the qualities of form and color disappear under the force of philosophical thought, which dominates the composition and grabs the viewer's attention. Oh, if artists  thought this way always! Stella was knighted into the Order of the Crown of Italy. He also became Consigliere Comunale to the council of Venice. In his official positions, he vigorously opposed the projects involving large demolitions that planned for Venice, by comparing the theories used in the renewal of Naples.

For nearly twenty years, he taught figure and industrial decorative composition.   "
"Lambert Sustris (c. 1515-1520 – c. 1584) was a Dutch painter active mainly in Venice. [SEP] The works Sustris completed in Italy exhibit either a Mannerist style or qualities that may be deemed proto-baroque. He is also referred to as Alberto de Olanda (Albert of Holland). He was born in Amsterdam, and only came to Venice when over 40 years old. His training is unknown, but he was utilized by the studio of Titian for the depiction of landscapes. He accompanied Titian on his trips to Augsburg in 1548 and 1550–1551, and there executed portraits. Returning to Venice, he was influenced by Parmigianino and Andrea Meldolla. He was a teacher to Girolamo Muziano. As the Muziano scholar, Patrizia Tosini has noted, Sustris' works, via his pupil Muziano, are a significant means by which a mid-sixteenth century Venetian interest in landscape and its role as a backdrop for historical subjects spread to Rome in the mid-to-late sixteenth century. His son was Friedrich Sustris.   "
"Francesco Tacconi (fl. 1464 – 1490) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active in Cremona in the 15th century. [SEP] He and his brother, Filippo Tacconi, executed several frescoes in a loggia in the Palazzo Pubblico of their native city. In 1464 their fellow-citizens exempted them from all taxes on account of these frescoes, which have since, however, been whitewashed over. In 1460, Francesco was employed in St Mark's Basilica in Venice, where he painted, on the organ doors then in use, with Epiphany, Resurrection, and Assumption. These paintings, though much damaged, are still preserved, and are said once to have been signed and dated.   "
"Margherita Terzi was a Venetian pastellist of the eighteenth century. [SEP] Terzi was related to the Bolognese painter Cristoforo Terzi. She is recorded as having been a pupil of Rosalba Carriera, who in 1752 gave the sum of 200 ducats ""alle due sorelle Margherita e Maria Terzi"". Her work was known as well to the English pastellist Catherine Read, who in correspondence with Carriera dating to 1756 sent compliments to Terzi and offered to provide her with more paper.   "
"Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo (August 30, 1727 – March 3, 1804) was an Italian painter and printmaker in etching. [SEP] He was the son of artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and elder brother of Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo.     Domenico was born in Venice, studied under his father, and by the age of 13 was the chief assistant to him. He was one of the many assistants, including Lorenzo, who transferred the designs of his father (often executed in 'oil sketches). By the age of 20, he was producing his own work for commissioners. He assisted his father in Würzburg 1751–3, decorating the famous stairwell fresco, in Vicenza at the Villa Valmarana in 1757, and in Madrid at the palace of Charles III from 1762–70.   "
"Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo (8 August 1736 – August 1776) was an artist and son of the more famous Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.

"Girolamo di Tiziano (from having been a scholar of Titian and an assistant to him in some of his less important works), also known as Girolamo Dante or Girolamo Dente, flourished at Venice from 1550 to 1580. [SEP] It is said that in copying the originals of his master, he attained so high a degree of excellence, that such of his pieces as were retouched by Titian, bid defiance often to the judgment of the most expert connoisseurs. He also produced works of his own design; the altar-piece attributed to him at San Giovanni Nuovo, representing SS. Cosmo and Damianus, reflects credit on the school to which he belonged. He was born and died in Ceneda. An Adoration by the Magi is found in the Museo Civico of Feltri.   "

"Alessandro Leone Varotari (4 April 1588 – 20 July 1649), also commonly known as Il Padovanino, was an Italian painter of the late-Mannerist and early-Baroque Venetian school, best known for having mentored Pietro Liberi, Giulio Carpioni, and Bartolommeo Scaligero. [SEP] He was the son of Dario Varotari the Elder and the brother of painter Chiara Varotari, who accompanied him on his travels and assisted with his work.    Born in Padua, from which his nickname derives, he was the son of the local painter and architect Dario Varotari the Elder, who most probably provided his earliest training. Early paintings such as The incredulity of St. Thomas, Virgin and Child, and the Pentecost show the influence of Titian. Padovanino married Caterina Mesa 1612 in Padua. He moved to Venice in 1614. He is known to have traveled to Rome twice (in the mid-1610s and in 1625), where he was much employed in producing copies of major paintings by major Renaissance artists of the prior generation. In 1619 he worked on the mosaics of the Basilica of San Marco. In the following years he worked on decorating the interior of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. In 1625 he made another trip to Rome. He painted a major battle canvas entitled The victory of the Carnuti (Celts) over the Normans. His pupils included Pietro Liberi, Bartolomeo Scaliger, Pietro della Vecchia, Giulio Carpioni and his own son, Dario Varotari the Younger. His sister Chiara Varotari was a well known portraitist. Among his students was Caterina Tarabotti.    Padovanino was a highly respected artist in his time. Although he had earned much of his fame due to his talents as a copyist, he still deserves a place in the history of painting. He had learned painting in the style of Titian, to whose spirit and style he was faithful throughout his career. His career lasted well into the seventeenth century. His paintings are characterized for their narrative ability and their sensuality. Padovanino's paintings 		 		 		 		 		 		   "
"Antonio Vassilacchi (Italian pronunciation: [anˈtɔːnjo vassiˈlakki]; Greek:  , romanized: Antonios Vasilakis; 1556–1629), also called L'Aliense, was a Greek painter, who was active mostly in Venice and the Veneto. [SEP]    Antonio Vassilacchi was born of Greek descent on the island of Milos, Greece in 1556. He left very young to settle in Venice.  In 1572 Vassilacchi became a pupil of Paolo Veronese and began working on the frescoes in the episcopal palace at Treviso, in the church of Sant'Agata in Padua (Padova), and various churches in Venice. His opportunity came with the great conflagration that nearly devoured the Doge's Palace in Venice in December 1577. Aliense, a compatriot and just a little younger than El Greco, was one of the painters commissioned to decorate the restored Palace. Vassilacchi became a member of 'The Brotherhood of Saint Nicolas of the Greek Nation' (Scuola dei Greci), one of the liveliest 'foreign' communities in Venice, in 1600. In its book of members, the secretary inscribed, between a Cephallonian and a Cypriot, ""Ant. Vassilachi: 1600:"".  He was also a member of the Brotherhood of Venetian Painters from 1584 and had acquired a sobriquet, 'Aliense'. The name derives from the Latin alienus, meaning stranger, alien, foreign, and was presumably given to Vassilacchi because of his completely alien, that is non-Italian (and not simply non-Venetian), origin. Vassilacchi married three times.  The name of his first wife, who bore him his son, Stefano, is not known. Stefano followed in his father's footsteps as a painter and is said to have helped him on the Coronation of Baldwin of Flanders.    He died young, however, before having established a career. Vassilacchi also had two daughters who entered the Nunnery of Santa Chiara (for which Vassilacchi had painted an Annunciation), though it is not known whether they were from his first or second marriage.  His second wife, Giacomina, made her will on November 2, 1609, and died six days later. Vassilacchi's last marriage was his most unfortunate. Carlo Ridolfi, his biographer and student, describes a painting by the artist in which he portrays himself carrying his wife, her nurse, her uncle and her son by her previous marriage, on his back.  Vassilacchi used to show this picture to his friends and say ""This is the burden I'll bear till I die"". Aliense died on Easter's eve, 1629, in his seventy-third year.  He was buried with honours in the church of San Vitale two days later. San Vitale is the church on the same square as Vassilacchi's house and he had painted there, a few years earlier (and both aptly named), a Resurrection' and an Ascension. His entry in the official Venetian register reads: 1629, 15 April. Sire Antonio Aliense, painter, aged about 73 years, sick of fever and catarrh these twelve days past. Among his pupils was Tomasso Dollobella.   "
"Cesare Vecellio (c. 1521 – c. 1601)  was an Italian engraver and painter of the Renaissance, active in Venice. [SEP] He was the cousin of the painter Titian. Like Titian, he was born in Cadore in the Veneto. He accompanied Titian to Augsburg in 1548, and seems to have worked as his assistant. Many of Cesare's pictures were ascribed, perhaps knowingly, to Titian. In the Milan Pinacoteca there is a small Trinity by Cesare. He died in Venice. The crude woodcuts for book assembling contemporary fashion from across the world, De gli Habiti Antichi e Modérni di Diversi Parti di Mondo published in Venice in 1590 by Cesare as if they were his works, may in fact belong to Christopher Krieger from Nuremberg. They depict the garb, sometimes fanciful and imagined, of individuals, men and women, from Tsars to Tribeswomen from the Arabian Desert to Muscovite nobles to Arabian nobles to Inca nobles.Cesare also published a book of prints depicting the jewels of royal crowns, titled Corona delle nobili e virtuose donne (1591). Cesare's brother, Fabrizio di Cadore or Ettore, was little known beyond his native place, for the Council-hall of which he is said to have painted a fine picture. He died in 1580.

"Francesco Vecellio (c. 1475–1560) was an Italian painter of the early Renaissance, best known as the elder brother of the painter Titian. [SEP] In his youth, he was a soldier. As a painter, he was mainly active in 1520-1530s in Cadore. In 1524, he signed an altarpiece for San Vito in Cadore. In 1540s, he painted a polyptych at Candide. In late 1540s he painted the organ shutters of San Salvatore in Venice. He painted an Annunciation for San Nicola di Bari, now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, along with Madonna and Child with Saint Jerome and Saint Dorothy (Glasgow).    Francesco Vecellio debuts in the video game Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy and appears again in Assassin's Creed: Memories. In the game, he is featured as an Assassin training under the Master Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze. After he retires from the Brotherhood, he takes up the job of a painter, although he would not be as successful as his younger brother Titian.   "
"Marco Vecellio (1545–1611) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. [SEP] He was also called Marco di Tiziano, since he was Titian's nephew. He was born and active mainly in Venice. He accompanied his distinguished uncle in the journeys to Rome and Germany. He was the favorite pupil of Titian, and approached nearer to his style than any other member of the family. There are several pictures by him in the Doge's palace, among the best an allegory in the ante-chamber to the Sala del Gran Consiglio. Another good example is a picture in the Sala della Bussola, Doge Leonardo Donato before the Virgin and Infant Christ. He also painted for churches at Venice, Treviso, and in the Friuli, among other things a Christ fulminating the world, and The Virgin on Earth Sending the Two Founders Dominic and Francis for the church of San Zaniopolo at Venice. He left some able productions in the ducal palace, the Meeting of Charles V. and Clement VII. in 1529; in S. Giacomo di Rialto, an Annunciation; in SS. Giovani e Paolo, Christ Fulminant. A son of Marco, named Tiziano (or Tizianello), painted early in the 17th century.   "
"Bartolomeo Veneto (active 1502–31) was an Italian painter who worked in Venice, the Veneto (the mainland), and Lombardy. [SEP] During his time in Venice, he studied under Gentile Bellini. The little information available about Bartolomeo's life has been derived from his signatures, dates, and inscriptions. His best-known works are portraits or pictures with portrait-like character. Bartolomeo's later works, and especially those done on commission in Milan, indicate an influence from the artist Leonardo da Vinci.    Bartolomeo’s early works consist of small devotional pictures. Bartolomeo changed his subject matter to suit his patrons as the interest in portraiture grew in Venice and the Veneto. His portraits became quite popular and in his later life Bartolomeo obtained many commissions in Northern Italy.    While forty paintings are generally accepted to be by Bartolomeo, only nine bear inscriptions with the artist's name. A fourth of the generally accepted works are devotional paintings, which were painted during his early career. All of his paintings were done on wood (few were later moved to canvas.) He appears to have received no public commissions and the majority of his work consists of portraiture.    Bartolomeo’s earliest dated work, Virgin and Child from 1502, bears an interesting signature important to our understanding of the painter’s developing style, ""Bartolamio mezo venizian e mezo cremonexe"" (“Bartolomeo half-Venetian and half-Cremonese.”) The inscription sheds light on the painter’s citizenship, as well as a reference to his diverse stylistic influence. The Venetian half reflects his knowledge of Bellini. The Cremonese suggests some knowledge of the Cremonese school founded by Giulio Campi. Another inscription is found on a similar Virgin and Child. The inscription is difficult to read and the date is unknown. What is left is ""7 April 15... bartolamio s...o de z...be..."" It is assumed that Bartolomeo inscribed the painting to indicate that he was a pupil of Gentile (Zentile) Bellini.    Bartolomeo is very likely to have been ""Bartolomeo da Venetia"" who the Este court recorded as a craftsman in its service from 1505 to 1507. There, Bartolomeo gilded frames and made carnival decorations along with painting a Virgin with saints.    Flora from c. 1515 is currently attributed to Bartolomeo. The unknown figure is painted with hard edges and a descriptive quality. Though the sitter is unknown, she is thought (and perhaps wrongly) to be Lucrezia Borgia. Close to a genre painting, the painting could be a response to similar paintings by Giorgione including the Laura. Bartolomeo placed the figure in front of a black background, a theme that would follow in his later paintings such as Saint Catherine, Salome with the Head of the St. John the Baptist, and Lady playing a Lute. Documents suggest Bartolomeo went to Padua in 1512 and Milan in 1520. Leonardo da Vinci had recently been to Milan, where he transformed the current mundane portraiture into one of intrigue and sfumato. Leonardo's effect is evident in Bartolomeo's developing style when juxtaposing Flora and Lady playing a Lute. Flora's hair is flat and each detailed single strand is painted, much detail is paid to the flowers and jewelry draped across her body. Lady Playing a Lute's figure is more three-dimensional with an emphasis of chiaroscuro. Her hair, rather than individual strands, has some sense of being whole while still being separate.  		 		 		    Bartolomeo's signed works have been recorded since the 16th century. However, it wasn't until the nineteenth century that interest arose in the collection of his works. The mid-nineteenth century saw sales of Bartolomeo's works to prominent museums. Alexander Barker, a collector of Italian paintings, acquired (along with paintings attributed to Titian and Giorgione) a painting by Bartolomeo. He later sold the painting to Baron Meyer Amschel de Rothschild and eventually the painting ended up in the Timken Museum of Art in San Diego. In the same year, the National Gallery acquired a portrait by Bartolomeo. In 1871 four of Bartolomeo's works were given to the Louvre. At the very end of the nineteenth century, in 1899, Adolfo Venturi published the first article about the painter.   "
"Paolo Veneziano, also Veneziano Paolo or Paolo da Venezia (active by 1333, died after 1358) was a medieval painter from Venice. [SEP] He has been called 'the most important Venetian painter of the 14th  century'.  Many signed and dated works of this artist are known.  He was regarded as the official painter of the Venetian Republic.     He was born to a family of artists.  He operated a large workshop in which he worked together with his sons Marco, Luca, and Giovanni. He was the official painter of Andrea Dandolo, for whom he and his sons Luca and Giovanni painted the Pala Feriale or “weekday altarpiece”, of the St Mark's Basilica in Venice.Paolo was in the past identified with the artist responsible for the works attributed to the Master of the Washington Coronation.  There is no longer unanimity among art historians regarding this identification.    Paolo's style was indebted to Byzantine influences but also betrays a knowledge of contemporary painting in Rimini.  His more advanced works show the influence of gothic art. Through his art he was the founder of the Venetian school which would exert its influence throughout the 14th century and in particular on Lorenzo Veneziano.   "
"Giorgio Ventura (also Zorzi Ventura) was an Italian mannerist painter of the Venetian school, active mainly in Venice, Istria and Dalmatia at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries. [SEP]     At present, almost nothing is known about his life, except what written from the cartouche of one of his most famous paintings, a Madonna and Child with Saints Sebastian and Roch, held in the parish church of Izola in which he wrote Zorzi Ventura Zaratino in Capodistria Pingieva 1603. Born probably in Zadar, Dalmatia in a year unknown, most likely the second half of the 16th century, he left only one painting across the Dalmatia: the Virgin with Six Saints in the small church of the Franciscans on the island of St. Paul, near Zadar. Traditionally it is believed that its activities in Venice and Istria had begun in 1598 when he signed and dated an Ultima Cena now kept in the parish church of Fažana.  In 1607 he signed his latest Istrian work: the Concert of St. Cecilia in the church of St. Cecilia of Vabriga (close to Poreč). He is no more mentioned in the following years. Ventura knew and studied Vittore Carpaccio and Girolamo Santacroce. The architecture and the background of the paintings of Izola and Villa Decani suggest the knowledge of other painters of the Venetian tradition.   "

He was one of the artists chosen by Bellini to value Giorgione's frescoes in the Fondaco dei Turchi in 1508, and in 1515 worked under his master in the Hall of Council in the Doge's Palace. It seems highly probable that he was identical with Vittore Belliniano.   "
"Alvise or Luigi Vivarini (1442/1453–1503/1505) was an Italian painter, the leading Venetian artist before Giovanni Bellini. [SEP] Like Bellini, he was part of a dynasty of painters. His father was Antonio Vivarini and his uncle, with whom he may have trained, was Bartolomeo Vivarini. Another uncle, on his mother's side, was the artist known as Giovanni d'Alemagna, who worked with his brother-in-law Antonio. Alvise may have trained Jacopo de' Barbari. It has sometimes been supposed that, besides the Luigi who was the latest of this pictorial family, there had also been another Luigi who was the earliest (i.e. Antonio's father), this supposition being founded on the fact that one picture is signed with the name, with the date 1414. There is good ground, however, for considering this date to be a forgery of a later time.The works of Vivarini show an advance on those of his predecessors, and some of them are productions of high attainment; one of the best was executed for the Scuola di San Girolamo in Venice, representing the saint caressing his lion, and some monks decamping in terror. The architecture and perspective in this work are superior.Many churches in Venice have examples. Other works by Vivarini are in Treviso, Milan and the National Gallery, London. He painted some remarkable portraits.The Adoration of Christ dated 1476, in the sacristy of the church of Montefiorentino, is one of his early productions. In 1480 he painted a Virgin and Saints for San Francesco, Treviso, now in the Venice Accademia. To about this date belong the SS. Matthew and John the Baptist, in the same collection; and the fresco of Christ Carrying His Cross in Santi Giovanni e Paolo. In 1488, Alvise Vivarini wrote a letter to the Signory of Venice, requesting permission to share with Bellini in the commission to decorate the Hall of Great Council in the Doge's Palace. To this he received a favorable reply, and thereupon executed two paintings, which were burned in the fire of 1577. The subjects, Vasari tells us, were Otho promising to mediate between Venice and Barbarossa and Barbarossa receiving his Son. The Council were so pleased with the pictures that, in 1492, Alvise was named Depentor in Gran Conseio, with a salary of five ducats a month. Notwithstanding this work for the State, he continued to paint altar-pieces for private patrons. The Apotheosis of St. Ambrose (1503) in the Cappella Milimesi of the Frari, Venice, was probably the last production of Alvise, as the inscription tells us that it was completed after his death by Marco Basaiti, one of his pupils.

"Antonio Vivarini (Antonio of Murano) (active c. 1440 – 1480) was an Italian painter of the early Renaissance-late Gothic period, who worked mostly in the  Republic of Venice. [SEP] He is probably the earliest of a family of painters, which was descended from a family of glassworkers active in Murano.  The painting dynasty included his younger brother Bartolomeo and Antonio's son Alvise Vivarini.    He initially trained with Andrea da Murano, and his works show the influence of Gentile da Fabriano. The earliest known date of a picture of his, an altar-piece in the Accademia is 1440; the latest, in the Vatican Museums, 1464, but he appears to have been alive in 1470.  He collaborated with his brother in law, Giovanni d'Alemagna (also known as ""Joannes de Alemania""), who sometimes has been regarded as a brother (Giovanni of Murano). No trace of this painter exists of a date later than 1447. After 1447 Antonio painted either alone or in combination with his younger brother Bartolommeo. The works of Antonio are well drawn for their epoch, with a certain noticeable degree of softness, and with good flesh and other tints.  He was probably influenced by Mantegna, and worked with him in the Ovetari Chapel in 1450–51. It is sometimes difficult to assign authorship for works from the Vivarini studio. Three of his principal paintings are the Enthroned Madonna Virgin with the Four Doctors of the Church, the Coronation of the Virgin and Saints Peter and Jerome. The first two (in which Giovanni co-operated) are in the Venetian academy, the third in the National Gallery, London.   "

"Antonio Zanchi (Italian pronunciation: [anˈtɔːnjo dˈdzaŋki]; 6 December 1631 – 12 April 1722) was an Italian painter of the Baroque, active mainly in Venice, but his prolific works can also be seen in Padova, Treviso, Rovigo, Verona, Vicenza, Loreto, Brescia, Milano, and Bergamo, as well as Bavaria. [SEP] He was born in Este and trained with Francesco Ruschi. His masterpieces were the canvas on the Plague of Venice painted for the Scuola di San Rocco and the ceiling on the Crowning of the Virgin Mary with St. Girolamo Miani (1703) in the Patriarchal Seminary of Venice, next to the Church of Santa Maria della Salute. He also painted a number of canvases for the Venetian church of Santa Maria del Giglio. Among his pupils were Francesco Trevisani and Antonio Molinari.   "
"Filippo Zaniberti (1585–1636) was an Italian painter of the late Mannerist period. [SEP]    He was born in Brescia and active in Venice, where he became a pupil of Santo Peranda.

"Francesco Zugno (Italian pronunciation: [franˈtʃesko dˈdzuɲɲo] c. 1708–1787) was an Italian painter of the Rococo period who had a successful career in Venice. [SEP]    Francesco Zugno was born in Venice in 1709 and probably died there in 1787. The Zugno were an ancient Venetian family and its members included artists such as the fifteenth century painter Giambattista Zugno. The Brescia branch of the Zugno family also includes a Zugno Francesco (1574-1621) with whom the artist who is the subject of this entry is sometimes confused.  Few details about his life are known. He trained at the Academy of Painting and Sculpture of Venice. When he entered, on the advice of his father Zugno Faustin, in the workshop of Giambattista Tiepolo around 1730, Francesco already had a solid training as a painter. As a disciple and collaborator of Tiepolo, he realized between 1730 and 1737 several paintings. Amongst others, he collaborated with Tiepolo on the frescoes for the Palazzo Labia. He received his first commission for paintings for the convent church of San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice.Among his masterworks is a series of wall frescoes of figures in quadratura balconies, works that were part genre, part courtly conceit. He later completed a fresco cycle for the Villa Soderini-Berti, in Nervesa near Treviso. He was strongly influenced by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and his works. He was a founding academic of the Accademia of Venice.He was married in 1742. The Venetian painter Alessandro Longhi, who knew him well, said Zugno was inclined to melancholy and loneliness.   "
"Titian is an impact crater on the planet Mercury. [SEP] In an enhanced color image, viewed from the MESSENGER spacecraft, the smooth floor of Titian is a brighter orange color than the surrounding area, likely due to being filled with volcanic material. Ejecta from Titian appear blue and cover much of the surface surrounding the crater. This material was excavated from depth during the crater’s formation. Later impacts, such as the one that produced the small crater that appears yellow in the upper center of the image, excavated material from below the Titian ejecta. This yellow-appearing material was present at or near the surface before the impact that created Titian and is a different composition (and thus, color) from its surroundings.Titian is located to the southwest of the large basin Homer.

"The Annunciation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master  Titian, executed between 1559 and 1564. [SEP] It remains in the church of San Salvador in Venice, for which it was commissioned. Originally three paintings were commissioned by the D'Anna family for their chapels in the church of San Salvador in Venice, northern Italy. Only two out of the three remains in place in the church. The other pieces that were commissioned were a Transfiguration dated around 1560, as the altarpiece of the high altar, and a Crucifixion now in the Church of San Domenico, Ancona. The painting depicts the scene when the Virgin Mary being told that she is carrying the child of God, called the Annunciation of the Virgin.    The lower figures are Mary (mother of Jesus) and Gabriel. Mary is in shown in a degree of shock but Titian using his colours brings out the sight of the angel. This is most evident in his handling of light. A heavenly light pours from an opening in the sky into the place of the Annunciation.There have been opinions on the different usage of colour in the painting from Giorgio Vasari to Charles Hope. Hope's opinion ”disliked use of the muddy colours, the physical types, the mannered pose of the Virgin or the badly drawn figure of Gabriel and the inept use of gesture”. Hope's observation is an extension from Vasari's criticism. While Bohde explains that ""muddy colours"" and the physicality of the figures makes the composition of Titian's Annunciation so good. Bohde says, ""Titian’s painting ultimately deals with the transformation of the immaterial into the material, which is the core of the incarnation theme"". The figures itself explains the main theme of incarnation of God within the Virgin. This theme comes thought with the dove in the back that pours out amounts of light from the clouds. The figures are different from other versions of the story annunciation in other Venetian works Titian does not connect to the myth of the city of Venice founded on the day of Annunziata. As Bohde states ""Titian merely connects the place of the Annunciation with the interior of San Salvador through the red and white tiled floor and the row of columns. But these features mainly serve to unify the pictorial and the real space, and are not significantly Venetian.""The overwhelming size of the angel compared to the Virgin and the brush strokes being more expressive shows the theme of incarnation. Titian’s way of depicting the Virgin showing the flesh is more full in her bosom. Making the flesh of the virgin more evident, puts emphasis that Jesus was made from the Virgin's flesh.   "
"The Assassination of Saint Peter Martyr was a 1528-1529 oil painting by Titian, originally painted on panel and later transferred to canvas. [SEP] It was destroyed in a fire at Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice in 1867, though a 1691 copy by Johann Carl Loth hangs in its place.        In 1528 Titian took part in a competition with Il Pordenone and Palma il Vecchio for the commission for a large altarpiece showing the martyrdom of Saint Peter Martyr for the altar of that saint's confraternity in San Zanipolo, the main Dominican centre in Venice. Titian won the commission, in part since the Dominicans did not want to be outdone by the Franciscans, who already had Titian's Assumption and Pesaro Altarpiece, both at the basilica dei Frari. The new work was delivered on 27 April 1530.  The 17th century biographer Carlo Ridolfi described how the artist would specifically return to Cadore to study the effect ""of distance on the mountain peaks where, the white and vermillion aurora disappearing, the sun began to rise little by little, streaking the blue sky with gilded strokes, having removed that view of the Cenedese mountains which he could see from his own home"". Pietro Aretino's letter to the young sculptor Niccolò Tribolo records Tribolo and Benvenuto Cellini's reaction to the painting on a trip to Venice. Vasari's Lives of the Artists states of it ""[the work] is more complete, more celebrated and more great than any other [work] Titian produced in his whole life, the one showing the best understanding and technique"". The work was a major influence on later artists, such as the figure of Saint Matthew in Caravaggio's The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and the red-cloaked Roman soldier on the left of Annibale Carracci's Resurrection, which are based on Titian's figures of Peter and the fleeing brother respectively.    Early in the 17th century the Dutch merchant Daniel Nys tried in vain to buy the work, even after offering 18,000 ducats. In 1797, after the French occupiers suppressed the monastery, the work was taken to France, where it was transferred from panel to canvas, then a common procedure there. It was returned to Venice in 1816 as part of the restitution project personally headed by Antonio Canova. There it was placed in the Madonna del Rosario chapel rather than on its original altar. A fire completely destroyed the chapel and the painting on 16 August 1867. Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle wrote ""no other work more victoriously demonstrated the extraordinary power of that mind - this loss is irreparable for art."". One of the last people to see the work before the fire was Gaetano Milanesi:  of this painting, one can repeat what has been said about [the same artist's] Assumption - that it is one of the most beautiful [paintings] in the world Along with copies of varying sizes, media and quality and a pen study (15,7x28,9 cm) in the Wicar Museum in Lille, two blurry black and white photographs survive of two fragments saved from the fire and taken to Switzerland for restoration, though the fragments themselves are lost..

"The Averoldi Polyptych, also known as the Averoldi Altarpiece, is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Titian, dating to 1520–1522, in the basilica church of Santi Nazaro e Celso in Brescia, northern Italy. [SEP] It is signed  ""Ticianus Faciebat / MDXXII"" on the column of the panel showing St. Sebastian.    The work was commissioned by Altobello Averoldi, papal legate to Venice, from Titian during the period when he was the official painter of the Republic of Venice. The work was delivered in 1522, as indicated by Titian's signature in the lower right panel. The large polyptych was placed behind the high altar of the church of Santi Nazaro e Celso of Brescia, replacing another altarpiece by Vincenzo Foppa (of which now a Nativity of Jesus remains in the church of Santa Maria Assunta at Chiesanuova, as well as two side panels in the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo). At this time Brescia formed part of Venice's mainland possessions. A first version of the St. Sebastian panel was offered to Duke Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara in compensation for Titian's late completion of his  Bacchanalia. The Duke declined the offer, and the early St. Sebastian was perhaps sent to Mantua, where one such painting is mentioned among the works of art sold by the Gonzaga to Charles I of England. Its whereabouts after that are unknown.Averoldi subsequently also started to complain about Titian's late delivery.    The use of a compartmentally-divided polyptych, a solution that must have been rather old-fashioned for the time, is likely to have followed a specific request from Averoldi. In any event, Titian managed to produce a certain degree of unity, although not spatially or architecturally, unlike 15th century polyptychs. Instead, the Veneto-born painter adopted a chromatic-dynamic, with a sense of light converging towards the central scene.The panels are:  Resurrection of Christ, 278x122 cm Saints Nazarius and Celsus with Donor, 170x65 cm Saint Sebastian, 170x65 Angel of the Annunciation, 79x65 cm Annunciation of the Virgin, 79x65 cmThe work inspired several Renaissance painters from the Brescia area, including Savoldo and Moretto    The central scene depicts a triumphant risen Christ, high above, in a dark yellow and grey dawn sky. He holds aloft the banner of the Crusader saint, St. George, as an emblem of the Christian Catholic church. Beneath him is a group of armour-clad soldiers. The work shows the influence of works by Raphael, such as the  Transfiguration (the centripetal position of Christ) and the fresco of the Deliverance of Saint Peter for the quasi-night atmosphere. Another possible influence that has been suggested here is that of Danube school, in details such as the dramatic lighting effects on the landscape. A depiction of the ideal Jerusalem in the background was a Northern European fashion.    The left panel show the saints Nazarius and Celsus, to whom the church housing the altar was dedicated, on a gloomy background. Nazarius wears shining armor,  his disciple, Celsus, behind him. The kneeling donor, Altobello Averoldi, the papal legate to Venice, is portrayed in profile, stylistically reminiscent of the depiction of Sigismondo de' Conti in Raphael's Madonna of Foligno. The influence of Giorgione, who before his death in 1510 had worked with Titian, may be discerned in the calm atmosphere and the dull colors.    The right-hand panel shows a traditional Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, although in this case the saint is depicted in a rather contorted position. This may be derived from Michelangelo's Punishment of Aman on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, or from Raphael's Fire in the Borgo also in the Vatican. The saint's arms are tied to a tree trunk at different heights; the legs are also differently articulated because Sebastian's right foot rests on a section of a fallen stone column.  It has been suggested that the saint's face resembles that of the risen Christ in the central panel. Some resemblance has also been claimed to Titian himself; he was 30-years-old at the time.In the background of this panel is an announcing angel. His gaze is directed towards Sebastian and to Saint Roch whom she is attending: prayers to both saints were invoked as a protection against the plague, and Roch's uncovered legs show the characteristic lesions. Two preparatory drawings of the panel exist: one (16.2 x 13.6 cm) is at the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin, and another (18.3 x 11.5 cm) is in the Städel in Frankfurt.    The two upper panels make up an Annunciation, with the announcing angel on the left and the Virgin on the right, according to a tradition dating from the Middle Ages. Titian represented the two figures in strong light, in particular the angel, which is illuminated from behind. His figure is unrolling a cartouche with the Gospel words Ave Gratia Plena, the salutation of the archangel Gabriel to the virgin Mary.    List of works by Titian   "
"Balbi Holy Conversation (Italian: Sacra conversazione, also known as Titian Madonna and Child with Sts Catherine and Dominic and a Donor) is an oil painting by the Italian late Renaissance painter Titian, dated to around 1513, and now held at the Fondazione Magnani-Rocca in Traversetolo, near Parma, northern Italy. [SEP] The work was originally part of marquess Balbi's collection at Genoa, hence the name. It is a work from the artist's youth, set in an open landscape, with some Giorgione influences but already some personal elements, such as the asymmetrical composition and the full figures.   "
"The Birth of Adonis is a c.1506-1508 oil on panel painting attributed to Titian, now in the Musei civici in Padua. [SEP] It shows the birth of Adonis from Ovid's Metamorphoses, forming a pair with The Legend of Polydoros. It originated as part of a cassone, which entered its present home as a legacy from Emo Capodilista in 1864. Then attributed to Giorgione, it was later reattributed as an early work by Titian. Some art historians have also suggested an attribution to Romanino. At the centre is a group of figures freeing the child Adonis from his mother, who has just been transformed into a tree. To the left is a pair of lovers (referring to Adonis' conception), whilst on the left is his future lover Venus.   "
"The Bravo is an oil painting usually attributed to Titian, dated to around 1516-17 and now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. [SEP]  The painting can be seen as one of a number of Venetian paintings of the 1510s showing two or three half-length figures with heads close together, often with their expressions and interactions enigmatic. Most of these are ""Giorgionesque"" genre or tronie subjects where the subjects are anonymous, though the group includes Titian's The Tribute Money, with Christ as the main figure, which in terms of style is similar to this painting, and his Lucretia and her Husband, also in Vienna, where at least the woman's identity is clear, if not that of the man.Alternative attributions are to Giorgione (in the past) and Palma Vecchio.       Against a dark background two male figures are shown, one in front of the other, with the rear one looking over his shoulder at a foreground figure who is tapping his shoulder, making him turn sharply. This foreground figure is dressed in armour and his other hand hides a dagger or a sword of which we see only the hilt, suggesting an attack is imminent. The rear figure is a young man with flowing blonde hair, wearing a garland of vine leaves on his head, who has also reached for his weapon, the hilt dimly visible at bottom centre. The foreground figure has his head turned away from the viewer. Various attempts have been made to assign the scene to a specific incident in myth or history.  One suggestion is the arrest of Bacchus's follower Acoetes by Pentheus, king of Thebes, which would explain the wreath of vine-leaves in his hair.  An x-ray of the painting showed that the head of the man on the right (the foreground figure) once wore a crown.    The painting was probably in the Venetian collection of Zuanantonio Venier in 1526, who had one then described as ""two half-figures attacking each other by Titian"".  In 1636 it was sold to the Duke of Hamilton, who brought it to London.  Most of his purchases were from the collection of Bartolomeo della Nave, who perhaps had it by then. After Hamilton's execution, it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, whose collection later became part of the Habsburg imperial collection in Vienna, then passed to the Kunsthistorisches Museum.  An etching after a reduced copy by David Teniers the Younger shows the painting attributed to Giorgione. The painting must have been a popular painting when it was in the Archduke's cabinet, as it was portrayed in some of his gallery paintings by Teniers. The work was attributed to Titian by the Italian art historian Roberto Longhi, which remains usual. But for  John Steer the painting was ""surely by"" Palma Vecchio.  		 		 		   "
"Christ Carrying the Cross on his way to his crucifixion is an episode included in all four Gospels, and a very common subject in art, especially in the fourteen Stations of the Cross, sets of which are now found in almost all Catholic churches. [SEP]  However, the subject occurs in many other contexts, including single works and cycles of the Life of Christ or the Passion of Christ.  Alternative names include the Procession to Calvary, Road to Calvary and Way to Calvary, Calvary or Golgotha being the site of the crucifixion outside Jerusalem. The actual route taken is defined by tradition as the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, although the specific path of this route has varied over the centuries and continues to be the subject of debate.     The episode is mentioned, without much detail, in all the canonical Gospels: Matthew 27:31–33, Mark 15:20–22, Luke 23:26–32 and John 19:16–18.  Only John specifically says Jesus carried his cross, and all but John include Simon of Cyrene, who was recruited by the soldiers from the crowd to carry or help carry the cross. Modern scholars, following descriptions of criminals carrying crossbars by Plautus and Plutarch, often take the Gospel description as meaning Jesus, then Simon, carried only a heavy patibulum, the crossbar, to a pole, stipes, which was permanently driven into the ground at Golgotha. However, in Christian imagery Jesus, and Simon, carry the complete cross—both patibulum and stipes. Only Luke mentions the ""women of Jerusalem"", who were in later patristic writings and Christian art taken to include the Three Marys and the Virgin Mary. This meeting was usually located at the city gates, as in the painting illustrated, which is also typical in following Luke and showing Jesus turning his head to speak to them.  The other episodes were later elaborations, with the Veil of Veronica appearing from the 13th century, and the falls of Christ, eventually three, first found in the Late Middle Ages.  Luke mentions that the two thieves were also in the group walking out to Golgotha, but does not say that they had to carry their crosses, and though they may be identifiable among the walking figures, their crosses are very rarely anywhere to be seen in depictions of the group.  Some works, like Raphael's Il Spasimo, Bruegel's Vienna Procession (see below for both), and the London Jacopo Bassano, have the thieves' two crosses already set up at the place of execution in the distant background.Also of relevance is Matthew 16:24, with which St Francis of Assisi began his first Rule of 1221: ""Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me"".  St Francis also used to be led with a cord around his neck as a penitential exercise, the cord being a detail added to many depictions of the episode from two Old Testament passages.  These are Isaiah 53:7: ""He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth"" and Jeremiah 11:19  ""I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter..."", both of which were very frequently cited by medieval commentaries. In medieval typology, Isaac carrying wood up the mountain for his sacrifice is the most common parallel for the episode, and often shown as a complementary scene; this scene is ""Isaac Bearing the Faggots"" (or ""wood"") in traditional art history terminology.    The fully elaborated traditional account of the episode is demonstrated in the Stations of the Cross, where it is divided into a number of incidents, which between them account for most sculptural depictions: Pilate sentences Christ Jesus is given His cross Jesus falls the first time Jesus meets His Mother Simon of Cyrene carries the cross Veronica wipes the face of Jesus Jesus falls the second time Jesus meets the daughters of Jerusalem Jesus falls the third timeTen through fourteen cover the rest of the Passion. It is also one of the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary, and the meeting with Mary the fourth of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin.  The procession is still re-enacted in a number of annual Good Friday processions in Catholic countries, some of which include actors playing the leading persons and a cross.  On the Via Dolorosa such events occur all year round.    Until around 1100, Simon of Cyrene was more often shown actually carrying the cross than Jesus, and from this time the number of other figures typically included in the scene increases.  In Byzantine depictions, Jesus typically walks with his hands bound, and a soldier leading him holding the rope, as Simon carries the cross.  In some early depictions, Jesus and Simon carry the cross together.  In the later Middle Ages, probably influenced by Passion plays, a large crowd of figures may surround Jesus, displaying a great variety of feelings, from contempt to grief. This development culminates in the large landscape of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Procession to Calvary (Vienna).  Although in early and Eastern depictions the cross is not always represented as a heavy burden, and may be held free of the ground by either Simon or Jesus, by the later Middle Ages the cross is always clearly difficult to carry, and the base is dragged along the ground, in line with the increased emphasis in the period of emphasizing the sufferings of the Passion.  From this period Jesus usually wears his Crown of Thorns, which he did not earlier. An early example of a type of devotional image showing Jesus alone is a small panel by Barna da Siena of 1330-1350 in the Frick Collection.  These continued through the Renaissance and Baroque period, with a ""close-up"" half length composition first appearing in Northern Italy around 1490.  Somewhat in contrast to most andachtsbilder, the suffering of Christ is often less graphically depicted in these than in larger scenes where he is mobbed by a hostile crowd.  As triptychs became popular, the scene often occurs as the left-hand wing to a central Crucifixion, with an Entombment or Resurrection on the right-hand wing. From around 1500, the subject became used for single piece altarpieces in Italy, usually showing either the meeting with Veronica or the Swoon of the Virgin or spasimo, when the Virgin swoons, faints, or at least falls to her knees, both fairly recent and rather controversial introductions, without scriptural authority.   "
"The Pastoral Concert or Le Concert champêtre is an oil painting of c. 1509 attributed to the Italian Renaissance master Titian, previously attributed to his fellow and contemporary Giorgione. [SEP] It is in the Musée du Louvre in Paris.    The painting was originally attributed to Giorgione, but modern critics assign it more likely to the slightly younger Titian, as the figures' robustness is thought more typical of his style. It is also possible that Giorgione (whose works included elements such as music, pastoral subjects and the simultaneous representation of the visible and invisible) began the work, and then, after his death in 1510, it was finished  by Titian.The work was owned by the Gonzaga family, perhaps inherited from Isabella d'Este: it was later sold to Charles I of England. When the English royal collections were dispersed following the revolution of 1649, the painting was sold at auction to the German banker and art collector, Eberhard Jabach, who, in turn, sold it to Louis XIV in 1671.The painting was also attributed to Palma the Elder and Sebastiano del Piombo.Édouard Manet conceived his Le déjeuner sur l'herbe (1863) after viewing the Pastoral Concert in a visit to the Louvre museum.    The painting portrays three young people on a lawn, playing music together, while next to them a standing woman is pouring water from a marble basin. Both the women are naked apart from drapes that have fallen to their legs; the two men are dressed in contemporary costume. In the wide background is a shepherd and a landscape. The subject was perhaps the allegory of poetry and music: the two women would be an imaginary apparition representing the ideal beauty, stemming from the two men's fantasy and inspiration. The woman with the glass vase would be the muse of tragic poetry, while the other one would be that of the pastoral poetry. Of the two playing men, the one with the lute would represent the exalted lyric poetry, the other being an ordinary lyricist, according to the distinction made by Aristotle in his Poetics.  Another interpretation suggests that the painting is an evocation of the four elements of the natural world (water, fire, earth and air) and their harmonic relationship.    Fête champêtre   "
"The Crowning with Thorns is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Titian (Tiziano Vecellio) done during 1542 and 1543. [SEP] It is housed in the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France. The painting was commissioned by the confraternity of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. It was brought to France after the Napoleonic conquest of the city in 1797. In The Crowning with Thorns, painted for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, the space is compressed in the scene by arranging the figures on a shallow plane delimited by the wall of a building. There are explicit references to antiquity: the figure of Christ derives from the celebrated Laocoon, an antique statue discovered in Rome in 1506, an archetypal exemplum doloris (""example of pain""). Another famous antique sculptural fragment, the Belvedere Torso, provides the model for the upper body of the torturer on the left. With the inclusion of the bust of Tiberius Caesar, a direct reference to the Roman authorities who condemned Christ, Titian also pays homage to the classical past. This is a brutal scene, in which Christ's tormentors twist the crown onto his head with their canes, but the violence is relieved and Christ's suffering exalted by the beauty of the colours, which especially in the blue and green to the right are colder than usual in deference to Titian's Roman sources. In Christ's foot extended on the steps, however, Titian pulls out all the Venetian stops and one can sense the blood flowing through the veins under the flesh. The pattern of the canes slices through the massed figures like the strokes of a knife, forming a Trinitarian triangle to the right of Christ's head. An inimitable Titian touch is the cane lying unused on the foremost step, still, shadowless and deadly, like a snake.According to Robert Haven Schauffler, the German painter Fritz von Uhde once considered it to be ""the greatest picture ever painted.""

"The Eleven Caesars was a series of eleven painted half-length portraits of Roman emperors made by Titian in 1536-40 for Federico II, Duke of Mantua. [SEP] They were among his best-known works, inspired by the Lives of the Caesars by Suetonius.  Titian's paintings were originally housed in a new room inside the Palazzo Ducale di Mantova.  Bernardino Campi added a twelfth portrait in 1562.   The portraits were copied by Flemish engravers in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, who added engravings of twelve Roman Empresses.  Between 1627 and 1628 the paintings were sold to Charles I of England by Vincenzo II Gonzaga, and when the Royal Collection of Charles I was broken up and sold after his execution by the English Commonwealth, the Eleven Caesars passed in 1651 into the collection of Philip IV of Spain.  They were all destroyed in a catastrophic fire at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in 1734, and are now only known from copies and engravings.    Titian was commissioned in 1536 to paint eleven portraits for the Gabinetto dei Cesari (sometimes Camerino dei Cesari, ""Cabinet of the Caesars""), one room in new suite at the Palazzo Ducale di Mantova designed by Giulio Romano, with décor inspired by ancient history.  The suite, the Appartamento di Troia (""Troy Apartments""), was named after the theme of the main room.  Titian's portraits were inspired by Suetonius's account of the Lives of the Twelve Caesars and informed by Titian's study of ancient medals and busts.  The dimensions of the room allowed three portraits on each wall, but a window on the west wall meant that only eleven painting were included in the decorative scheme.  Titian's portraits were completed shortly before the death of Duke Federico in August 1540.  Romano later added a portrait of the twelfth emperor, Domitian, displayed elsewhere. The emperors were depicted in classical poses, wearing armour and flowing draped clothing, accompanied by various objects such as swords and staffs.  The series ran clockwise around the top of the room, from Julius Caesar on the north wall to Titus on the west wall.  Romano added frescos on the ceilings; stucco and niches to frame Titian's paintings; and a series of further paintings on wooden panels as a dado or basamento around the lower part of the walls, with a scene from the life of each emperor below the relevant portrait.   Some of the works by Romano, or his workshop, designed to hang below Titian's portraits are in the British Royal Collection.Titian's eleven portraits were copied by Bernardino Campi in 1561 for Francesco Ferdinando d'Ávalos, governor of Milan.  To Titian's eleven portraits, Campi added the twelfth Caesar, Domitian, in 1562, after the portrait by Romano.   Campi returned to the subject several times, painting at least another four sets for other patrons. Drawings of most of Titian's originals (but omitting the west wall) were made by Ippolito Andreasi for Jacopo Strada in about 1568.  The portraits were engraved by Aegidius Sadeler II and published in Antwerp in about 1593, and then republished by Marcus Sadeler in about 1625.  Both were court artists to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague.  The engravers added twelve accompanying empresses - eleven wives and Otho's mother, Albia Terentia - based on portraits by Giulio Romano.  Each engraved portrait is accompanied by a poem in Latin. The engravings are an important source for the details of Renaissance armour, including examples attributed to Filippo Negroli.   The Gonzaga collection, including Titian's paintings, was sold by Vincenzo II Gonzaga to Charles I of England in 1628, but Charles's Royal Collection was broken up and auctioned under the English Commonwealth.  The Titian portraits were sold for £1,200 in 1651 and bought by the Spanish Ambassador Alonso de Cárdenas, acting on behalf Don Luis Méndez de Haro, who gave them to Philip IV of Spain.  Titian's portraits were displayed at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, along with other portraits by Titian and Tintoretto, where the Galería del Mediodía (the South gallery) became known as the  Galería de Retratos (Portrait Gallery).  They were lost in the catastrophic fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734   "

"Flora is an oil painting by Italian late Renaissance painter Titian, dated to around 1515 and now held at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. [SEP]    The work was reproduced in numerous 16th century etchings. Later, it followed an unclear series of changes of hands at Brussels and Vienna. In the 17th century, it was sold by the Spanish ambassador at Amsterdam to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and was cited by Rembrandt in his Saskia Dressing as Flora  of London and in two portraits in Dresden and New York. Later included in the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna, it was one of the works exchanged with the Uffizi. In the 18th century, it was erroneously attributed to Palma the Elder.    It portrays an idealized beautiful woman, a model established in the Venetian school by Titian's master Giorgione with his Laura. Her left hands holds a pink-shaded mantle, while another holds a handful of flowers and leaves. The woman was portrayed by Titian in numerous other works of the period, including the Woman at the Mirror, the Vanity, Salome and Violante, as well as some Holy Conversations. The meaning of the painting is disputed: some, basing for example to inscriptions added to the 16th century reproductions, identifies the woman as a courtesan; other consider it a symbol of nuptial love, although her dress is not a dressing one. The identification with Flora, the ancient goddess of Spring and vegetation, derives from the presence of Spring flowers in her hands.   "
"The Gozzi Altarpiece is an oil painting by the Italian Renaissance master Titian, dating from 1520. [SEP] It is located in the Pinacoteca civica Francesco Podesti in Ancona, central Italy.    The painting is the first dated work by Titian. It was commissioned by  Alvise Gozzi, a merchant from Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) who was active in Venice, for the church of San Francesco. The presence of a view of Venice in the background had a political message: in 1510 Pope Julius II had given freedom of navigation and commerce to Ancona at the expense of Venice, but in 1520 the European situation had cancelled this privilege. The presence of the Saints Francis and Blaise, respectively symbolizing Ancona and Ragusa, was thus a hint to their submission of Venice, represented by the Virgin Mary.    The painting depicts the Madonna and Child appearing on a cloud, above a sunset sky with golden, orange and red colors. They are flanked by a clothed cherub and two naked cherubs, who offer Mary laurel crowns. Below are the saints Francis of Assisi, who shows his stigmata, and Blaise, patron saint of Ragusa, who points at the heavenly tableau while he rests a hand on the shoulder of the kneeling donor. The composition was perhaps inspired by Raphael's Madonna of Foligno, although developed according to Titan's more modern and lively style.   "
"The Gypsy Madonna is a panel painting of the Madonna and Child in oils of about 1510–11, by Titian, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. [SEP]  It is a painting made for display in a home rather than a church.It is close to compositions by Titian's former master Giovanni Bellini, especially, when reversed, one of 1509 in the Detroit Institute of Arts, and has been seen as a challenge to the much older master, by taking on a characteristic compositional formula of his.  The style is much indebted to Giorgione, and it was often attributed to him in the earlier 20th century.  This is especially so in the ""harmonious fullness and slow gravity of form"" of the figure of the Virgin, which uses a type of figure Titian did not repeat in later Madonnas.  The landscape is virtually identical to the left-most section of the background of the Dresden Venus, traditionally thought to have been begun by Giorgione, but with the landscape done after his death in 1510 by Titian.The right background is occupied with a cloth of honour, painted with careful attention to its folds (they were often stored folded up).  These were hung behind thrones, as in very many paintings of enthroned Madonnas, and here it implies that an unoccupied throne is out of sight to the right.  The Bellini in Detroit uses the same device.  The composition is therefore a half-way stage between the older more formal enthroned Madonnas and newer compositions with the Virgin and Child shown informally in a landscape setting.  Madonnas by Bellini and his followers had for some time been showing small glimpses of landscape to the sides of the painting, usually cut off by a parapet lower down, and the formula here, using a horizontal ""landscape"" format, develops this.    The ""Gypsy Madonna"" is a 19th-century name for the painting, because of the Virgin's supposed ""dusky complexion  and her dark hair and eyes"".  She seems young even by the standards of Madonnas, and the hands of the Child are unusually engaged, respectively with his mother's fingers and her dress (this is a difference to the Bellini). According to Sidney J. Freedburg, the effect of sensuous existence Titian makes by his command of optical device is of an extreme virtuosity.  No picture before this attains a comparable sense of presences existing palpably within an atmosphere, reflecting coloured light but also absorbing it to saturation point, so that each pore of flesh or drapery makes texture.  Despite the debts to Bellini and Giorgione, the painting shows Titian, who was then around twenty-one, developing his own independent character and style.    Technical examinations show that it was originally even closer to the Bellini in Detroit, and that many changes were made in the course of painting. Unlike Bellini's usual careful underdrawing, Titian ""used as his guidelines only summary strokes made with a fairly wide brush with thin wash shading"".  Among several other changes, the head of the Child originally looked out at the viewer.    Like several other important early Venetian paintings in Vienna, the work was (very likely) in the Venetian collection of Bartolomeo della Nave and in 1636 sold in Venice to the Duke of Hamilton, who brought it to London.  In 1659, after Hamilton's execution, it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria in Brussels, whose collection soon passed to the imperial collection in Vienna.   "
"The Legend of Polydoros or The Forest of Polydorus is a c.1506-1508 oil on panel painting, now in the Musei civici in Padua. [SEP] It forms a pair with The Birth of Adonis - they both formed part of a cassone and were left to their present home by Emo Capodilista in 1864. Then attributed to Giorgione, they are now generally attributed to Titian, though a few art historians attribute them instead to Romanino. Priam ordered his son Polydorus to carry Troy's gold to his step-brother to keep it from the Greeks. At the right of the painting Polydorus is killed en route for the gold, whilst to the left are two women, perhaps Hecuba and a servant. Troy burns in the centre background.   "
"Lucretia and her Husband Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus or Tarquin and Lucretia is an oil painting attributed to Titian, dated to around 1515 and now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. [SEP] The attribution to this artist is traditional but uncertain - the brightened palette suggests it could instead be by Palma Vecchio. However, others identify the painting as part of Titian's series of half-length female figures from 1514 to 1515, which also includes the Flora at the Uffizi, the Woman with a Mirror at the Louvre, the Violante and the Young woman in a black dress in Vienna, Vanity in Munich and the Salome at the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.  There is an early copy in the Royal Collection.Lucretia poised with a dagger, about to commit suicide, was becoming a very common subject in art. However, the addition of a male figure just behind her is all but unique. The Kunsthistorisches Museum now calls this figure Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, Lucretia's husband, but the Royal Collection identifies him as her rapist, Sextus Tarquinius (known as Tarquin), as do most sources. Her husband was present at her death, according to most of the differing Roman accounts of the story, and Tarquin was not. If the figure is intended to be Tarquin, the setting must be the night before, with Lucretia perhaps making her plan. The painting depicts Lucretia about to commit suicide to preserve her honour after disclosing her rape by Sextus Tarquinius the previous night, making her the model of Roman female virtus. Her face looks up to the divine illumination coming from above, giving her the strength to commit the act. As in other treatments of the subject, there are sensual elements, such as Lucretia's falling robe and almost-bared breast. The robe's green is particularly bright, witnessing to the high quality of pigments available in Venice. The painting can be seen as one of a number of Venetian paintings of the 1510s showing two or three half-length figures with heads close together, often with their expressions and interactions enigmatic. Most of these are ""Giorgionesque"" genre or tronie subjects where the subjects are anonymous.   The painting in Vienna, or the other version still in the Royal Collection, may be the painting mentioned by Ridolfi in 1648 as being in the gallery of Charles I of England, whose Italian paintings mainly came from his purchase of the Gonzaga collection in Mantua. The Vienna version might have passed to the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria.   Titian's better known late depiction of Lucretia's rape by Tarquin was completed over 50 years later, in 1571 (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge).    "
"Malchiostro Annunciation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian, completed around 1520, and housed in the Cathedral of Treviso, northern Italy. [SEP] The Malchiostro Chapel, located to the left of the high altar of the Cathedral of Treviso, near the sacristy, was commissioned by Broccardo Malchiostro, secretary of the bishop and humanist Bernardo de' Rossi. Designed by Tullio of Antonio Lombardo, it was completed in 1519 and frescoed by Il Pordenone until 1520. The decoration was completed in around 1523, and this Annunciation was executed by Titian around that period, perhaps with the help of Paris Bordone. The face of the donor was possibly repainted after 1526. Lorenzo Lotto was inspired  by this work for his Recanati Annunciation. The painting depicts the Annunciation in a church with a chessboard pavement. Titian, instead of painting the angel on the left and Mary on the right as usual, moved the Madonna into the foreground with the angel behind, pushed towards Mary by the divine light behind him. At the center, kneeling, is the donor, put in a rather far position from the viewer.   "
"The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is a 1558 painting by Titian, now in the church of I Gesuiti in Venice. [SEP] It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial."
"The Miracle of the Jealous Husband   is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance master Titian, executed in 1511 as part of the decoration of the Scuola del Santo in Padua, northern Italy.It [SEP] portrays a man stabbing his wife after she has been unjustly accused of adultery. When the man discovers the truth, he begs for pardon to St. Anthony, who resuscitates the woman (this scene is portrayed in smaller size on the right). The idyllic background is inspired by Giorgione's paintings. The young Titian, described the volume of the wife's raised arm, in the center of the action, by actually sculpting it in relief rather than describing it illusionistically.   "
"The Pardo Venus is a painting by the Venetian artist Titian, completed in 1551 and now in the Louvre Museum. [SEP]  It is also known as Jupiter and Antiope, since it seems to show the story of Jupiter and Antiope from Book VI of the Metamorphoses (lines 110-111). It is Titian's largest mythological painting, and was the first major mythological painting produced by the artist for Philip II of Spain.  It was long kept in the Royal Palace of El Pardo near Madrid (not to be confused with the Prado, a purpose-built museum), hence its usual name; whether Venus is actually represented is uncertain. It later belonged to the English and French royal collections.  Analysis of its style and composition shows that Titian modified a Bacchanalian scene he had begun much earlier in his career by completing the landscape background and adding figures.  For Sidney Freedburg it was ""probably in substance an invention of the later 1530s, though significantly reworked later; it is full of motifs and ideas that have been recollected from an earlier and more Giorgionesque time, ordered in an obvious and uncomplicated classicizing scheme.""Though, if Antiope is the nude, the painting meets the basic definition of Titian's famous poesie series, mythological scenes from Ovid painted for Philip, the painting is typically not counted in the series, either as it was begun well before Titian used the term in a letter to Philip, or because the nude is indeed Venus, in which case no such scene is described by Ovid.    As to the subject, Titian himself appears to describe it simply as ""the landscape"", and his son Orazio calls it ""the nude woman with the landscape and the satyr"", both in letters to Philip, but later an inventory of El Pardo calls it ""Jupiter and Antiope"".  In Madrid in the 1620s, Vicente Carducho (d. 1638, see below) referred to its subject as ""Antiope and some shepherds and satyrs on a large canvas"".  In the correspondence of the French and Spanish ambassadors as Charles I's collection was being sold in 1649-53, the nude is ""Venus"".  As Malcolm Bull points out, ""In later inventories the terms ""naked woman"" and ""Venus"" are almost interchangeable"", and the presence of her son Cupid an uncertain indicator, as he often appears with other people.     The painting is very large, and the figures somewhat disconnected, the composition divided into two by the tree at centre. In the right foreground we have a scene that would have been familiar to well-educated Renaissance viewers as Jupiter, having taken the form of a satyr, creeping up on the sleeping nymph Antiope, and lifting her drapery to view her naked. He will shortly rape her.  Possibly the situation is only borrowed from this story, but all Titian's other mythological paintings for Philip show scenes from Ovid, where Antiope's story features (Metamorphoses, VI, 110-111).  Scenes of satyr voyeurism or sexual assault, given titles such as Nymph Surprised by a Satyr, are found in art, mostly later than this, but only a very rash satyr would treat the goddess Venus in this way.  The painting can be compared to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians of 1523-24 (Prado), where an apparently unconscious nude in a version of the Dresden Venus pose shares the picture space with a group of revellers in a mixture of nudity, contemporary and classical dress.  Venus or Antiope sleeps as yet undisturbed, not only by the voyeur, but a hunting scene above her, where hounds have brought down a stag, and immediately left of her, a satyr or faun with the legs of a goat seated on the ground, in conversation with a lady in contemporary dress.  Immediately beside them stands a hunter, with large dogs, and at far left another huntsman blows a horn.Over Venus' head, Cupid perches in a tree, with an arrow in his bow, apparently pointed at Jupiter.  In the middle distance a naked couple, apparently both women, talk or kiss on the banks of a river.  The river has a wide waterfall above the stag, and presumably then flows above the conversing couple before perhaps circling round behind the viewer to create the water behind the Jupiter/satyr, but this is not shown clearly, which is rather typical of Titian.  To the right, the landscape includes a contemporary farmhouse at the top of the rise, and a distant settlement dominated by a church tower and steeple.  Distant mountains complete the view, which like many Titian landscapes reflects the country between Venice and his hometown of Pieve di Cadore in the mountains, though he does not seem to have closely depicted specific locations.    Art historians have struggled somewhat in trying to find a coherent meaning for these disparate elements.  Their incongruous combination makes it something of a test case for a long-running dispute over the extent to which Titian's mythological paintings (and to some extent those of Venetian painters in general) carry ""great complexity of allegorical meanings"", in the way that some works of other Renaissance artists are generally accepted to do.Harold Wethey was not impressed by the idea that the different elements represented different modes of life: ""active"" in the hunters, ""voluptuous"" in Venus/Antiope  and Jupiter, and ""contemplative"" in the couple sitting on the grass.  Another line of thinking is to compare Venus to the stag brought down by the hounds, the stag then becoming a cerf fragile, in an old Gothic visual metaphor with the hunted stag representing the life and trials of Christ or man.  This draws on a wealth of imagery in religious writings, ultimately going back to Psalm 41/42: ""As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.."".Alternatively it can be seen as an essentially decorative piling-up of different groups of subject matter with no overall complex meaning intended, but an impressive effect.     The painting is a development of Titian's compositions with a reclining female nude in the Venetian style.  The pose of the Pardo Venus, recalling a Venus pudica pose with one arm covering the genitals, is similar to that in Giorgione's Dresden Venus, which  was completed by Titian after Giorgione's death in 1510.  Around 1534 Titian had painted the Venus of Urbino, and a similar scene from 1545, perhaps a lost recorded Venus sent to Charles V, ""was the basis"" for the Venus and Musician series, which exists in several versions.  Unlike the others, the Cupid in most versions of Venus and Musician, and probably in the Pardo Venus, does allow a clear identification of the female as Venus. However, allusions to the goddess elevate such images from the profane category of  courtesans.Kenneth Clark described the Pardo Venus as a ""laboured attempt to recapture his early style"", and the Dresden/Urbino pose here ""much coarsened"".  A more original composition and physique, also begun in the mid-1540s, but with versions painted in the 1550s and perhaps 1560s, is used in the series of Danaë paintings, which Clark sees as Titian adopting the conventions for the nude prevailing outside Venice; ""in the rest of Italy bodies of an entirely different shape had long been fashionable"".For Clark, the Venus of the Venus and Musician versions, where the head changes direction but the body remains exactly the same, is ""entirely Venetian, younger sister of all those expensive ladies whom Palma Vecchio, Paris Bordone and Bonifazio painted for local consumption.""    In 1574 Titian had still not been paid for the painting, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and favourite Antonio Pérez.  The painting was still in El Pardo when most of the palace burnt down in 1603, with the loss of several Titians and other important art.  Vicente Carducho  (1576/78–1638), an Italian-born court painter in Spain, records that when he heard the news, the first question of King Philip III of Spain was to ask if the Venus had been lost.  Told that it survived, he is said to have commented ""I am satisfied, for the rest will be redone"".Despite this prestige, the painting was given to Charles I of England in 1623 when, as Prince of Wales, he made a quixotic, unauthorized and unplanned visit to Madrid to try to acquire a Spanish bride.  After Charles' execution the valuers assessing his collection in Whitehall Palace found the ""great Lardge and famous peece"" in the ""Second and Middle Privie Lodging Roome"", along with the Venus and Musician now in the Prado, and valued them at £500 and £150 respectively.  They were both bought on the same day in 1649 at one of the sales of Charles' art collection by Colonel John Hutchinson, who paid £600 and £165.  Hutchinson was buying as an investment, and as the major continental collectors realized the situation and organized agents, he sold all his major purchases within a few years.Alonso de Cárdenas the Spanish ambassador, managing purchases in England a year or two later, declined to buy the Pardo Venus, preferring Correggio's Venus with Mercury and Cupid ('The School of Love') (now National Gallery), as ""no es tan profano como la otra, Venus dormido y el Satyro"" (""it is not as profane as the other, Venus sleeping and the satyr"").  In 1653, Hutchinson skillfully negotiated Bordeaux-Neufville, who combined the roles of French ambassador and Cardinal Mazarin's art agent, into paying £1,200 for it. It was acquired from Mazarin's heirs in 1661 by Louis XIV of France, and remained in the French royal collection until this passed to the Louvre Museum.  		 		   "
"The Penitent Magdalene is a 1565 oil painting by Titian of saint Mary Magdalene, now in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. [SEP] Unlike his 1531 version of the same subject, Titian has covered Mary's nudity and introduced a vase, an open book and a skull as a memento mori. Its colouring is more mature than the earlier work, using colours harmonising with character. In the background the sky is bathed in the rays of the setting sun, with a dark rock contrasting with the brightly lit figure of Mary.   "
"Perseus and Andromeda is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian, now in the Wallace Collection in London. [SEP] It was painted in 1554–1556 as part of a series of mythological paintings called ""poesie"" (""poetry"") intended for King Philip II of Spain.  The paintings took subjects from the Roman poet Ovid's Metamorphoses, in this case Book IV, lines 663–752, and all featured female nudes. The painting is in oils on canvas, and measures 175 x 189.5 cm.  It was probably one already described as ""damaged"" in 1605, and has suffered subsequent damages, as well as apparently being cut down along all the sides. Scientific imaging techniques show an unusually large number of changes as the composition evolved.The painting shows the hero Perseus flying through the air in combat to kill the sea monster who has come to kill Andromeda, who has been chained to a cliff by the sea shore for him.  Perseus has already attacked and wounded the monster on the shoulder.The painting is well-travelled; painted in Venice, it was delivered in modern Belgium, then went to Spain, Italy, England, and France before returning to England.     In Greek mythology, the kingdom of Ethiopia was ruled by the beautiful but vain queen, Cassiope; she maintained that her beauty, and that of her daughter Andromeda, was superior to that of the sea nymphs, who were the daughters of Poseidon, the god of the sea. When the nymphs became aware of her claims, they protested to their father, who retaliated by calling up a Cetus or sea monster to ravage the coastline of Ethiopia placing Cassiope's kingdom at risk. On the advice of Jupiter Ammon, the Queen, together with her husband Cepheus, decided to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to the monster.  Perseus, flying back from his killing of the gorgon Medusa, kills the monster and rescues Andromeda, whom he then marries.Titian follows Ovid fairly closely, although it is likely that his Latin was poor, and he mainly relied on somewhat simplified versions in Italian, of which there was a choice. This may explain some of the differences to the Latin original, although Titian may well just have interpreted the story freely.  In Ovid Andromeda's parents are nearby; here they are probably on the shore opposite, by a city. Andromeda stands amid seashells and coral. Coral is mentioned by Ovid, but as being formed from Medusa's locks at a later stage in the story.  Ovid describes Andromeda as looking like a statue, and having been crying; Titian's depiction matches both.  Perseus had been given his curved sword by Mercury, and his shield by Minerva.  Like Mercury, he wears winged boots, and also a winged helmet.Various visual sources have been suggested, both from the rather crude woodcut illustrations of various editions of Ovid, and specific classical reliefs, as well as a well-known drawing by Michelangelo of the Risen Christ (British Museum).  The book illustrations ""all show Perseus wearing a winged helmet like Mercury, for which there is no textual justification, and carrying a small baroque parade shield, features which Titian may later have remembered.""     The first two of the poesie series were Danaë and Venus and Adonis, delivered in 1553 and late 1554 respectively.  Both of these were repetitions with variations of compositions Titian had already painted in the previous decade for the Farnese family in Rome.  In a letter from Titian to Philip accompanying the Venus and Adonis, he noted that the pair offered contrasting poses, and promised ""another different view"" in both Perseus and Andromeda and a Jason and Medea he intended to produce.  These were to be the first original compositions in the series for Philip, but there is no trace of the Jason and Medea, which was presumably abandoned.  Instead The Rape of Europa is designed as a companion to Perseus and Andromeda.The composition of Perseus and Andromeda developed through several stages, which can be traced through x-rays and infra-red reflectography, and a surviving drawing.  Some of the earlier elements can still be seen to the naked eye on close examination of the painting.  At first Andromeda was on the right, in a fairly similar pose, but leaning from left to right as in the final picture.  The arm to the left was raised above her head in a similar fashion, but the other arm more or less horizontal, and the head presumably looking to the centre.  There is a drawing by Anthony van Dyck from his Italian sketchbook (now Chatsworth House) recording such a figure, probably copying a lost drawing by Titian, a rarity by this stage in his career.  When Andromeda was moved to the left of the painting her pose was different from the final painting, more similar to the original one when she was on the right. There were several different positions, some taken no further than underdrawing, for Perseus' limbs, sword and shield.  The monster originally rose higher out of the water.In a dissident view, Rearick sees the Wallace collection canvas as a second version, the original being the one delivered to Philip in 1556, and now lost, with Andromeda on the right. He sees a painting by Paolo Veronese in Rennes as a paraphrase of this version.A few years later, probably by 1558, Titian painted for Philip's aunt Mary of Hungary a St Margaret and the Dragon (now Prado) which, with the removal of Perseus, more clothes, and a cross carried by Saint Margaret, shows much the same situation, with a cliff, the sea, and a city across a bay.    Philip received the painting at Ghent in the Spanish Netherlands in September 1556.  In 1574 Titian had still not been paid, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and favourite Antonio Pérez.  It appears to have left the Spanish royal collection before Philip's death in 1598 (the only poesie to do so), but was replaced by a careful copy, now in Gerona, Spain.  It may have been given to Pérez, as other important paintings were.  This would have been before his drastic fall from favour in 1579.Alternatively it may have been given to the family of the court sculptors Leone Leoni and his son Pompeo, also given paintings by Philip.  The Leoni family may have bought it when the collections of Pérez were dispersed.  There are records of paintings of the subject in the collections of Pérez in 1585–86 (described as ""grande"" or large), of Leon Bautista Leoni on his death in 1605 (""a damaged Andromeda by Titian"") and of his father Pompeo Leoni on his death in 1608 (described as large, and by Titian).  All of these may refer to this painting, but this is not certain.The painting was certainly in the collection of Anthony van Dyck, who may have acquired it from the Leoni family, who were based in Milan, during his years in Italy from 1621 to 1627.  It was listed among his paintings on his death in London in 1641, and bought in 1646 by one of van Dyck's best customers, Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, together with Titian's Portrait of the Vendramin Family (now National Gallery).  Northumberland paid £200 for the pair, and a further £80 in 1656. However, it does not seem to have been owned by Northumberland for long, and was in France by 1654, and possibly by 1649.  In 1654 it was in the Paris house of the politician Louis Phélypeaux, seigneur de La Vrillière, where it remained until 1717, sold with the house in 1705.It then joined the famous Orleans Collection of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France, to be re-united with four others of Titian's poesie, and two other versions by Titian of Venus and Adonis.  By this time only Philip's versions of that and Danaë remained in the Spanish royal collection, and are now in the Prado.  Like most of the rest of the Orleans Italian paintings, it moved to London where the collection was dispersed after the French Revolution in a complicated series of transactions, in some of which it was wrongly described as formerly in the collection of Charles I of England.  In 1798 it was valued at 700 guineas but failed to sell, selling for 310 gn. in 1800, and £362 in 1815.  This was much less than the £2,500 gn the Duke of Bridgewater, one of the syndicate handling the sales, paid for each of Diana and Actaeon and  Diana and Callisto, other poesie.  The 1815 sale was the last time the painting came to the market. It was bought by the Earl of Yarmouth, from 1822 Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford, father of the 4th Marquess, the main collector forming the Wallace Collection. The 3rd Marquess contributed relatively few pictures to the Wallace Collection, and those were mostly portraits.The painting was initially not regarded as one of the stars of the collection.  Between 1842 and about 1854 it was stored in the Pantechnicon repository in London, before moving to Hertford House, now home of the Wallace Collection, where it has remained. An 1870 inventory records it in the ""Lumber Room"" there, described as by Domenichino, and Ingamells notes disapprovingly that ""between 1876 and 1897 [it] hung unglazed over a bath in Sir Richard Wallace's dressing room"", before being correctly identified and rescued from the steam.    The painting was not copied by Titian or his workshop, as the first two poesie were, but later copies exist. When Philip II gave the painting away, a copy was made for the Spanish royal collection, which in 1882 was sent to the museum in Gerona, Spain. The Hermitage Museum has a copy that probably once belonged to Prince Eugene of Savoy.  The Musée Ingres in Montauban, France has a 17th-century copy once in the Palace of Versailles, where it was recorded in 1683.An engraving by the Venetian Ferrando Bertelli probably dates to the 1550s and is a close rendering, though extending the composition on all sides except the left, possibly reflecting the original size of the painting, which has been cut down to an unknown extent. Giovanni Battista Fontana (1524–1587) produced two prints, one dated 1564 and not very similar, the other closer to the Titian and undated.  Neither are exactly reproductions.  Illustrations to Ovid from the late 16th century on often adopt aspects, or the general layout of the painting, without being copies.  The many paintings of the subject in later centuries tended to follow Titian's reduction of the subject to the two main figures and the monster, although not copying his composition. The subject became especially popular in the 19th century.    Danaë, delivered to Philip in 1553, now Wellington Collection, with earlier and later versions.

"The Pietà now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice is one of the last paintings by the Italian master Titian, and in its final, extended state was left incomplete at his death in 1576, to be completed by Palma Giovane. [SEP]  Titian had intended it to hang over his grave, and the two stages of painting were to make it fit in two different churches. The picture is among Titian's last, one of several left unfinished at his death.  An inscription in the lower part of the picture records that it was finished by Palma Giovane, whose interventions seem to have been kept to the minimum necessary, and doing his best to match Titian's own style.  A minimalist view of the areas he worked on is that it ""was limited to the angel with the torch and to touching up the tympanum of the stone shrine"", but the female statue and Jerome's cloak have also been suspected of showing his hand, and he may have touched up the architecture more generally.The painting is one of a group in Titian's distinctive late style, which begins fully about 1570, though continuing trends seen in earlier works as far back as the mid-1550s.  He often kept paintings in the studio for a long period, with several probably unfinished at his death in 1576. His brushwork becomes bold, but imprecise and impressionistic, and worked over many times, as recorded in a famous description by Palma Giovane.  The distinction between forms and the space between them almost disappears, and ""The forms emerge like wraiths out of the circumambient darkness, and mass is reduced to a flickering pattern of colour and light.  In his last years only these elements had reality for Titian.""There is a long-running argument about which of the works of the 1570s have been completed, and by whom. In this case, the main group of the Pietà, in its first form, is known to have been delivered by Titian as finished, and the full expanded composition to have been finished by Palma Giovane.  Other important paintings of the 1570s are Tarquin and Lucretia, which was delivered in 1571, the Saint Jerome delivered in 1575, and the Flaying of Marsyas, The Death of Actaeon, the Hermitage Museum's Saint Sebastian and the Crowning with Thorns in Munich, all of which were probably in his studio at his death.     An original, much smaller, composition just showing the basic two figures of the standard Pietà subject in Christian art, which consists of Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Christ, was expanded after being completed and delivered (see below).Behind the central figures there is now a large rusticated Mannerist aedicule or niche, flanked by statues standing on plinths carved with giant lion heads.  Along the top of the broken pediment six flaming lamps give a dull light, with another half-hidden in the centre, with vegetation around them, perhaps ""the figleaves of the Fall of Man"".  A patch of dark sky can be seen at top left.  Three massive keystone-like blocks in the centre drop below even the bottom of the pediment, a feature typical of the Mannerist architecture of Giulio Romano and his followers.  These three blocks have been said to represent the Holy Trinity, or ""Christ as foundation of the faith"".A figure who is either the Nicodemus of the gospels or, as usually thought today, Saint Jerome, approaches Christ on his knees, and reaches out to touch his hand. This is generally agreed to be a self-portrait of Titian. On the left, standing and completing a right-angled triangle of the human figures, is Mary Magdalene, who unlike the other figures seems to be in motion. Whether she has just arrived on the scene, or is rushing away in horror is unclear.The two statues at the sides of the grand niche in the background are Moses on the left and the Hellespontine Sibyl on the right, both identified by inscriptions on their pedestals.  The Sibyl was thought to have prophesied the coming of Christ and his crucifixion.  A putto-angel with a flaming torch illuminates the scene, which is dark and evidently set at night. In particular his torch reveals the gold mosaic in the semi-dome of the niche, where in the centre a pelican feeds its young by pecking its own breast to draw blood, a phenomenon believed since classical times in traditional zoology, which had become a common visual symbol of the Passion of Christ and its redemptive effects for man.In the bottom right corner a small ex voto picture is propped up against the base of the right-hand statue.  It shows two men kneeling in prayer to a Pietà in the air.  These are agreed to represent Titian and his son Orazio, probably praying to be spared from the plague that in fact killed them both, a full year after it arrived in Venice. Behind the picture, and partly concealed by it, is a small shield with Titian's coat of arms.  In the bottom left corner another young angel is picking up an urn, perhaps the Magdalene's attribute of a jar of ointment.    Titian had always intended to be buried in the church in Pieve di Cadore where he was baptized.  He frequently visited the village, on the edge of Venetian territory in the mountains some 110 km almost due north of the city, although he had left it for Venice over 75 years before his death in 1576.  But around 1572 a series of rows with the local authorities there and his relations led him to change his mind, and plan a burial in the large Franciscan church of the Frari in Venice, which contained two of his important early masterpieces, the Assunta on the main altar and the Pesaro Altarpiece on a side wall, nearly opposite the intended site.He chose a spot in a chapel with a famous crucifix in it and made the Pietà for it, presenting it to the church. He thought he had an agreement with the friars, but it emerged that they would not move the crucifix, and hung the painting in another chapel.  Titian was furious, and eventually got the papal nuncio in Venice to instruct the friars to return the painting to him, in a decree of 1 March 1575.  Titian now planned once again to be buried in the church in Pieve di Cadore, with the painting over the high altar, and once the painting was back in his studio he extended it to fit the space there.In 1576 Titian died in the middle of a major epidemic of plague, followed a few days later by his son Orazio, and it was impossible to arrange for the transportation of the body to Cadore. He was at least not buried in one of the mass-graves used for most of the dead, but quietly carried to the Frari and buried there.  The painting would probably have been taken to Cadore if Orazio had survived the plague, but with his death the ownership of Titian's estate was disputed between various heirs, and it remained in Venice.The painting was finished by Palma Giovane; it seems he only received it some years after Titian's death, and then had it in his studio for some years.  He added an inscription recording his contribution below Christ.  Only after Palma's death in 1628 did it finally hang in a church, but this was St Angelo in Venice, which was closed in 1810, and demolished in 1837.  It entered the Gallerie dell'Accademia in 1814.  The painting has achieved a presence in the Frari as it is one of the five religious paintings by Titian represented in marble reliefs on the large monument to him put up in the church in the 19th century, in the chapel where the painting was intended to hang.    In the Frari the painting was intended to hang in the Cappella di Crocefisso (""Chapel of the Crucifix""), where Titian was buried, and where his monument now stands. Like his much earlier masterpiece, the Pesaro Altarpiece, which was diagonally across the church, the painting was designed to be viewed in passing by people moving through the huge church, as well as those stopping in front of it.  Those entering at the back and moving forward would pass the painting on the second altar on their right, seeing the triangle of figures rising to a termination in Mary Magdalene.  Indeed, she looks and gestures roughly in the direction of the Pesaro Altarpiece, further up the church on the other side, while the statues, both looking to the left at a sharper angle, have been seen as indicating the way to the Assunta on the high altar.The expansion of the painting to fit the space in Cadore (see below) affected each edge of the painting. To the original two strips of canvas, sewn together, five more were added: one across the whole top, two at the sides, a thinner strip at the bottom, and a small piece at the botton right corner.    For Tom Nichols, ""Titian's dramatization of the conflicting emotions of those who witness Christ's death lends his painting its bleakly expressive power.  His focus effectively breaks up the usual formal unity expected of a pietà, isolating its protagonists from each other to undermine more abstract possibilities of aesthetic harmony or more resolved theological meaning.""The Pietà was an unusual subject in Venice, and Titian's choice of it probably relates to Michelangelo's Florentine Pietà, also originally intended to decorate the artist's tomb, with a self-portrait as Nicodemus.  Throughout Titian's career he had reflected the paragone, or argument over superiority in art, with works asserting the superiority of painting over sculpture, within painting of Venice over Florence, and ""it is not difficult to read the radically pictorial quality of his Virgin and Child as a last attempt to defeat his great rival."" Erwin Panofsky prefers to see it as ""A lifelong rivalry, compounded of mutual respect as well as opposition, ended in a tribute paid by the survivor to his defunct antagonist — and doing honor to both"".There are also elements looking back to Titian's master Giovanni Bellini, for example the mosaic semi-dome, seen in Bellini's San Giobbe Altarpiece of c. 1487, now also in the Accademia.According to Sidney J. Freedburg, it ""is less a painting about Christian death and tragedy than a splendid and impassioned affirmation of both art and life. Its true protagonist is the Magdalene, salient in a radiance of green against a gold-shot background, who walks out of the picture into the real world, shouting, palpable, magnificent, and one with us in life. She illustrates a cry of grief, but makes the effect of pronouncement of victory.   "
"Pope Sixtus IV (21 July 1414 – 12 August 1484), born Francesco della Rovere, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 9 August 1471 to his death. [SEP] His accomplishments as pope included the construction of the Sistine Chapel and the creation of the Vatican Archives. A patron of the arts, he brought together the group of artists who ushered the  Early Renaissance into Rome with the first masterpieces of the city's new artistic age. Sixtus founded the Spanish Inquisition through the bull Exigit sincerae devotionis affectus (1478), and he annulled the decrees of the Council of Constance. He was noted for his nepotism and was personally involved in the infamous Pazzi conspiracy.    Francesco was born to a family of modest means from Liguria, Italy, the son of Leonardo della Rovere and Luchina Monleoni. He was born in Celle Ligure, a town near Savona.As a young man, Della Rovere joined the Franciscan Order, an unlikely choice for a political career, and his intellectual qualities were revealed while he was studying philosophy and theology at the University of Pavia. He went on to lecture at Padua and many other Italian universities.In 1464, Della Rovere was elected Minister General of the Franciscan order at the age of 50. In 1467, he was appointed Cardinal by Pope Paul II with the titular church being the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli. Before his papal election, Cardinal della Rovere was renowned for his unworldliness and had written learned treatises, including On the Blood of Christ and On the Power of God. His reputation for piety was one of the deciding factors that prompted the College of Cardinals to elect him Pope upon the unexpected death of Paul II at the age of fifty-four.     Upon being elected Pope, Della Rovere adopted the name Sixtus, which had not been used since the 5th century. One of his first acts was to declare a renewed crusade against the Ottoman Turks in Smyrna. However, after the conquest of Smyrna, the fleet disbanded.  Some fruitless attempts were made towards unification with the Greek Church. For the remainder of his pontificate, Sixtus turned to temporal issues and dynastic considerations.     Sixtus IV sought to strengthen his position by surrounding himself with relatives and friends. In the fresco by Melozzo da Forlì, he is accompanied by his Della Rovere and Riario nephews, not all of whom were made cardinals; the protonotary apostolic Pietro Riario (on his right), the future Pope Julius II/ Giuliano Della Rovere standing before him; and Girolamo Riario and Giovanni della Rovere, behind the kneeling Platina, author of the first humanist history of the popes. His nephew Pietro Riario also benefited from his nepotism. Pietro became one of the richest men in Rome and was entrusted with Pope Sixtus' foreign policy. However, Pietro died prematurely in 1474, and his role passed to Giuliano Della Rovere. The secular fortunes of the Della Rovere family began when Sixtus invested his nephew Giovanni with the lordship of Senigallia and arranged his marriage to the daughter of Federico III da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino; from that union came a line of Della Rovere dukes of Urbino that lasted until the line expired, in 1631. Six of the thirty-four cardinals that he created were his nephews.In his territorial aggrandizement of the Papal States, his niece's son Cardinal Raffaele Riario, for whom the Palazzo della Cancelleria was constructed, was suspected of  colluding in the failed Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 to assassinate both Lorenzo de' Medici and his brother Giuliano and replace them in Florence with Sixtus IV's other nephew, Girolamo Riario. Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa and a main organizer of the plot, was hanged on the walls of the Florentine Palazzo della Signoria. Sixtus IV replied with an interdict and two years of war with Florence. According to the later published chronicle of the Italian historian Stefano Infessura, Diary of the City of Rome, Sixtus was a ""lover of boys and sodomites"", awarding benefices and bishoprics in return for sexual favours and nominating a number of young men as cardinals, some of whom were celebrated for their good looks. However, Infessura had partisan allegiances to the Colonna and so is not considered to be always reliable or impartial. The English churchman and Protestant polemicist John Bale, writing a century later, attributed to Sixtus ""the authorisation to practice sodomy during periods of warm weather"" to the ""Cardinal of Santa Lucia"". Although such accusations are easily dismissed as anti-Catholic propaganda, they still prompted the noted historian of the Catholic Church, Ludwig von Pastor, to issue a firm rebuttal.    Sixtus continued a dispute with King Louis XI of France, who upheld the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438), which held that papal decrees needed royal assent before they could be promulgated in France. That was a cornerstone of the privileges claimed for the Gallican Church and could never be shifted as long as Louis XI manoeuvred to replace King Ferdinand I of Naples with a French prince. Louis was thus in conflict with the papacy, and Sixtus could not permit it. On 1 November 1478, Sixtus published the papal bull Exigit Sincerae Devotionis Affectus through which the Spanish Inquisition was established in the Kingdom of Castile. Sixtus consented under political pressure from Ferdinand of Aragon, who threatened to withhold military support from his kingdom of Sicily. Nevertheless, Sixtus IV quarrelled over protocol and prerogatives of jurisdiction; he was unhappy with the excesses of the Inquisition and condemned the most flagrant abuses in 1482.As a temporal prince who constructed stout fortresses in the Papal States, he encouraged the Venetians to attack Ferrara, which he wished to obtain for another nephew. Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, was allied with the Sforzas of Milan, the Medicis of Florence along with the King of Naples, normally a hereditary ally and champion of the papacy. The angered Italian princes allied to force Sixtus IV to make peace to his great annoyance. For refusing to desist from the very hostilities that he himself had instigated and for being a dangerous rival to Della Rovere dynastic ambitions in the Marche, Sixtus placed Venice under interdict in 1483. He also lined the coffers of the state by unscrupulously selling high offices and privileges.In ecclesiastical affairs, Sixtus promoted the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, which had been confirmed at the Council of Basle in 1439, and he designated 8 December as its feastday. In 1476, he issued the apostolic constitution Cum Praeexcelsa, establishing a Mass and Office for the feast. He formally annulled the decrees of the Council of Constance in 1478.    The two papal bulls issued by Pope Nicholas V, Dum Diversas of 1452 and Romanus Pontifex of 1455, had effectively given the Portuguese the rights to acquire slaves along the African Coast by force or trade. Those concessions were confirmed by Sixtus in his own bull, Aeterni regis, of 21 June 1481. Arguably the ""ideology of conquest"" expounded in those texts became the means by which commerce and conversion were facilitated.In November 1476, Isabel and Fernando ordered an investigation into rights of conquest in the Canary Islands, and in the spring of 1478, they sent Juan Rejon with sixty soldiers and thirty cavalry to the Grand Canary, where the natives retreated inland. Sixtus's earlier threats to excommunicate all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians in the bull Regimini Gregis of 1476 could have been intended to emphasise the need to convert the natives of the Canary Islands and Guinea and establish a clear difference in status between those who had converted and those who resisted. The ecclesiastical penalties were directed towards those who were enslaving the recent converts.     As a civic patron in Rome, even the anti-papal chronicler Stefano Infessura agreed that Sixtus should be admired. The dedicatory inscription in the fresco by Melozzo da Forlì in the Vatican Palace records: ""You gave your city temples, streets, squares, fortifications, bridges and restored the Acqua Vergine as far as the Trevi..."" In addition to restoring the aqueduct that provided Rome an alternative to the river water, which had made the city famously unhealthy, he restored or rebuilt over 30 of Rome's dilapidated churches such as San Vitale (1475) and Santa Maria del Popolo, and he added seven new ones. The Sistine Chapel was sponsored by Sixtus IV, as was the Ponte Sisto, the Sistine Bridge (the first new bridge across the Tiber since Antiquity) and the building of Via Sistina (later named Borgo Sant'Angelo), a road leading from Castel Sant'Angelo to Saint Peter. All of that was done to facilitate the integration of the Vatican Hill and Borgo with the heart of Old Rome. That was part of a broader scheme of urbanization carried out under Sixtus IV, who swept the long-established markets from the Campidoglio in 1477 and decreed in a bull of 1480 the widening of streets and the first post-Roman paving, the removal of porticoes and other post-classical impediments to free public passage.  At the beginning of his papacy, in 1471, Sixtus had donated several historically important Roman sculptures that founded a papal collection of art, which would eventually develop into the collections of the Capitoline Museums. He also refounded, enriched and enlarged the Vatican Library. He had Regiomontanus attempt the first sanctioned reorganisation of the Julian calendar and increased the size and prestige of the papal chapel choir, bringing singers and some prominent composers (Gaspar van Weerbeke, Marbrianus de Orto and Bertrandus Vaqueras) to Rome from the north. In addition to being a patron of the arts, Sixtus was a patron of the sciences. Before he became pope, he had spent time at the very liberal and cosmopolitan University of Padua, which maintained considerable independence from the Church and had a very international character. As Pope, he issued a papal bull allowing local bishops to give the bodies of executed criminals and unidentified corpses to physicians and artists for dissection. It was that access to corpses which allowed the anatomist Vesalius, along with Titian's pupil Jan Stephen van Calcar, to complete the revolutionary medical/anatomical text De humani corporis fabrica.        The Pope created 34 cardinals in eight consistories held during his reign, among them three nephews, one grandnephew and one other relative, thus continuing the practice of nepotism that he and his successors would engage in during this period.    Sixtus IV named seven new saints with the most notable being Bonaventure (1482); he also beatified one person: John Buoni (1483).    In 1477, Sixtus IV issued a  papal bull, authorizing the creation of Uppsala University - the first university in Sweden and in the whole of Scandinavia. The choice of this location for the university derived from the fact that the archbishopric of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century, as well as Uppsala being long-standing hub for regional trade.  Uppsala's bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, established a number of provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university's Chancellor, and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members. This act of Sixtus IV had a profound long-term effect on the society and culture of Sweden, an effect which continues up to the present.     Sixtus IV became ill on 8 August 1484; this illness worsened on 10 August while the pope was attending an event in Rome. He felt unwell that evening and was forced to cancel a meeting he was to hold with his cardinals the following morning. The Pope grew weaker during the night of 11 August and he was unable to sleep. Pope Sixtus IV died the following evening - 12 August. The envoy of the Medici family summed up Sixtus' reign in the announcement to his master 'Today at 5 o'clock His Holiness Sixtus IV departed this life-may God forgive him!' Pope Sixtus's tomb was destroyed in the Sack of Rome in 1527. Today, his remains, along with the remains of his nephew Pope Julius II (Giuliano della Rovere), are interred in St. Peter's Basilica, in the floor in front of the monument to Pope Clement X. A marble tombstone marks the site. His bronze funerary monument, now in the basement Treasury of St. Peter's Basilica, made like a giant casket of goldsmith's work, is by Antonio Pollaiuolo. The top of the casket is a lifelike depiction of the Pope lying in state. Around the sides are bas-relief panels depicting allegorical female figures representing Grammar, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Painting, Astronomy, Philosophy and Theology—the classical liberal arts, with the addition of painting and theology. Each figure incorporates the oak tree (""rovere"" in Italian), symbol of Sixtus IV. The overall program of the panels, their beauty, complex symbolism, classical references and their relative arrangement are compelling and comprehensive illustrations of the Renaissance worldview. None of them actually states how he died.     Sixtus created an unusually large number of cardinals during his pontificate (23) who were drawn from the roster of the princely houses of Italy, France and Spain, thus ensuring that many of his policies continued after his death:    Pope Sixtus is portrayed by Arthur Grosser in the short film Assassin's Creed: Lineage, a prequel to the video game Assassin's Creed II. Pope Sixtus is portrayed by James Faulkner in the historical fantasy Da Vinci's Demons as having an identical twin, Alessandro. Shortly after the true Pope Sixtus, Francesco, was elected on conclave, Alessandro usurped the Holy See and had his brother locked up in Castel Sant'Angelo. The series implies that many of the more unsavoury parts of Sixtus' reign were really the work of his evil twin, who was out to gain power for himself. Pope Sixtus is portrayed by Raul Bova in the second season, and John Lynch in the third season of the TV series Medici: Masters of Florence.     List of Popes   "
"The Rape of Europa is a painting by the Italian artist Titian, painted ca. [SEP] 1560–1562. It hangs in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts. The oil-on-canvas painting measures 178 by 205 centimetres (70 in × 81 in).    The title of the painting refers to the mythological story of the abduction of Europa by Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans). In the myth, the god assumed the form of a bull and enticed Europa to climb onto his back. Once there, the bull rode into the sea and carried her to Crete, where he revealed his real identity. Europa became the first Queen of Crete, and had three children with Zeus.  Although the source of Titian’s inspiration is thought to have been based on the scene from Book II in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, a more direct influence might be a description of a painting of the rape of Europa found in Achilles Tatius’s novel, Leucippe and Clitophon. Achilles Tatius’s novel was translated into Italian and printed in 1546 in Venice, only a few years before Titian was thought to have painted The Rape of Europa. Achilles Tatius’s description of the dolphins, Europa’s scarf, a Cupid, Europa’s covering, and ""her position on the back of the bull—not with a leg on each side but with her feet on the bull’s right side and her left hand on his horn"" is echoed in Titian’s portrayal of the same scene.    Titian is unequivocal about the fact that this is a scene of rape (abduction): Europa is sprawled helplessly on her back, her clothes in disarray. The painting depicts Europa on the back of the bull, just off the shore of her homeland. Although the act of sexual violence is not depicted in the painting, it is implied through Europa's open-legged posture and her expression of fear as she is dragged off by Zeus. Her danger is also implied by her waving a red silk scarf and by the sea monster in the foreground of the painting. In other parts of the painting, two putti in the sky chase after Europa, and one rides on a dolphin in the sea.Yael Even has theorized that Titian could have created this painting not due to any particular attachment to the subject, but in order to assert his abilities as a painter. Even further states that this artwork’s primary purpose was to show everyone that Titian had eclipsed his master, Bellini, and also to establish that painting was superior to sculpture.    The painting was one of the ""poesie"" painted by Titian for Philip II of Spain. With Diana and Callisto and Diana and Actaeon, both now shared by London and Edinburgh, it was one of three Titian poesies given by Philip V of Spain to the French ambassador, the Duke of Gramont, who in turn presented them to Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France from 1715–1723. For most of the 18th century it was in the Orleans Collection in Paris. It was purchased by Bernard Berenson on behalf of art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner in 1896.

"The Sleeping Venus (Italian: Venere dormiente), also known as the Dresden Venus (Venere di Dresda), is a painting traditionally attributed to the Italian Renaissance painter Giorgione, although it has long been usually thought that Titian completed it after Giorgione's death in 1510. [SEP]  The landscape and sky are generally accepted to be mainly by him.  In the 21st century, much scholarly opinion has shifted further, to see the nude figure of Venus as also painted by Titian, leaving Giorgione's contribution uncertain.  It is in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden. After World War II, the painting was briefly in possession of the Soviet Union. The painting, one of the last works by Giorgione (if it is), portrays a nude woman whose profile seems to echo the rolling contours of the hills in the background.  It is the first known reclining nude in Western painting, and together with the Pastoral Concert (Louvre), another painting disputed between Titian and Giorgione, it established ""the genre of erotic mythological pastoral"", with female nudes in a landscape, accompanied in that case by clothed males.  A single nude woman in any position was an unusual subject for a large painting at this date, although it was to become popular for centuries afterwards, as ""the reclining female nude became a distinctive feature of Venetian painting"".There was originally a sitting figure of Cupid beside Venus's feet, which was over-painted in the 19th century.  In the course of painting, the landscape has also been changed at both sides, as has the colouring of the drapery, and the head of Venus was originally seen in profile, making it very similar to Titian's later Pardo Venus.     According to the usual account, the painting was unfinished at the time of Giorgione's death. The landscape and sky were later finished by Titian, who in 1534 painted the similar Venus of Urbino, and several other reclining female nudes, such as his much repeated Venus and Musician and Danaë compositions, both from the 1540s onwards.  Other elements reused by Titian are the mountains on the horizon at left, which reappear in The Gypsy Madonna (c. 1511, Vienna) and the buildings on the right, seen again in the Noli me tangere of c. 1514 (National Gallery).The painting is usually identified with one, including a Cupid, described in the collection of Girolamo Marcello in 1525 by Marcantonio Michiel, a Venetian patrician interested in art, who left notes compiled between about 1521 and 1543 on paintings he saw.  He describes the painting as by Giorgione, but with the landscape completed by Titian, and until very recently this double attribution has been generally accepted, despite art historians knowing that ""Giorgiones"" were already rare and over-attributed even by this early date.  At least by the time Carlo Ridolfi saw the Marcello painting, about a century later, Cupid was holding a bird, whereas in the Dresden painting (viewed in x-rays) he seems to be pointing his bow, perhaps at the viewer, although his pose is hard to decipher.  It remains possible that the Marcello painting is not in fact the one now in Dresden, or that it is, but that the information Michiel was presumably given as to its authorship is incorrect.Marcello married in 1507, and it has been suggested that he commissioned the painting to celebrate this; the suitability of a reclining nude as a marriage picture has also been explored in connection with the Venus of Urbino.The painting was bought from a French dealer for Augustus the Strong of Saxony in 1695 as a Giorgione, but by 1722 was described in a catalogue as the ""Famous Venus lying in a landscape by Titian"".  By the early 19th century it was thought to be a copy after Titian.  It was not identified with the painting Michiel saw before the 19th century, when Giovanni Morelli proposed this, following which Michiel's attribution to Giorgione, with a Titian landscape, was mostly accepted for over a century.  Any underdrawing was lost when the painting was transferred to a new canvas, probably in the early 19th century.    Underlying erotic implications are made by Venus's raised arm and the placement of her left hand on her groin. The sheets are painted in silver, being a cold colour rather than the more commonly used warm tones for linens, and they are rigid looking in comparison to those depicted in similar paintings by Titian or Velázquez. The landscape mimics the curves of the woman's body and this, in turn, relates the human body back to being a natural, organic object. Sydney Freedberg writes:  The shape of being is the visual demonstration of a state of being in which idealized existence is suspended in immutable slow-breathing harmony. All the sensuality has been distilled off from this sensuous presence, and all incitement; Venus denotes not the act of love but the recollection of it. The perfect embodiment of Giorgione's dream, she dreams his dream herself. The art historian Michael Paraskos has suggested that the painting may be an allegory of the island of Cyprus, which was ceded to Venice by Queen Caterina Cornaro in 1489. Paraskos suggests that the painting was created under influence of the exiled court of the Kingdom of Cyprus, which the Venetian Senate permitted to be established-in-exile at Asolo in the Veneto, and that it evokes a sense of loss and longing to return. As well as suggesting the body of Venus is posed to resemble the shape of the island, Paraskos claims that the geographical features surrounding her resemble those that could be seen by travelling from the Lusignan summer palace at Potamia in the south east of Cyprus, towards the Troodhos mountains in the west.    The pose of the figure has been connected with a figure in one of the woodcut illustrations to Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of 1499, but a nude of this size, as a single subject, was unprecedented in Western painting, and to a large extent determined the treatment of the type for centuries to come, excluding, for example, the more explicit treatment in the contemporary engravings of Giovanni Battista Palumba.  Although prints had contained many more nude female figures, the two famous paintings of Botticelli, the Birth of Venus and the Primavera, are the closest precedents in painting.  The contemplative attitude toward nature and beauty of the figure is typical of Giorgione.  The composition of this painting was highly influential, despite very public display of such images often being restricted for some centuries.  The influence of this painting or paintings it influenced can be traced in a number of later reclining nudes such as the Pardo Venus and Venus of Urbino of Titian, the Rokeby Venus of Velázquez, Goya's teasing La maja desnuda, and Olympia by Manet, and other works by Ingres and Rubens, to name but a few.

"St. [SEP] Mark Enthroned is an early painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian, executed in 1510 or 1511, which is still in the church of Santa Maria della Salute (""Saint Mary of Health"") in Venice.  St. Mark, the patron saint of the Republic of Venice, is portrayed on a high throne, surrounded by St. Roch and St. Sebastian.  Like other Titian paintings from these years, it shows the influence of Giorgione, who died young in 1510.   "
"The Three Ages of Man is a painting by Titian, dated between 1512 and 1514, and now displayed at the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh. [SEP] The 90 cm high by 151 cm wide Renaissance art work was most likely influenced by Giorgione’s themes and motifs of landscapes and nude figures—Titian was known to have completed some of Giorgione’s unfinished works after Giorgione died at age 33 of the plague in 1510. The painting represents the artist’s conception of the life cycle. Childhood and manhood are synonymous with earthly love and death approaching old age are drawn realistically. Titian’s widely chosen topic in art history, ages of man, mixed with his own allegorical interpretation make The Three Ages of Man one of Titian’s most famous works.    It was traditionally identified with a painting that Vasari states Titian painted after returning from Ferrara for his stepfather Giovanni di Castel Bolognese at Faenza, dated to 1515. Critics have also dated it slightly earlier, due to the three sleeping putti to the right, evidently modelled on the Tondo of the innocents by Romanino (Musei civici di Padova), which dates to 1513. Several copies of it are known, one of the best of which is that at Rome's Doria Pamphilj Gallery. After being painted the masterpiece fell into the hands of Matthaus Hopfer. He was known to have a house in the Grottenau filled with ‘poetic fable’ frescoes.  After his death in 1611 it was passed down to the Ebert family, before being put into the Augsburg market. In 1662 Queen Christina of Sweden passed through the city on her way from the Netherlands to Rome. It was listed in her collection at Palazzo Riario in Rome in 1662. There are no verified records of the next exchange between Giovanni da Castel Bolognese and Otto Truchsess von Waldburg but it is a known fact that, at some point, the painting was in the care of both of their hands. Giovanni, a famous gem-engraver and medallist, was recorded as the next owner. Otto was a leading figure at the Habsburg court and a prominent art patron. Before the painting made its way to the museum it was recorded to have made its final presentation in Giovanni’s home in Faenza. Prince Odescalchi gave it to the duke of Orléans in 1722 and it remained in the Orleans Collection until 1798. It was purchased with much of that collection by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, whose descendants later deposited his whole collection with the National Gallery of Scotland for storage and display.    The Scottish National Gallery describes the painting as a poetic meditation on the transience of human life and love set in a poetic landscape. At the right Cupid playfully clambers over two sleeping infants. At the left we see young lovers about to embrace. In the middle distance an old man, looking very much like the penitent St. Jerome, is contemplating a pair of skulls - by implication of former lovers. The church in the background may serve to remind viewers of the Christian promise of salvation and eternal life.   "
"Vanity is an oil painting by the Italian late Renaissance painter Titian, dated to around 1515 and now held at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany. [SEP]    The work was perhaps in Emperor Rudolf II's gallery in Prague, before becoming part of that of the Electors of Bavaria. It has part of the Munich museum's collection since 1884. The first mention dates to 1748, as a work by Francesco Salviati. It was later attributed to Palma the Elder, Giorgione, il Pordenone and finally Titian. Radio analysis has proved the presence of workshop additions (in particular to the mirror) above an original, probably by Titian, based on the Woman at the Mirror.    The painting portrays an idealized beautiful woman, a model established in the Venetian school by Titian's master Giorgione with his Laura. She holds an oval mirror with a frame, which reflects some jewels and a maid who is searching in a case. The woman was portrayed by Titian in numerous other works of the period, including the Woman at the Mirror, Salome and Flora, as well as some Holy Conversations.   "
"Venus Blindfolding Cupid is a c.1565 painting by Titian, now in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. [SEP] The painting has been copied many times.  		 This painting was formerly in the collection of Cornelis van der Geest and can be seen in two paintings of his art gallery in the 1630s by Willem van Haecht."
"The Venus of Urbino (also known as Reclining Venus) is an oil painting by the Italian painter Titian, which seems to have been begun in 1532 or 1534, and was perhaps completed in 1534, but not sold until 1538. [SEP] It depicts a nude young woman, traditionally identified with the goddess Venus, reclining on a couch or bed in the sumptuous surroundings of a Renaissance palace. It is now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The figure's pose is based on the Dresden Venus, traditionally attributed to Giorgione but which Titian at least completed the landscape. In this depiction, Titian has domesticated Venus by moving her to an indoor setting, engaging her with the viewer, and making her sensuality explicit; some even believe the figure is engaging in masturbation.Interpretations of the painting fall into two groups; both agree that the painting has a powerful erotic charge, but beyond that it is seen either as a portrait of a courtesan, perhaps Zaffetta, or as a painting celebrating the marriage of its first owner (who according to some may not have commissioned it). This disagreement forms part of a wider debate on the meaning of the mainly Venetian tradition of the reclining female nude, which Titian had created, or helped to create, some 25 years before with the Dresden Venus of around 1510–11. For Charles Hope, ""It has yet to be shown that the most famous example of this genre, Titian's Venus of Urbino, is anything other than a representation of a beautiful nude woman on a bed, devoid of classical or even allegorical content."" Even the indefatigable finder of allegories drawing on Renaissance Neoplatonism, Edgar Wind, had to admit that in this case ""an undisguised hedonism had at last dispelled the Platonic metaphors"".A recent theory by Józef Grabski suggests that the painting represents an allegory of marital love between famous Italian poet Vittoria Colonna and her deceased husband, Fernando d'Ávalos. Grabski supports his theory through analyzing various visual clues and symbols, the most prominent being the classic column in front of the trees in the window in the right half, a small detail on the painting that imitates the Colonna Family coat of arms.    The Venus stares straight at the viewer, unconcerned with her nudity. In her right hand she holds a posy of roses whilst she holds her other hand over her genitals. In the near background is a dog, often a symbol of fidelity.  In a different space in the background two maids are shown rummaging through a cassone chest, where clothes were kept.  The detailed depiction of the interior setting is unusual, perhaps unique, in Titian.  Titian contracted for the 21 year old Ippolito de' Medici, reluctantly made a cardinal (though not a priest), by his uncle, Pope Clement VII. He was trying to pursue a military career, and was a papal diplomat. On 20 October 1532 he spent the night in Venice with Angela del Moro, or Angela Zaffetta, a leading courtesan in Venice and sometimes a dining companion of Titian and Aretino, the latter a friend of the cardinal.  Titian painted Ippolito's portrait, and it seems likely that he was asked to add a nude portrait of Angela Zaffetta, or that Titian decided to paint one in the hope he would like it. On 20 December 1534 Titian wrote to Ippolito's chamberlain in Rome saying that he had been working on a painting of a woman for the cardinal.  Ippolito died in August 1535, and apparently never saw the painting, which was still in Titian's studio when Guidobaldo II della Rovere, the 24-year-old son of the Duke of Urbino came in January 1538 to sit for a portrait.  As letters from him and his mother show, he was extremely keen to buy it, and did so some months later; he refers to it simply as ""the nude woman"", and was worried Titian would sell it to someone else.  Later that year he inherited the Duchy of Urbino on the death of his father, hence the painting acquired the name by which it is usually known, although it seems it was mostly kept in Pesaro from early on. Alternatively, the painting may have been commissioned by Guidobaldo, possibly to celebrate his marriage in 1534 to the 10 year-old Giulia Varano, which made him Duke of Camerino, or its consummation, which was probably a few years later.  Some critics have seen references to marriage in details such as the maids at the cassone, where the corredo or trousseau of clothes generally given to the bride by her husband's family were stored.  Rona Goffen sees Venus's hand ""caressing"" her genitals as such a reference, as it was believed at the time that a female ""emission"" or orgasm was necessary for conception to take place, and female masturbation was therefore allowed only in cases where the male had ejaculated and withdrawn.  The production of heirs was of great concern in elite marriages. Even the little dog on the bed has been brought into the argument; an identical dog is shown in Titian's portrait of the duke's mother Eleonora Gonzaga, the reasoning being that the dog identifies the house as a della Rovere home, and that it remains quiet indicates that the viewer is the husband of the woman.    In 1624, as the Papacy moved to fully annex the duchy to the Papal States, the della Rovere court moved to Pesaro, where the painting hung in the Villa Imperiale.  It joined the Medici family collections in 1633 when the last della Rovere, Vittoria della Rovere, married Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.  It was moved to the Uffizi in 1736, and has remained there ever since, apart from visits to exhibitions which in the 21st century have included Madrid, Brussels, Tokyo, Venice and Urbino.  It has long been famous, as is shown by its prominent placing at the front of the gallery group portrait by Johan Zoffany of the Tribuna of the Uffizi of the 1770s. In his 1880 travelogue A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain called the Venus of Urbino ""the foulest, the vilest, the obscenest picture the world possesses"".  He proposed that ""it was painted for a bagnio [brothel], and it was probably refused because it was a trifle too strong"", adding humorously that ""in truth, it is a trifle too strong for any place but a public art gallery"". Twain does this to juxtapose the artistic license (for nudity, for example) allowed in painting, as opposed to the restrictions and Victorian morality imposed on literature in the ""last eighty or ninety years"". In the same passage, Twain also mocks the fig leaves placed in the 19th century on nude statues in Rome, which had ""stood in innocent nakedness for ages.""  The Venus of Urbino was one of the inspirations for Édouard Manet's 1863 Olympia,  in which the figure of Venus is replaced with the model Victorine Meurent.    Lorenzo Bartolini developed the same theme in sculpture with his Venus (about 1830), based on the painting that his friend J.A.D. Ingres copied for him from the Titian version. The original sculpture is located at the Musée Fabre in Montpellier; a copy is at the Lady Lever Art Gallery near Liverpool. 		   "
"Violante is an oil painting attributed to Titian, dated to around 1515 and now held at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. [SEP]    The work was part of the Venetian collection of Bartolomeo della Nave and in 1636, it was sold to the Duke of Hamilton, who brought it to London. In 1659, it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, whose collection later became part of the current museum. The title refers to the traditional identification with Violante, the daughter of painter Palma the Elder (to whom the painting was assigned for a long time), which has however no proof. An etching by David Teniers the Younger show the painting having larger size, although a representation of the archduke's gallery from the same artist depicts it in the same current size. The painting must have been a popular painting when it was in the Archduke's cabinet, as it was portrayed in his gallery paintings.  		 		 		 		 The work was attributed to Titian by Italian art historian Roberto Longhi. The woman portrayed is very similar to that in the Balbi Holy Conversation and a series of portraits of wavy-haired blonde women such as the Woman at the Mirror, Flora, the Vanity, Salome and the Young Woman with Black Dress.   "
"Woman with a Mirror (French: La Femme au miroir) is a painting by Titian, dated to c. 1515 and now in the Musée du Louvre. [SEP]    It is known to have been in the Gonzaga family's collection in Mantua from which it was bought by Charles I of England. After Charles' execution, it was sold off and purchased by Louis XIV of France for the Palace of Versailles.  Several attempts have been made to identify the main female figure – these have included Titian's lover, Alfonso d'Este's lover Laura Dianti, or Federico Gonzaga's lover Isabella Boschetti. None of these theories fit the date ascribed to the painting through analysis of its style, which is 1512–15, when the courts of Mantua and Ferrara were first becoming interested in Titian. Dianti was painted by Titian in a portrait of 1523. She is probably just a model who appears in other paintings – the same woman with frizzy reddish blonde hair appears in a series of paintings from around the same time (including the Flora at the Uffizi, the Vanity in Munich, the Salome in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, the Violante and the Young woman in a black dress in Vienna) as well as several Madonnas and the clothed figure in Sacred and Profane Love. As happened with the 'Bella' series, it was still customary for the artist's workshop to create similar works with variations from the same studies if not from the same cartoon. Many versions of the work are known, equal in quality to the original but not as large. The best are in the MNAC in Barcelona, in the gallery of Prague Castle and in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.   "
"Alfonso d'Avalos Addressing his Troops (Spanish: Alocución del Marqués del Vasto) is a portrait of Alfonso d'Avalos by Titian, painted in around 1540 and now held at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. [SEP] Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquise del Vasto, was a noble Neapolitan, descended from a family of Castilian origin. He participated in the Battle of Pavia and the conquest of Tunis in 1535. In 1538 he was appointed governor of Milan. Military failures caused a subsequent falling out of favor with the Emperor Charles V.This work is both a portrait of the Marquis del Vasto and a picture of history narrating an incident that occurred in 1537. The Spanish troops stationed in Milan began an attempted mutiny over not receiving their pay, but the conflict was suppressed by the Marquis' eloquent speech to the men that inspired loyalty and guaranteed their pay given patience. He, having to leave for affairs elsewhere, left his son with the troops as a guarantee they would be paid.The marquis contracted Titian to paint the scene, depicting his son as a page holding his helmet for him during the speech. The composition is based on classical models, such as the reliefs of the Arch of Constantine and numerous Numismatic works. Titian features the General in an elevated position, addressing his men, and emphasizing his words, as advised classical oratory manuals, with elevation of the right arm.The work was commissioned in 1539 by the Marquis himself, during a trip to Venice. His first public exhibition was in Milan during 1541, taking advantage of the visit of Emperor Charles. It was subsequently acquired by the Gonzaga family, the Dukes of Mantua, and finally by King Charles I of England. When this King was executed his assets were auctioned, and the painting (like others of the same king) was acquired by Philip IV of Spain. In 1828 Fernando VII ceded it to the collection to the Museo del Prado.   "
"The Bacchanal of the Andrians or The Andrians is an oil painting by Titian. [SEP] It is signed ""TICIANUS F.[aciebat]"" and is dated to 1523–1526.The painting is set on the island of Andros. A sleeping nymph and a urinating boy are seen in the lower right foreground while men and women celebrate with jugs of wine. The absence of Bacchus from the painting is explained by Erwin Panofsky, who suggests that the god must be on the departing ship seen in the center background. Due to the artistic liberties Titian took in painting these figures, it is difficult to identify them.  The musical score in the foreground is the canon Chi boyt et ne reboyt il ne seet que boyre soit (""who drinks and does not drink again does not know what drinking is""), attributed to Ferrarese court musician Adrian Willaert.The painting is now held at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but it was commissioned by Alfonso I d'Este for his Camerini d'alabastro ('chambers of alabaster') in Ferrara. The decorative programme included other major paintings celebrating Bacchus and Venus, the gods of wine and love. Like its predecessor Bacchus and Ariadne, The Bacchanal of the Andrians was inspired by the Imagines of Philostratus. The Bacchanal of the Andrians has been admired by other artists including Rubens who copied it in versions that are housed at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.   "
"The Entombment is a 1559 oil-on-canvas painting by the Venetian painter Titian, commissioned by Philip II of Spain. [SEP] It depicts the burial of Jesus in a stone sarcophagus, which is decorated with depictions of Cain and Abel and the binding of Isaac.  The painting measures 137 cm × 175 cm (54 in × 69 in) and is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Titian made several other paintings depicting the same subject, including a similar version of 1572 given as a gift to Antonio Pérez and now also in the Prado, and an earlier version of c.1520 made for the Duke of Mantua and now in the Louvre. The painting is the second of this subject commissioned from Titian by Philip II of Spain.  A smaller version of 1557 was lost on its journey to Spain.  This second larger version was sent to Spain in 1559 along with Titian's Diana and Callisto and Diana and Actaeon, arrived at El Escorial in 1574, where it was displayed in the Iglesia Vieja (Old Church) beside two other paintings by Titian: his Adoration of the Magi and his 1567 second version of Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence.  Titian copies elements of this painting in his later 1572 version given to Antonio Pérez.    Five figures are shown accompanying the body of Christ, three of whom place Christ into the tomb: holding Christ's body is Nicodemus, the Jewish elder that secretly visited Jesus at night to learn about his teachings., while the Virgin Mary with her distinctive blue robe is holding one of Christ's arms, and at his feet is Joseph of Arimathea. Nicodemus bears the traits of the artist himself. This could have been inspired by Michelangelo's idea in his unfinished Deposition from 1550, depicting himself as Nicodemus, supporting the body of Christ, displayed in the cathedral in Florence.The scene also depicts Mary Magdelene, to the right in a white robe with red hair, and John the Evangelist, standing behind Mary with hands clasped.  The stone sarcophagus resembles examples from Ancient Rome.  The unusual depiction of the Virgin, assisting with the entombment, is not mentioned in the Gospel accounts, and may derive from by Pietro Aretino's 1538 book I quattro libri de la humanità di Christo. The painting exhibits a style under development by Titian at the time, characterized by the use of broad brushwork and brilliant colours. It is now in the permanent collection of the Museo del Prado, Madrid.  		 		 		   "
"Equestrian Portrait of Charles V (also Emperor Charles V on Horseback or Charles V at Mühlberg) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian. [SEP] Created between April and September 1548 while Titian was at the imperial court of Augsburg, it is a tribute to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, following his victory in the April 1547 Battle of Mühlberg against the Protestant armies. The portrait in part gains its impact by its directness and sense of contained power: the horse's strength seems just in check, and Charles' brilliantly shining armour and the painting's deep reds are reminders of battle and heroism.  According to Hugh Trevor-Roper, he ""does not exult in his victory.  He is staid, controlled, pensive, but serene"".  Titian recorded all of the foreground elements—the horse, its caparison, and the rider's armour—from those used in the actual battle. Both the armour and harness survive, and are kept at the Royal Armoury in Madrid. It was in the Spanish royal collection until transferred to the Museo del Prado in 1827. There is a second version in a convent in Toledo.     The portrait was commissioned by Charles' sister, Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary, with Charles specifying how he wished to be presented. The emperor was very aware of the importance of portraiture in determining how he was seen by others, and appreciated not only Titian's mastery as a painter, but also the artist's manner of presenting him as a ruler.A seated portrait of Charles, of which the prime version is now in Munich, was painted during the same visit.  Titian came to know Charles V personally, and had painted other portraits of him by this time. A highly intelligent man, Titian was quick witted, humorous and easy company. He had developed such a strong friendship with Charles by the time of this portrait that the emperor's courtiers were uneasy at the extent that a lowly painter was allowed into his confidence. While in Augsburg, Titian was given an apartment close to Charles' own, and allowed easy access and frequent meetings with the emperor.     The painting contains a mix of styles; passages such as the armor and harness display the realism of Titian's early work, while the trees, landscape and sky are built from the broad stretches of colour and strong brushstrokes associated with his work from the 1540s on. It contains surprisingly few iconographic elements, but they are not absent. Pietro Aretino, a contemporary writer whom Titian painted, suggested that he incorporate conventional references to religion and fame. The lance alludes to Saint George, the exemplar of the ""traditional image of a military knight-saint"". The red around Charles' helmet, his sash and on the horse's trim, represents the Catholic faith in the wars of the 16th century. Titian was so keen to capture such vivid reds that he requested a half pound of red lake be brought from Venice to Augsburg. His instruction reveals that he regarded that pigment ""so burning and so splendid...that in comparison the crimson on velvet and silk will become less beautiful"".Drawing on sources such as Roman military art (the statue of Marcus Aurelius on horseback), Renaissance equestrian imagery such as the engravings of Hans Burgkmair, and possibly Dürer's 1513 engraving Knight, Death and the Devil, Titian departs from the traditional rendering of rider on horse, in which one of the horse's front legs is raised (as seen in the gallery of Roman and Renaissance works below). Instead, the horse rears slightly, or may be striking off into a canter, with only its hind legs touching the ground, while Charles still holds the reins lightly, upright but at ease, implying his advanced horsemanship. The influence of the Dürer engraving is subtle. Dürer's knight rides through dark woods, passing figures representing evil and mortality, including a pig-snouted devil and death riding a pale horse. In contrast Charles emerges from a dark wood into an open, though brooding landscape.  Titian creates a tension between the emperor's age and physical frailty, and his reputation as a forceful and determined, dynamic leader. This is most apparent in the fact that Titian portrays Charles heroically, but places him in a calm dawn setting in which there are no signs of battle. Charles' frailty is underlined by the dark overhead clouds, his weary facial expression and weak jaw (his lower jaw protrudes beyond the line of the upper part), though this is subverted so that it instead conveys his resolve. Charles further suffered from gout, and in reality was carried to the battle in a litter. In the portrait, Titian achieves a feeling of steadiness and control through passages such as the darkly painted wood behind the rider, the evenly clouded sky, and Charles' detached, yet steely, gaze into the distance. The sense of forward motion is suggested by the angle of the spear and charging horse as Charles and mount arrive into the open landscape. The sky also resonates with Charles' victory, but as with the landscape, it also contains dark undertones. The skyscape is considered Titian's best, and has been described as ""flaming and shadowed, with gold light fighting with blue, deathly clouds set against a landscape [which] suggests the immensities of space that Charles dominates and the brooding, inner landscape of the soul.""    Many later equestrian portraits of monarchs and rulers display a debt to Titian's depiction of Charles. More obvious and well known works include Anthony van Dyck's 1620 Portrait of Charles I on Horseback which incorporates many of Titian's ideals. Goya's 1812 Equestrian Portrait of the 1st Duke of Wellington expands further, removing the sense of heroism, and presenting a diminished, isolated figure, undersized compared to his mount, almost overwhelmed by the landscape around him, and charging towards a dark skyscape.

"The Fall of Man is a painting of the Fall of Man or story of Adam and Eve by the Venetian artist Titian, dating to around 1550 and now in the Prado in Madrid. [SEP] It is influenced by Raphael's fresco of the same subject in the  Stanza della Signatura in the Vatican, which also had a seated Adam and standing Eve, as well as Albrecht Dürer's engraving Adam and Eve for smaller details. Owned at one point by Philip II of Spain's secretary, Antonio Pérez, and perhaps first commissioned by his father, in 1585 it entered the Spanish royal collection, where it was copied by Rubens between 1628 and 1629 for his own version of the subject.

"La Gloria is a painting by Titian, commissioned by Charles V in 1550 or 1551 and completed in 1554. [SEP] It was first given this title by José Sigüenza in 1601 - it is also known as The Trinity, The Final Judgement or Paradise.  It shows an image from Augustine of Hippo's The City of God describing the glory gained by the blessed and on the right includes Charles himself, with his wife Isabella of Portugal, his son Philip II of Spain, his daughter Joanna of Austria, his sisters: Mary of Hungary and Eleanor of Austria, all wearing their shrouds. Titian's signature is shown on a scroll held by John the Evangelist. At the top is an image of the Holy Trinity next to the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Baptist. The painting also features King David, Moses and Noah, along with a figure in green identified as Mary Magdalene, the Erythraean Sibyl, Judith, Rachel or the Catholic Church. Charles took it to the Monastery of Yuste on his retirement there. It was then moved to the Escorial Monastery until 1837, when it was mentioned as among the works in the Prado Museum.   "

[SEP] It passed from Charles to the Spanish royal collection, from which it passed to its present owner, the Prado in Madrid.  It is a copy or reinterpretation of a portrait of Charles painted in 1532 by Jakob Seisenegger. That portrait was natural but had not pleased its subject and so during his stay in Bologna in 1533 (when Titian also happened to be there) Charles paid Titian 500 ducats to paint a new version of it. This new version is similar to its predecessor but completely transforms its composition, stylising Charles' body by increasing the size of the fur wrap, decreasing the size of the doublet, raising the position of the eyes and lowering the horizon to make Charles fill the space. He is also shown approaching the viewer and the space around him has been emptied and simplified, with warmer colours than in the original. It later inspired Goya's 1799 Charles IV in his Hunting Clothes.   "
"Portrait of Federico II Gonzaga (c. 1529) is a painting by Titian, who signed it Ticianus f.. Today in the Museo del Prado, Madrid, it portrays Federico II, Duke of Mantua who married in 1529; the portrait may have been commissioned for the occasion. [SEP] The dog, a Maltese, is an allegory of faithfulness.The work is mentioned in a 1666 inventory of the  Royal Alcázar of Madrid, coming from the collection of the Marquess of Leganés. Previous owners included Charles I of England, who purchased many paintings from the Gonzaga collection.    Portrait of Francesco Gonzaga   "
"The Portrait of Isabella of Portugal is an oil-on-canvas portrait of Isabella of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress by Titian dating to 1548. [SEP] It was part of the Spanish royal collection and is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.    The subject is Empress Isabella of Portugal (1503–1539), the beloved second wife of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, mother of Philip II of Spain and daughter of Manuel I of Portugal. Titian painted her after her death, using a mediocre painting for reference. For the rest of his life, Charles took the painting with him on all his travels. The portrait follows a classic scheme already used by Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci, in which the model sits next to a window opening on a landscape. The landscape gives depth to the composition, and its greenish and bluish tones provide a contrast to the interior scene dominated by warm colors. The figure shows some stiffness, possibly related to the concept of majesty as used in imperial iconography. She wears a rich red dress and gold brocade and trimmed with rhinestones. It is decorated also with flashy jewelry: a necklace of pearls with a clasp at the chest with gems hanging from another teardrop pearl, a ring on her right hand, and a jewel-topped headdress. Her rigid hairstyle, very fashionable at the time, is made up with braids. The Empress holds an open book in her left hand, perhaps a missal or prayer book, and looks at a distant point with preoccupied expression.   "
The Punishment of Tythus is a mythological painting by Titian dating to 1549 and now in the Museo del Prado. [SEP] It shows the punishment of the giant Tityos from Greek mythology.   
"Religion saved by Spain is an oil on canvas painting produced between 1572 and 1575 by Titian, an Italian master of the Venetian school, commemorating the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. [SEP] It is one of his later works, and is considered to be an outstanding piece. Other titles are Spain succoring Religion or Religion assisted by Spain.It was sent to Philip II of Spain in 1576, remained in the Spanish Royal Collection subsequently, and had been in the Prado Museum since the 19th century.    Spain rescues Religion is an allegory mixed with political propaganda, portraying Spain as a woman in a dramatic landscape, with a shield in her right hand and a spear with the flag of Victory on it in her left hand. Moreover, both her left and right hand fingers make a symbolic V (""victory"") gesture. The shield bears the coat of arms of Philip II, King of Spain from 1556 to 1598.Behind her is a woman carrying a sword, representing Justice. The Turkish threat is shown by a man, perhaps Poseidon, wearing a turban in a chariot with two horses on the sea.  The person symbolizing the Christian religion is depicted as a woman, to the right, falling on her knees, covered with a blue drapery, threatened not only by the Turks but also by Protestantism, represented by snakes.  At the far left behind Justice is the head of man, perhaps Philip's half-brother Juan of Austria, commander of the Christian fleet at the Battle of Lepanto.    In the Battle of Lepanto the troops of the Holy League defeated the Ottoman navy of Selim II (1524–1574). This Holy League was formed by an alliance of Spain, Venice and the Papal States.  The battle halted the expansion of the Ottoman Empire further in Europe.  The composition echoes a painting commenced by Titian for Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara (1486–1534), and left unfinished on the Duke's death; it was seen in Titian's studio in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari, still unfinished. It depicted a male nude bowing to Minerva and another woman with a laurel branch representing Peace, with Amphitrite in a chariot in the sea.  It was modified and sent to Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II before November 1568, to show a figure representing the Holy Roman Empire defending an allegorical figure representing Religion.  It was engraved by Giulio Fontana c.1568, but the original oil painting is now lost.   "
"Self-Portrait is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Italian painter Titian. [SEP] Dating to about 1560, when Titian would have been over 70 years old, it is the later of his two surviving self-portraits. The painting is a realistic and unflattering depiction of the physical effects of old age, and as such shows none of the self-confidence of his earlier self-portrait (c. 1546–47) now in Berlin. That painting shows Titian in three-quarter view in an alert pose.Titian looks remote, aged and gaunt, staring into the middle distance, seemingly lost in thought. Yet the portrait projects dignity, authority and the mark of a master painter.     Titian is dressed in simple but expensive clothes. In the lower left corner of the canvas he holds a paintbrush. Although the presence of the paintbrush is understated, it is the element that gives legitimacy to his implied status. Titian gave no indication as to his craft or profession in the Berlin portrait or any other earlier works; indeed this is one of the earliest self-portraits in western art in which the artist reveals himself as a painter. Titian's influence was such that the work led to numerous self-portraits by later generations of artists, including Velázquez and Goya, who in, respectively, Las Meninas (1656) and Charles IV of Spain and His Family (1800–1801) depicted themselves in the act of painting.The portrait is composed of deep shades of rich and distinguished black and brown, with small touches of white around his face and hair, and on his neckline and chain. Given the relatively flat pictorial plane, the viewer's attention is drawn to the sitter's sharp facial features: his high forehead, hooked nose, long beard and penetrating, deeply set eyes. Here, Titian's command of paint and shade marks a high point of his late period, and while the physical charisma seen in the Berlin picture has been diminished by age, it is now replaced with a sense of authority.Titian was keenly aware of how others perceived him, and sought to control his reputation by keeping to a minimum public knowledge of his life. Giorgio Vasari noted that by this stage in his life Titian had amassed enough wealth to not depend on commissioned work, or be beholden to any patron. His self-portrait was intended to enhance how he was viewed by others. It draws attention to both his advanced age and—through his fine clothes and portrait in profile (a view then reserved for only the most noble)—his status.Titian inserted a similar self-portrait in which he wore a skull cap in his The Virgin and Child with Saints Titian and Andrew, which he intended for his tomb in Pieve di Cadore.   "
St Margaret and the Dragon is a c.1559 painting by Titian of saint Margaret the Virgin; it is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.
"The Virgin and Child with Saints Dorothy and George is a c.1516 oil on panel painting by Titian, now in the Prado Museum in Madrid, to which it was transferred in 1839.It [SEP] was the first painting by the artist to be acquired by Philip II of Spain, who sent it to the Escorial in 1593. It belongs to the sacra conversazione genre and belongs to a series of portrayals of the Madonna and Child with saints by Titian in the 1510s and 1520s, usually in a horizontal format and intended for private devotion. The model for the figure of Saint Dorothy also appears in several of his half-length allegorical works (Flora and Vanitas for example), possibly the painter's lover.   "
"The Worship of Venus is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Titian completed between 1518 and 1519, housed at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. [SEP] It describes a Roman rite of worship conducted in honour of the goddess Venus each 1 April. On this occasion, women would make offerings to representations of the goddess so as to cleanse ""every blemish on their bodies"".In Titian's work, two nymphs, one young and one matronly, are situated to the right of the ceremony, attending to a shrine holding a representation of Venus. The shrine is surrounded by votive tablets. The older woman checks on the decorations with the use of a mirror which she holds high in her extended right hand. The foreground of the canvas is thronged with a swarm of male infants, or putti, who distract themselves in activities such as climbing trees, leaping, flying, gathering apples, lying around, fighting, fondling, shooting arrows and pulling each other's hair. A dam is shown in the middle background, near a sunlit meadow. The far distance is decorated with a mountain and blue sky. Titian based the image on the writings of the Greek sophist Philostratus. In his ""Imagines I, VI"", Philostratus wrote, ""See cupids are gathering apples: and if there are many of them, do not be surprised...The cupids' quiver are studded with gold, and golden also are the darts in them...they have hung their quivers on the apple trees; and in the grass lie their broidered mantles...Ah, the baskets into which they gather their apples!""    The Feast of Venus (Rubens)   "
"The Aldobrandini Madonna is a painting from about 1509–1510 oil by the Italian renaissance artist Raphael. [SEP]  The picture is of the Virgin Mother, Christ child and infant John the Baptist, one of many paintings by Raphael with this trio.  It is from early in his third, or Roman period, where distinctive changes are seen from his Umbrian or Florentine period in style, use of colour, and introduction of more natural subjects and settings. Owned for centuries by the aristocratic Roman Aldobrandini family, it has been part of the collection of the National Gallery in London since 1865.  It was sold to the National Gallery in 1865 after about five decades of ownership by the Lord and Lady Garvagh, and is still sometimes known as the Garvagh Madonna.    Aldobrandini Madonna,  one of several small and mid-size Madonnas painted by Raphael in Rome, was likely something he worked on in his spare time of projects for the Pope or members of his court.  During this time period, Raphael was painting the Stanza della Segnatura, the first room in the Vatican Palace to receive Raphael and his workshop's frescoes.Exploratory sketches of this and other Madonnas from 1509 to 1511 are found in Raphael's ""pink sketch-book"". It is one of several of Raphael's Madonna and Childs that uses a pyramidal composition. The painting takes place within a room, with a backdrop of the Roman landscape through the windows.  The dark pillar between the windows sets off the bright face of the Madonna who is seated on a bench, holding the Christ child to whom he shares a flower with infant John.  The painting has also been referred to as Madonna del Giglio (of the dianthus or pink) for the flower that infant John gave to the infant Christ.  In addition to the sweetness of the painting, it is well regarded for its grace, beauty and technical skill.  Only the discreet ring halos imply anything other than a very human scene.One topic of conversation has been that the folds of material around the Virgin's lap do not seem to indicate sufficient room for her legs.    Raphael appears to have a special affinity for the relationship between Jesus, the Christ child, and his similarly aged cousin, John.  Likely that was due to the special relationship that they would enjoy as they went through adulthood.  Raphael cloths infant John here, and other paintings of the trio, in a little skin garment, like cloths of the desert as described in The Bible, ""camel's hair and with a girdle of skin about his loins.""In a sweet gesture, the Christ Child sits naturally in the lap of the Virgin, taking the carnation, sign of his future Passion, from Saint John.    The Madonna paintings from his early Roman years evolved from his Umbrian and Florentine Madonnas, are more informal in dress and pose. At the same time, the composition is more complex.  The colors are cooler, jewel-toned, an experiment with the dominant colors of the Stanza della Segnatura's School of Athens and bright, as if on porcelain.The painting contrasts significantly with Raphael's earlier Ansidei Madonna (1505), influenced by the strict expression of divinity of the Umbrian School within his Florentine Period.  Here Madonna is a more human mother, with divinity only expressed through the halo.  The Christ child and Saint John are both children.  The painting is more reflective of natural circumstances. And, yet, there is a severity of this Madonna that will ease into a greater naturalness, such as the Alba Madonna slightly later into Raphael's Roman period.In further contrast to the paintings of his Florentine period, the Madonnas of his Roman period are stronger and more imposing.  This is due in part to the difference between the gaunt woman of Umbria and the beautiful women of Trastevere and Campagna, and also by Raphael's pursuit of the ideal.  He instructed his students that ""we must not represent things as they are, but as they should be.""A strong influence in Raphael's growth as an artist in Rome was Michaelangelo. There are aspects of the composition of Aldobrandini Madonna that are similar to Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna Litta, such as the portrait style painting before two windows that overlook the countryside and style of the Virgin's clothing.    Per Wornum, Aldobrandini Madonna is one of Raphael's paintings that is painted in near perfection, and in the process ""elevated the standard of perfection.""  Raphael executes with such skill, combined with imitative formative art, and the power of invention to reach a noteworthy state of excellence.  While others have surpassed him in execution, Raphael's strengths are his mastery of design and use of invention, composition and expression.    There are several paintings by Raphael with the same trio:   Ansidei Madonna, painted in 1505, is unique in that it shows an adult John the Baptist in the painting with the Christ child. The Virgin and Child with Saint John the Baptist (La belle jardinière), painted in 1507, is at the Louvre, Paris. Madonna with the Blue Diadem Alba Madonna, painted in 1511 during his mature period, is in National Gallery of Art, Washington. Madonna della seggiola Madonna dell'Impannata Madonna della tenda Madonna of the Rose    Provenance refers to the history of ownership of a work of art.  Tracing the provenance tells who owned the painting and can lead to the painting's artist.  Raphael's Aldobrandini Madonna, now of the London National Gallery. In the 16th century the painting was owned by the Aldobrandini family who owned apartments in the Villa Borghese in Rome. Raphael painted a number of Madonnas that passed into the Aldobrandini family; Virgin and Child with Saint John may have been in the collection of Lucrezia d’Este (d. 1598), inventoried in 1592, that came to the Aldobrandinis. The National Gallery's painting is most likely identical to the painting in Jacomo Manilli's Villa Borghese guidebook in 1650 titled ‘Vergine, con Christo, e San Giouannino, ... di Raffaelle’ (‘Virgin with Christ, and Saint John, … by Raphael’).  In the 1780s art critic Basilius von Ramdohr noted that the painting was still kept in Prince Aldobrandini's apartments, verified by the National Gallery to Seroux d’Agincourt's illustrated publication of 1823, which includes a sketch of the painting and states that the painting can be seen at Prince Aldobrandini's apartment, and is notated in the margin:   ""A most precious small painting of his middle period. The composition is very good. The Christ is beautiful, and the Saint John true, only the head of the Madonna compared with the others, is less beautiful. The disegno is most delicate. One notices from the colouring that the master had painted a lot al fresco at that time. The inks are not very much rubbed.""Per the National Gallery, and in contradiction to the Agincourt publication, the painting was acquired by George Canning, 1st Lord Garvagh in 1818 from Alexander Day's collection before it was sold in 1865 to the National Gallery by his widow and heirs for £9,000.

"The Madonna of the Cherries is a 1515 painting by Titian, heavily influenced by the work of Giovanni Bellini. [SEP] Originally oil on wood, it was later transferred to canvas. During the 17th century it formed part of the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, where it was copied by David Teniers. It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

"The Sciarra Madonna is an oil on canvas painting attributed to Titian, signed ""TITIANVS"" and dated to circa 1540. [SEP] It is now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona.  This attribution was accepted by Cavalcaselle, abandoned and then revived by Suida, who noted how the Madonna's pose echoed that in Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Longleat House). Tietze and Berenson argue it is a work by the school of Titian rather than an autograph work.    It is first recorded in the Palazzo Sciarra in Ferrara, from which it was bought in Rome by Francis Cowper. It then passed from his descendants to the Thyssen collection.   "

"Portrait of Laura Dianti is a c. 1520–25 painting by Titian, now held in the H. Kisters Collection at Kreuzlingen. [SEP] It is signed ""TICI/ANVS F."" and depicts Laura Dianti, lover and later wife of Alfonso I d'Este. Titian painted several portraits of Dianti, perhaps including the Woman with a Mirror, now at the Louvre. In this one, she wears a sumptuous blue dress, jewellery and a diadem. Her right arm runs down the side of her body while her left hand rests on the shoulder of an African page boy.    Vasari mentions a portrait of Dianti, which was engraved by E. Sadler. Ridolfi, in 1648, described the work based on the engraving. There are several copies and versions of the painting, one of which (generally thought to be the autograph version) was sent in 1599 from Cesare d'Este to Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague. In 1649, it was in the collection of Christina of Sweden, who brought it to Rome in 1654. It then passed into the collections of Decio Azzolino, then (in 1686) of prince Odescalchi, then (in 1721) Philip of Orleans. In 1800, it was in an English collection and in 1876, it was in the Cook collection before arriving in the Kisters collection in Kreuzlingen. Modern criticism previously held the work to be an autograph copy of a lost original, like the versions at the Galleria Estense in Modena, the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, the Galleria Borghese in Rome and several private collections. After a restoration in America, which revealed the signature on the sleeve, it is again thought to be the original work. The work was paired with a portrait of Alfonso I d'Este, which is now lost but of which several copies survive, the best perhaps being that at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City.   "

Its subject was a son of Pope Paul III, dressed in the armour and accoutrements of a papal gonfaloniere.

"Francesco Maria I della Rovere (25 March 1490 – 20 October 1538) was an Italian condottiero, who was Duke of Urbino from 1508 to 1516 and, after retaking the throne from Lorenzo II de' Medici, from 1521 to 1538. [SEP]    He was born in Senigallia, the son of the Papal captain and lord of that city, Giovanni della Rovere, and of Giovanna da Montefeltro, daughter of Federico III da Montefeltro. He was also the nephew of Giuliano della Rovere, Pope Julius II.  His uncle Guidobaldo I of Urbino, who was heirless, called him at his court, and named him as heir of that dukedom in 1504 through the intercession of Julius II. In 1502 the della Rovere had lost the seigniory of Senigallia, occupied by Cesare Borgia, then the most powerful figure in the Marche: Francesco Maria and his mother were saved from the slaughter perpetrated by Borgia's troops by the then-land soldier Andrea Doria. When in 1508 Guidobaldo died, Francesco Maria became duke of Urbino; thanks to the support of his uncle the pope he could also recover Senigallia after Borgia's death. In 1508 he married Eleonora Gonzaga (1493–1570), daughter of Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua and Isabella d'Este.  In 1509 he was appointed as capitano generale (commander-in-chief) of the Papal States, and subsequently fought in the Italian Wars against Ferrara and Venice. In 1511, after he had failed to conquer Bologna, he had the cardinal Francesco Alidosi killed by his troops, a cruel action for which he was compared to Borgia himself. In 1513 he was created also lord of Pesaro. However, the death of Julius II deprived him of his main political patron, and under the new pope, Leo X, Pesaro was given to the latter's nephew, Lorenzo II de' Medici. In 1516 he was excommunicated and ousted from Urbino, which he tried unsuccessfully to recover the following year. He could return in his duchy only after Leo's death in 1521.  Della Rovere fought as captain general of the Republic of Venice in Lombardy during the Italian Wars of 1521 (1523–1525), but with the new Medici Pope, Clement VII, the della Rovere were increasingly marginalized. As supreme commander of the Holy League, his inaction against the Imperial invasion troops is generally listed as one of the causes of the Sack of Rome (1527). He was a protagonist of the capture of Pavia in the late 1520s, and later fought for the Republic of Venice. Later he arranged the marriage of son Guidobaldo to Giulia da Varano (belonging to another former seigniory family of the region) to counter the Papal power in the Marche. He died in Pesaro, poisoned.  Some scholars suggest that The Murder of Gonzago, an unknown play referenced in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, which is itself later reworked by Hamlet into The Mousetrap (the play within the play), may have been a popular theatrical reenactment of Della Rovere's death and may have been portrayed in England's early theaters during the Elizabethan Era.

"Ippolito de' Medici (1511 – 10 August 1535) was the only son of Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici, born out-of-wedlock to his mistress Pacifica Brandano. [SEP]    Ippolito was born in Urbino. His father died when he was only five (1516), and he was subsequently raised by his uncle Pope Leo X and his cousin Giulio de' Medici. When Giulio was elected pope as Clement VII in 1523, Ippolito ruled Florence on his behalf (1524–1527). After the siege of Florence (1529–1530), however, Clement favored his nephew Alessandro de' Medici as the family member to take charge of Florence.  To assist and succeed him in church affairs, Clement VII created his cousin Ippolito a cardinal  on 10 January 1529, and on the same day named him first Archbishop of Avignon, a position that brought him a considerable income.  Since he was only eighteen, he could not be consecrated a bishop or even be the administrator of the diocese without a papal dispensation. Ippolito was named Cardinal Priest of Santa Prassede, though there is no evidence that he was ever ordained a priest or consecrated as a bishop.  His own preference was to be ruler of Florence, not a cleric, and he spent the rest of his life trying to renounce his clerical calling and depose his cousin Alessandro.  On 3 May 1529, Cardinal Ippolito was named Papal Legate in Perugia.On 12 August 1529, Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici was one of the three Cardinal Legates who met Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at Genoa with the purpose of conducting him in state to his coronation as Emperor in Bologna.  In Bologna, he participated in the ceremonies of the coronation.On 15 February 1530, Pope Clement granted Cardinal Ippolito a ⅓ share in the annual papal income from the town and territory of Chiusi for his lifetime.Ippolito was sent to Hungary in the spring of 1532 as Papal Legate, departing from Rome on 8 July, according to the diaries of the Italian literatus Pietro Aretino.  He was in Regensburg by 12 August. There he demonstrated a talent for soldiering, leading 8000 Hungarian soldiers against the Ottoman Turks, though the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent was unwilling to move forward so late in the season, and the Emperor Charles V only had sufficient forces for defense, not offence.  When the Emperor returned to Italy early in the next year, Cardinal Ippolito followed him.On 3 July 1532, Cardinal Ippolito was named Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, the most lucrative office in the Roman Curia. Along with that post he was transferred to the Titular church of San Lorenzo in Damaso.He was a friend to, and possibly had a liaison with, Giulia Gonzaga, the Countess of Fondi. He loved Catherine de' Medici, but they never married. Alessandro de' Medici once caught him and Catherine de' Medici in a private embrace. However, when he was sent away as a Cardinal, they weren't allowed to see each other any longer. Some theories suggest that the reason Clement made Ippolito Cardinal was to keep him and Catherine de' Medici apart.  By 24 April 1531, Catherine had been promised to Henry, the son of King Francis I of France, in a draft contract of marriage.  Catherine was 11, and Cardinal Ippolito was 21. Ippolito's cousin, Pope Clement, died on 25 September 1534. The Conclave elected Cardinal Alessandro Farnese on October 12, and he chose the name Paul III. In 1535, free of his cousin's influence, Cardinal Ippolito acted as Florentine ambassador to Emperor Charles V, happily conveying complaints against the administration of Alessandro de' Medici.  Suffering from a low-grade fever for eight days, Ippolito died from malaria in Itri, in southern Lazio, although there were rumors that he had been poisoned either by Alessandro de' Medici, whose abuses he was intending to denounce, or by Pope Paul III, who aimed to acquire Ippolito's lucrative benefices for his own nephews.

"Portrait of Isabella d'Este (or Isabella in Black) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Italian painter Titian, completed between 1534 and 1536. [SEP] It shows the Marquess of Mantua,  Isabella d'Este, daughter of  Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Eleanor of Naples with an ermine zibellino draped over her shoulder.  Although Titian depicts her as a young woman, she was around 62 at the time  Isabella was socially ambitious and aware of the effect a painting by a renowned artists might have on her reputation and prestige - she also commissioned portraits by Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea Mantegna.It is one of two portraits Titian painted of her; Isabella in Red (or Aged Isabella) of 1529 is known only through a Peter Paul Rubens copy. It showed a more aged and matronly Isabella, but she was so displeased with the picture that she asked for a second idealised portrait, showing how she thought she looked forty years earlier. Art historian Lionel Cust mentions that Isabella's fame and renown was not due to ""beauty, but to intellect and character"". Fred Kleiner wrote that the work is a ""distinctive portrayal of his poised and self-assured patron that owes little to its model"". It is today in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.    Isabella was portrayed a number times in her youth. She was betrothed to Francesco Gonzaga in 1480 when she was 6; they married when she was 16. She was painted by Cosme Tura as a child and on a number of occasions around the time of her wedding, a period during which she was honoured by the striking of a commemorative medal. She was critical of a portrait by Andrea Mantegna completed after 1493, and by the 1510s became very weary of representations of her likeness. She seems to have feared the effects of age, and a short woman, worried she was getting stout.  She retained very strong ideas for the rest of her life as to how she should be portrayed. From the 1520s she asked that she be painted from written descriptions - with the rationale that words captured more closely a person's essence than life sittings. This was convenient for Titian, who was much sought after as a portraitist, disliked travel, and anyway prided himself on the fact that he could capture a likeness from written description. Nonetheless, she rejected his first portrait, the now lost Isabella in red of 1529, feeling it did not flatter, and five years later asked that he paint a second. The complaints registered of the first painting indicate that the last thing sought by the patron was anything approaching a likeness. There was displeasure with the portrayal of her nose, posture, costume, facial expression, and the highlighting of her squint.  Isabella sought to influence Titian by sending him a 1511 portrait painted by Francesco Francia, which shows her as a young woman and highlighted her girlish beauty. This work was in turn based on an even earlier portrait (probably Lorenzo Costa or Leonardo's drawing) and her half-sister Lucrezia d'Este-Bentivoglio's oral description. Francia was given the opportunity to travel to Mantua so that Isabella could sit, but he declined, believing that he would paint better from the drawing and written description. This was convenient for Isabella, who wrote to him that he had ""indeed made us far more beautiful by your art than nature ever made us"". Yet she had later doubts that this work was how she was to be definitely seen and remembered by; she believed it made her eyes look ""too black"" and that the shadows were too heavy, and asked that both be lightened.Titian was assisted by Gian Giorgio Trissino's written description of Isabella. She was so pleased with Titian's second depiction that she wrote, ""The portrait by Titian's hand is of such a pleasing type that we doubt that we were ever, at the age he represents, of such beauty that is contained in it.""Others were not so impressed by the obvious deceit of the final Isabella in Black. Contemporary writer and satirist Pietro Aretino described the final painting as  ""dishonestly ugly"" and a ""supremely dishonestly embellished"" that displayed undeserved ""white teeth"" and ""ivory eyelashes"". Art historians examining the work tend to focus on her vanity, while largely acknowledging that court women of the time were on public display and expected to be physically pleasing and personally charming while at the same time showing signs of modesty and chastity. This was not the first time that Titian had flattered a sitter with a rejuvenated, retrospective, or idealised image; his portrait of Philip II of Spain shows the king, who was puny in life, as a military hero bathed by light to grant both an aura to the hero and an actual halo.     Portrait of Isabella d'Este is described as a portrait of the Queen of Cyprus (inventory list of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria in 1659) and was identified by an inscription on an etching by Lucas Vorsterman of a copy by Peter Paul Rubens. This identification is denied by Titian experts Leandro Ozzola and Wilhelm Suida. Ozzola identified Titian's La Bella (Palazzo Pitti, Florence) as the youthful portrait, because of the more cajoling idealisation and similarities to other portraits of Isabella (i.e. 'Ambras Miniature', KHM Vienna).  Rona Goffey identified Isabella based on the sleeve knots of her gown, which contain a pattern known to have been commissioned by her. Other identifying clues include the characteristic plunging neckline and elaborate headdress, but the related portrait by Giulio Romano 1531 (now in the Royal Collection, London) changed identification from Isabella d'Este to Margaret Paleologa in the last years. The light-gray of her eyes contrasts to the other portraits in which her eyes are brown.     Titian second painting concentrates on her high social rank, her forceful personality, intelligence and on second hand accounts of her beauty. Isabella was a collector of antique and contemporary art, and as a powerful patron of culture was in part responsible for developing a highly refined court in Mantua. Because of this Titian, as a sometimes commissioned painter, would have been economically dependent, and so keen to flatter and pay tribute to his sitter. Although she is portrayed as a beautiful, much younger woman, the viewer is left in no doubt as to her elevated social status and cultural sophistication. She has a small rounded mouth, large oval eyes and dark, arched eyebrows. She has pale skin but rosy cheeks, and a dimple at the end of her chin. There is a duality in her facial expression; although she has soft features, her strong and forceful personality is evident, accentuated by the fact that her body is stiff and she sits upright, giving her an air of the imperious.Her red hair is bound in an updo, and she wears a sumptuous balzo headdress. Her gown is richly embroidered with velvet over a ribbon-edged guimp. She is holding an ermine zibellino and her sleeves are decorated with gold and silver brocade. In places the silk is lined with jewels. The work reflects Titian's tendency to emphasis his subject's hands, with the elaborately decorated and finely detailed sleeves serve to draw the viewers attention towards her hands.The portrait was in the collection of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria who had it engraved in 1656 for his Theatrum Pictorium, though the zibellino was turned into a feather.

"Portrait of Vincenzo Mosti is a painting by Titian, executed around 1520 and now housed in the Galleria Palatina of Florence, Italy. [SEP]    The work is mentioned in the gallery's 1687 inventory as a ""copy of Titian believed to be original"". In that of 1815, it is attributed to the Venetian School and in that of 1829 to an unknown artist. It has been reassigned to Titian after the elimination of the repaintures. The subject is traditionally identified as Tommaso Mosti, a member of a family connected with the Este of Ferrara, based on an inscription in the reverse which says ""Di Thomaso Mosti in età di anni XXV l'anno MDXXVI. Thitiano de Cadore pittore"". However, the historical Mosti followed an ecclesiastical career, and thus the garments of the subject are not appropriate. More likely, the man could be his elder brother Vincenzo, who died in 1536, or Agostino. The dating in the inscription (1526) would be an error of transcription of a ""0"" as a ""6"".

Titian drew on his own Philip II in Armour (Prado Museum) for the work,  which may have been produced around 1554.An autographed copy of the Naples work hangs in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.   "
"The Portrait of Jacopo Strada is a 1567-68 portrait of the court librarian Jacopo Strada by Titian, now held in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.Strada [SEP] was not only an official book keeper, but also had many other qualities, and this portrait portrays him in his study surrounded by objects displaying his knowledge. He is shown wearing a gold chain, probably awarded him the previous year 1566 when he was appointed Antiquarius Caesareus by his employer Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. The inscription upper right reads JACOBVUS DE STRADA CIVIS ROMANVS CAESS. ANTIQVARIVS ET COM. BELIC. AN: AETAT: LI: et C.M.D.L.

The letter on the table additionally contains the words Titian Vecellio Venezia. A century later this painting was documented in David Teniers the Younger's catalog Theatrum Pictorium of the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in 1659 and again in 1673, but the portrait had already enjoyed notoriety in Teniers' portrayals of the Archduke's art collection:  		 		 		 		   "
"Portrait of Clarissa Strozzi is a portrait by the Italian painter Titian from 1542 belonging to the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin. [SEP] The painting depicts a girl from the old Florentine family of Strozzi. The girl seems slightly frightened and holds onto her little Phalene dog. By some it is considered an example of one of the most beautiful child portraits in the world thanks to colouring and specifically the combination of colours carmine red, blue and golden yellow. This canvas is considered an inspiration for similar paintings by Anthony van Dyck.   "
"Self-Portrait is an oil on canvas self-portrait by the Venetian painter Titian, dated c. 1546–47. [SEP] While he is known to have painted a number of independent self-portraits in various formats, this is one of only two painted examples to survive. The other is in Madrid, dated c. 1560. Both share a   somber and reserved pallet, although this example is richer in tonal variation and colour harmonisation.It is unfinished, with his left hand, areas of his clothing only sketched and only roughly sketched. It has been suggested that the canvas is a modello, or study, for another now lost work. Another theory is that it was painted for family members for his memory after he died. Thematically and stylistically, the work can be associated with his 1545 Portrait of Pietro Aretino. A number of versions or variants exist, including drawings from his own hand, and paintings attributed to his workshop.     Parts of the canvas are unfinished, especially the hands, the dark area around his face, and the drapery. It remained in Titian's studio in the Biri Grande, Venice, until his death, which some art historian see as evidence that it was intended as a study, although it may just have been simply because it was unfinished.The Italian painter, architect, and writer Giorgio Vasari wrote in 1568 that Titian had made a number of self-portraits for his family to remember him by, and it is likely that this was one, given that it was not sold in his lifetime. However Vasari dates the portrait to c. 1562–64, this work more closely corresponds to a records of a version of a portrait given to Paolo Giovio in 1549.    The painting's style is reminiscent of Titian's work of around 1560, especially the thick and irregular application of white paint in large sections.  He seems to be around 60 years old, giving credence to the earlier dating. He wears the golden chain of the Order of the Golden Spur, wrapped in three strands, which was given to him by the Emperor Charles V in 1533. The chain is intended to signify his knighthood and elevated social status. He wears a black cap in both paintings; a motif seen a number of other of his later works. While the origins of the motif are unknown, it is probably intend to connect him with scholarship; similar headgear is often associated with Aristotle and St Jerome. A further explanation is that he sough to cover up a bald spot.  The portrait is in half length, with Titian in three-quarters profile view, seated behind a table, looking out into the distance. Although his expression is complex and hard to properly interpret, it can be viewed as a more outward looking and optimistic expression the 1567 Madrid self-portrait, and a number of art historians note the aging and physical decline he had undergone by the time of the later work. As with all of his independent self-portraits, he is looking to the side, avoiding the viewer, possibly out of humility, but in a dignified pose. He is shown with strong shoulders and a keen, alert gaze, in which some detect an air ""of combativeness...disquietude...and misgiving"".Unlike the Madrid canvas, the portrait does not refer to his occupation as a painter, although art historian David Rosand believes that ""instead of an implement of his craft, however, the open brushwork itself declares the painter's art"". Further, the emphasis on his hands may reference that as a painter his talent derived from them.That the canvas is unfinished gives insight into Titian's working methods and techniques.    The painting was acquired by the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin from the English Solly collection in the early 1820s.   "

"The Young Woman in a Black Dress is an oil painting by Titian, dating to around 1520 and now held at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. [SEP] It was later misattributed to Palma il Vecchio, then to Giovanni Cariani, until Roberto Longhi reattributed it as by Titian, which is now the critical consensus. It depicts a woman half-length, facing the viewer, with her torso slightly twisted to give a sense of movement. One hand holds her black dress over her white shift, with a generous cleavage. The woman's physical type recurs in several other works by the artist, such as Flora and Woman with a Mirror - she may have been Titian's mistress, or simply a recurring model.   "
"Giovanni Dalmata (Croatian: Ivan Duknović; c. 1440 – c. 1514), born Ioannes Stephani Duknovich de Tragurio, also known as Giovanni Duknovich di Traù in Italy and Ivan Stjepanov Duknović in Croatia, was a sculptor from Trogir, Dalmatia, who was mainly active in Rome, Hungary and in Dalmatia. [SEP] Giovanni Dalmata was, with Mino da Fiesole and Andrea Bregno, the leading sculptor in Rome in the second half of the 15th century.    He was born in Vinišće, a Dalmatian village (now a part of Marina) in Venetian Dalmatia around 1440. His father was Stjepan Duknović, a stonemason in Trogir. He came to Rome between 1460 and 1465 to work for Pope Paul II on the Palazzo di Venezia. Other works in and around Rome include: the Tempietto of S. Giacomo in Vicovaro (near Tivoli), the tomb monuments of Pope Paul II in St. Peter's (now dismantled), the tomb of Cardinal Bartolomeo della Rovere in San Clemente, the tomb of Cardinal Bernardo Eroli (now in the Grotte Vaticane). Around 1488–1490, Giovanni went to the Court of King Matthias Corvinus in Buda, where he stayed for a few years, mastering a number of works which are unfortunately all either completely destroyed or badly damaged (e.g. the Fountain of Hercules in Visegrád). After his stay in Hungary, Giovanni Dalmata returned to Trogir (Traù in Italian) where he left a number of works, most important among those is the statue of St. John the Evangelist in the Orsini Chapel in Trogir Cathedral. He is also the creator of the sculpture of St. Magdalene in the Franciscan monastery of St. Anthony on the nearby Čiovo island and worked with Nicolò Fiorentino and Andrea Alessi on the Renaissance Cippico Palace in Trogir. Around 1503, he was in Rome again, working on the tomb of the papal protonotary Lomellino. In 1509 he executed the tomb of the Beato Giannelli for S. Ciriaco in Ancona. Some documents of 1513 and 1514 refer to one ""Magistro Joanni lapicida"" in Trogir where he presumably died soon afterwards. A newly discovered work (The Virgin and Child, a marble relief) was offered on auction in London's Katz gallery and bought for £250,000 by Trogir City Museum. The authenticity of this work must remain doubtful.   "

"Enrico Contarini (died 15 November 1108) was an Venetian priest who was Bishop of Castello from 1074 to 1108. [SEP]    Enrico Contarini  was the son of the Doge Domenico Contarini of the aristocratic Venetian family (House of Contarini). He was appointed Bishop of Olivolo or Rialto in 1074. That year the Bishop of Olivolo began to be styled the Bishop of Castello. Enrico Contarini was the first to hold this title.The Doge Vitale Michiel (1096-1112) held back from participating in the First Crusade until he saw the amount of loot that the Genoese and Pisans were bringing back from Palestine. In 1099 Enrico Contarini was the spiritual leader of the fleet of about 200 ships that Michiel sent to assist in the crusade in the Levant.  The fleet sailed to Rhodes, where it wintered.  The emperor of Byzantium asked the Venetians not to proceed, but the bishop overcame any who were inclined to listen to this request.In the spring of 1100 the fleet went on to Myra in Asia Minor, where they obtained the remains of Saint Nicholas, his uncle Nicholas and Saint Theodore the Martyr. They went on to the Holy Land, then returned to Venice, which they reached on 6 December 1100. With Saint Nicholas the Bishop obtained a patron saint to rival the Doge's Saint Mark. Theodore the Martyr became one of the four tutelary guardians of Venice, along with the angel Gabriel, the Virgin Mary and Saint Mark the Evangelist.Enrico Contarini died in office on 15 November 1108.

"Paolo Foscari was a Venetian noble and churchman, who rose to become Bishop of Castello in 1367–1375, and Latin Archbishop of Patras from 1375 until his death in 1393/4. In the latter capacity he played a leading role in the affairs of the Principality of Achaea. [SEP]       He was a son of Giovanni Foscari, a member of the noble Foscari family. Nothing is known about his early life, except that he studied civil and canon law in the University of Padua, where he may also have taught as a professor for a time.He chose an ecclesiastical career, and on 19 August 1365 the Venetian Senate recommended him for the position of Latin Archbishop of Patras in the Morea in southern Greece. The Archbishop of Patras was a powerful figure in Latin Greece: he was not only the pre-eminent Catholic see of the Morea, but also, having acquired the secular barony of Patras in c. 1276 and added its 24 fiefs to his own eight, the most important of the Principality of Achaea's feudatories. From the time of Archbishop William Frangipani (1317–1337) in particular, Patras enjoyed close relations with Venice and acted practically independent from the Prince. When the Angevin bailli tried to impose his authority over the city shortly after, the intervention of the Pope resulted in the effective independence of the Archbishop from Achaea and his direct subordination to the Pope. For the remainder of the century, the Archbishops of Patras played an active role in the intrigues and feuds of the Principality, and in turn the contending families often tried to place one of their own scions on the archiepiscopal throne. Foscari lost the position to Angelo I Acciaioli, a relative of the previous incumbent, John III Acciaioli, and adoptive son of the grand seneschal Niccolò Acciaioli, whose family was spreading its influence in the Morea at this time.On 24 April 1366, after another recommendation of the Senate to the Pope, he was chosen instead as bishop of the See of Coron, a Venetian colony in the southwestern Morea. He remained at Coron for about a year, before returning to Venice, where on 7 May 1367 he assumed the post of Bishop of Castello.    As Bishop of Castello (in effect the residing bishop of Venice), he entered into a protracted conflict with the authorities of the Republic of Venice over the so-called ""death tax"", a tithe over a deceased person's property payable to the Church by his relatives. The controversy was simmering since the outbreak of the Black Death in 1348, but Foscari fanned it anew. The civil authorities in Venice vehemently opposed the tithe, and forbade it outright on 29 August 1368, leading to a complete breakdown of relations between the Republic and the Church, as Popes Urban V and Gregory XI backed Foscari. An attempt by his father, Giovanni, to mediate between the two sides, only resulted in the Senate voting to give him an ultimatum of three months, under pain of perpetual banishment for him and his sons and the confiscation of all his property, to bring his son to heel. The conflict was only resolved in 1377, by which time Paolo Foscari had been transferred (on 26 November 1375) to the Archbishopric of Patras.    From his new post Paolo played a leading role in the affairs of the Latin states of southern Greece. In 1376 or 1377, the bailli of the Principality of Achaea, Centurione I Zaccaria, died, and Foscari was chosen to replace him by Queen Joanna I of Naples. He did not remain long in the post, however; desiring to place Achaea in hands more capable of defending it, in summer 1376 Queen Joanna sold the principality for five years to the Knights Hospitaller, and (at the latest in summer 1377) sent Daniel del Caretto to the Morea as her new bailli, to oversee the transfer of power. The newly elected Grand master of the Hospitallers, Juan Fernández de Heredia, arrived in the Morea in late 1377. Foscari lent him troops for an expedition against Lepanto, held by the Albanian chieftain John Spata; the campaign was a failure, however, as Heredia was taken prisoner by Spata, sold to the Turks, and had to be ransomed. By 1380, Lepanto too was back in Albanian hands, and in 1381, the Hospitallers returned the government of the Principality of Achaea to Queen Joanna.The failure of the Hospitaller enterprise inaugurated a period of turmoil for Achaea, complicated by the arrival of the mercenary Navarrese Company and the effects of the Western Schism between Pope Urban VI and Antipope Clement VII. Queen Joanna having recognized Clement VII, she was deposed and killed by Charles III, who was supported by Urban VI. Achaea passed under the control of titular Latin Emperor James of Baux, who appointed the leader of the Navarrese Company, Mahiot de Coquerel, as his bailli. When James died in 1383, Mahiot recognized Charles III as suzerain. Foscari remained loyal to Urban VI; as a result, on 26 September 1384 he was declared deposed by Clement VII, however without any practical consequences to his position. In the same year, he was sent as papal envoy to reconcile the local Orthodox Church of Thessalonica, which was being besieged by the Ottoman Turks.In early 1386, Charles III died, after having fallen out with Urban VI, who had declared him deposed. As a result, Urban VI confiscated the Principality of Achaea and on 6 September 1387, Foscari was appointed vicar-general on behalf of the Pope, and authorized to hire the Navarrese Company on his own account. The Pope envisioned to use the Navarrese to wage war on the Greeks of the Despotate of the Morea, and at the same stroke find for them employment and lands beyond those of the Principality of Achaea. In the event,the title was an empty formality, and real power in the principality remained with the Navarrese Company and its leaders. Foscari's role was more as an agent of Venice in the Morea, in whose affairs the Republic showed an ever-growing interest, and where they sought to expand their territory; thus in 1388, the Venetians acquired the lordship of Argos and Nauplia in the northeastern Morea. For this purpose, Foscari continued to receive soldiers and arms from Venice to support his position.In the meantime, the pretenders to the Principality multiplied: Mary of Blois sold the Principality again to the Hospitallers on behalf of her son, Louis II of Anjou, but the sale was disputed by another rival, Amadeus of Piedmont, who succeeded in getting Clement VII to annul it. Amadeus made treaties with Venice, the Navarrese, the Greek Despot of the Morea, and Nerio I Acciaioli, but in the event, the death of his cousin Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1391 meant that he never embarked for Greece. Likewise another pretender, Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, who might have rallied the Principality behind him, was caught up in the French expedition against the Barbary pirates in 1390 and abandoned his plans. The long interregnum lasted until 1396, when Mahiot's successor, Pedro de San Superano, received recognition as hereditary Prince of Achaea from King Ladislaus of Naples.Throughout the period, Foscari continued to promote Venetian interests in the Morea: on 27 February 1393, a secret resolution of the Venetian Senate instructed Foscari to seek an alliance with Nerio Acciaioli and the Despot of the Morea, Theodore I Palaiologos, against the Navarrese Company. Foscari died sometime after that, but before 7 April 1394, when the See of Patras is reported as vacant.   "
"Giovanni Polani (died 1164) was Bishop of Castello, Italy, from 1133 to 1164. [SEP] He was engaged in a long-running dispute over jurisdiction with Enrico Dandolo, the Patriarch of Grado.    Giovanni Polani was a kinsman of the Doge of Venice, Pietro Polani (r. 1130–1148). He became bishop of Castello in 1133. In this position Polani had direct jurisdiction over the parishes of Venice. Polani supported reform. In 1138 he gave the San Danielle parish church to Manfredo, a Cistercian from Fruttuaria abbey in San Benigno Canavese in Piedmont, so he could build a monastery. The monks established their monastery near the Cathedral of San Pietro di Castello, and the income from the church helped support it. The monks agreed to respect and pay tithes to the diocese.Polani became engaged in a dispute with Enrico Dandolo, the Patriarch of Grado. Eventually these clashes, which also involved the Doge, would culminate in the exile of the patriarch. In 1139, encouraged by Dandolo, the clergy of the ancient church of San Salvatore in central Venice decided to become canons regular under the rule of St. Augustine. The diocese had less control over such semi-monastic communities, some of which were directly linked to Rome. The clergy failed to confirm their subordination to the diocese. Polani was furious at what he saw as an attempt to take this important parish away from his control, and placed it under interdict.  In response, Dandolo placed it under his metropolitan protection. On 13 May 1141 Pope Innocent II lifted the interdict, placed San Salvatore under his personal protection and sent two canons to instruct the congregation in the rule.In 1141 Dandolo placed and blessed the foundation stone of the complex holding a church and hostel for pilgrims on the Isola di San Clemente. The island was given to canons regular. Dandolo expected it would come under the patriarchate of Grado, and this became a long-running cause of dispute with Polani. Eventually, in 1156 Polani was forced by the Pope to relinquish all claims against the church of San Clemente. He died in 1164.   "
"Stefano Bonsignori or Bonsignore O.SS.C.A. [SEP] (23 February 1738, Busto Arsizio - 23 December 1826, Faenza) was an Italian cleric, bishop and theologian. Napoleon I appointed him patriarch of Venice, but this appointment was not confirmed by the Holy See.       A son of the cotton merchant Giovanni Battista Bonsignori and his wife Giovanna Galeazzi, he began his education under an uncle who was a priest, before moving to the Archepiscopal Seminary of Milan. In 1759 he entered the oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles and was ordained priest at the end of 1760. He served as a grammar teacher at the seminaries in Celana and Gorla, then as a rhetoric and theology teacher at the main seminary in Milan and the Helvetic College. During this time he became part of the circle of scholars gathered by cardinal Angelo Maria Durini - others included count Karl Joseph von Firmian, archbishop Giuseppe Pozzobonelli and Carlo Trivulzio. He became an orator, epigraphist and church historian and in 1774 was made doctor of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. The following year he graduated in theology from the University of Pavia. In 1791, after the seminaries reopened following the limitations on the general seminary, he was made professor of dogmatic theology and prefect of studies, with a substantial salary. He became a noted and rich orator and theologian and in 1797 he was admitted to the prestigious Metropolitan Chapter as a canon theologian. This period of success soon stopped, however, with the founding of the Cisalpine Republic, the abolition of cathedral chapters and the confiscation of their goods. Probably thanks to contacts with politicians, Bonsignori gained a 1,200 lire pension and met Napoleon after he came to Milan following his victory at the battle of Marengo. He gained the general's sympathy and accompanied archbishop Filippo Maria Visconti to the Consulte de Lyon as an advisor.    Thanks to Francesco Melzi d'Eril, vice-president of the new Italian Republic, he gained several important posts in the following years, as part of Melzi's attempts to reinstate those linked to the aristocratic world swept away by the Cisalpine Republic. In a list of names proposed as diocesan bishops in Italy, Melzi wrote by Bonsignori's name ""one of ours"". Whilst he waited for the 1801 Concordat to come into force, Bonsignori became a member of the Istituto Nazionale and vice-director of the Biblioteca di Brera. Only on 5 April 1806 did Napoleon nominate him to be bishop of Faenza, confirmed on 18 September 1807 by pope Pius VII. He was consecrated as a bishop by archbishop Antonio Codronchi on 27 December 1807 and on 13 March the following year took possession of his diocese. He was one of the most pro-French bishops, albeit in a passive form, even when the First French Empire annexed the Papal States and when Pius was put under house arrest after excommunicating Napoleon. This put him at odds with Pius' attempts at resistance. He even wrote a letter to his diocese's parish priests in 1810 praising a circular by the Minister of Religion and ascribing civil marriage the same value as church marriage. He was suitably rewarded with the titles of count, baron, commander of the Order of the Iron Crown and Grand Official of the Kingdom of Italy. This culminated in Napoleon's nomination of him as Patriarch of Venice on 9 February 1811, without approval from the pope, who continued to see him as only bishop of Faenza. Bonsignori reached the Lagoon on 9 April but did not spend much time there, since on 5 May he reached Paris for a council, where he acted as secretary and made no major interventions. He was similarly passive at the later deputation of Savona between October 1811 and February 1812. In 1813 he reached Pius in his captivity at Fontainebleau, but again took no active part in the negotiations for the new concordat.    After Napoleon's first fall in 1814 Bonsignori renounced his loyalty to him and withdrew his statements about civil marriage. He left Venice on 5 May 1814 and made a sermon at Faenza Cathedral confessing his guilt. Pius then sentenced him to a year in which he was not allowed to hold pontifical masses, after which he was allowed to return to his diocese. He became a strong supporter of Pius' attempts to return to the pre-Napoleonic status quo - he rebuilt the college of urban parish priests, restored the suppressed monasteries and parishes and opened new monasteries at Bagnacavallo and at Fognano, Brisighella. He later reorganised the episcopal seminary, leaving it his collection of books and manuscripts.   "

"Matteo Zane (died 1605) was the Patriarch of Venice from 1600 to 1605. [SEP]    Prior to his election as Patriarch Zane had served the government of Venice.  He had been ambassador or holder of similar office to Urbino, Portugal, Spain, Austria and the Ottoman Empire.  In the case of the Ottoman Empire he held the office of Bailo in Constantinople, which was considered the key position in the Venetian foreign service.  The bailo acted as both ambassador and consul, not only representing the political interests of Venice but seeking the protection and stability of Venice's merchants in Constantinople.  He also supervised all other consuls of Venice throughout the Ottoman Empire.  While serving as Bailo Zane expanded the number of consuls under his direction from nine to 10. Zane lacked the degree in either theology or canon law mandated by the Council of Trent.  Negotiations by Venice got this requirement waived and managed to postpone Zane's examination on theology by the Pope and panel of cardinals, as required of all Italian bishops at that time, until 1601.  Zane was able to pass the examination at that time.   "

"San Michele is an island in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy. [SEP]  It is associated with the sestiere of Cannaregio, from which it lies a short distance northeast.    Along with neighbouring San Cristoforo della Pace, the island was a popular place for local travellers and fishermen  to land.  Mauro Codussi's Chiesa di San Michele in Isola of 1469, the first Renaissance church in Venice, and a monastery lie on the island, which also served for a time  as a prison. San Cristoforo was selected to become a cemetery in 1807, designed by Gian Antonio Selva, when under French occupation it was decreed that burial on the mainland (or on the main Venetian islands) was unsanitary.  The canal that separated the two islands was filled in during 1836, and subsequently the larger island became known as San Michele. Bodies were carried to the island on special funeral gondolas. Among those buried there are Igor Stravinsky, Joseph Brodsky, Jean Schlumberger, Christian Doppler, Frederick Rolfe, Horatio Brown, Sergei Diaghilev, Ezra Pound, Luigi Nono, Catherine Bagration, Franco Basaglia, Paolo Cadorin, Zoran Mušič, Helenio Herrera, Emilio Vedova, and Salvador de Iturbide y Marzán.  The cemetery is still in use today.    The cemetery contains 7 war graves from World War I of officers and seamen of the British merchant and Royal Navy.Aspasia Manos was initially interred at the cemetery of Isola di San Michele. Her remains were later transferred to the Royal Cemetery Plot in the park of Tatoi Palace. Other attractions include the Cappella Emiliana chapel.   "

"The Doge of Venice (; Venetian: Doxe de Venexia [ˈdɔze de veˈnɛsja]; Italian: Doge di Venezia [ˈdɔːdʒe di veˈnɛttsja]; all derived from Latin dūx, ""military leader""), sometimes translated as Duke (compare the Italian Duca), was the chief magistrate and leader of the Republic of Venice between 726 and 1797. [SEP] Doges of Venice were elected for life by the city-state's aristocracy. The doge was neither a duke in the modern sense, nor the equivalent of a hereditary duke. The title ""doge"" was the title of the senior-most elected official of Venice and Genoa; both cities were republics and elected doges. A doge was referred to variously by the titles ""My Lord the Doge"" (Monsignor el Doxe), ""Most Serene Prince"" (Serenissimo Principe), and ""His Serenity"" (Sua Serenità).       The first historical Venetian doge, Ursus, led a revolt against the Byzantine Empire in 726, but was soon recognised as the dux (duke) and hypatos (consul) of Venice by imperial authorities. After Ursus, the Byzantine office of magister militum (stratelates in Greek) was restored for a time until Ursus' son Deusdedit was elected duke in 742. Byzantine administration in Italy collapsed in 751. In the latter half of the eighth century, Mauritius Galba was elected duke and took the title magister militum, consul et imperialis dux Veneciarum provinciae, master of the soldiers, consul and imperial duke of the province of Venetiae. Doge Justinian Partecipacius (d. 829) used the title imperialis hypatus et humilis dux Venetiae, imperial consul and humble duke of Venice.These early titles combined Byzantine honorifics and explicit reference to Venetia's subordinate status.  Titles like hypatos, spatharios, protospatharios, protosebastos and protoproedros were granted by the emperor to the recipient for life but were not inherent in the office (  , axia dia brabeiou), but the title doux belonged to the office (  , axia dia logou). Thus, into the eleventh century the Venetian doges held titles typical of Byzantine rulers in outlying regions, such as Sardinia. As late as 1202, the Doge Enrico Dandolo was styled protosebastos, a title granted by Alexios III.As Byzantine power declined in the region in the late ninth century, reference to Venice as a province disappeared in the titulature of the doges. The simple titles dux Veneticorum (duke of the Venetians) and dux Venetiarum (duke of the Venetias) predominate in the tenth century. The plural reflects the doge's rule of several federated townships and clans.    After defeating Croatia and conquering some Dalmatian territory in 1000, Doge Pietro II Orseolo adopted the title dux Dalmatiae, Duke of Dalmatia, or in its fuller form, Veneticorum atque Dalmaticorum dux, Duke of the Venetians and Dalmatians. This title was recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II in 1002. After a Venetian request, it was confirmed by the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos in 1082. In a chrysobull dated that year, Alexios granted the Venetian doge the imperial title of protosebastos and recognised him as imperial doux over the Dalmatian theme.The expression Dei gratia (by the grace of God) was adopted consistently by the Venetian chancery only in the course of the eleventh century. An early example, however, can be found in 827–29, during the joint reign of Justinian and his brother John I: per divinam gratiam Veneticorum provinciae duces, by divine grace dukes of the Venetian provinces.Between 1091 and 1102, the King of Hungary acquired the Croatian kingdom and the two kingdoms entered a personal union. In these circumstances, the Venetians appealed to the Byzantine emperor for recognition of their title to Croatia (like Dalmatia a former Byzantine subject). Perhaps as early as the reign of Vital Falier (d. 1095), certainly by that of Vital Michiel (d. 1102), the title dux Croatiae had been added, giving the full dogal title four parts: dux Venetiae atque Dalmatiae sive Chroaciae et imperialis prothosevastos, Duke of Venice, Dalmatia and Croatia and Imperial Protosebastos. In the fourteenth century, the doges periodically objected to the use of Dalmatia and Croatia in the Hungarian king's titulature, regardless of their own territorial rights or claims. Later medieval chronicles mistakenly attributed the acquisition of the Croatian title to Doge Ordelaf Falier (d. 1117).According to the Venetiarum Historia, written around 1350, Doge Domenico Morosini added atque Ystrie dominator (""and lord of Istria"") to his title after forcing Pula on Istria to submit in 1150. Only one charter, however, actually uses a title similar to this: et totius Ystrie inclito dominatori (1153).    The next major change in the dogal title came with the Fourth Crusade, which conquered the Byzantine Empire (1204). The Byzantine honorific protosebastos had by this time been dropped and was replaced by a reference to Venice's allotment in the partitioning of the Byzantine Empire. The new full title was ""By the grace of God glorious duke of the Venices, Dalmatia and Croatia and lord of a fourth part and a half [three eighths] of the whole Empire of Romania"" (Dei gratia gloriosus Venetiarum, Dalmatiae atque Chroatiae dux, ac dominus [or dominator] quartae partis et dimidie totius imperii Romaniae). The Greek chronicler George Akropolites uses the term despotes to translate dominus, lord. Akropolites attributes the title to Enrico Dandolo, although no known document of his survives with this title. The earliest documents using the title attach it to Marino Zeno, leader of the Venetians in Constantinople. The title was only subsequently adopted by Doge Pietro Ziani in 1205.By the Treaty of Zadar of 1358, Venice renounced its claims to Dalmatia and removed Dalmatia and Croatia from the doge's title. The resulting title was Dei gratia dux Veneciarum et cetera, By the grace of God duke of Venetia and the rest. This was the title used in official documents until the end of the republic. Even when the body of such documents was written in Italian, the title and dating clause were in Latin.     The doge's prerogatives were not defined with precision. While the position was entrusted to members of the inner circle of powerful Venetian families, after several doges had associated a son with themselves in the ducal office, this tendency toward a hereditary monarchy was checked by a law that decreed that no doge had the right to associate any member of his family with himself in his office, nor to name his successor. After 1172 the election of the doge was entrusted to a committee of forty, who were chosen by four men selected from the Great Council of Venice, which was itself nominated annually by twelve persons. After a deadlocked tie at the election of 1229, the number of electors was increased from forty to forty-one.New regulations for the elections of the doge introduced in 1268 remained in force until the end of the republic in 1797. Their intention was to minimize the influence of individual great families, and this was effected by a complex electoral machinery. Thirty members of the Great Council, chosen by lot, were reduced by lot to nine; the nine chose forty and the forty were reduced by lot to twelve, who chose twenty-five. The twenty-five were reduced by lot to nine, and the nine elected forty-five. These forty-five were once more reduced by lot to eleven, and the eleven finally chose the forty-one who elected the doge. Election required at least twenty-five votes out of forty-one, nine votes out of eleven or twelve, or seven votes out of nine electors..Before taking the oath of investiture, the doge-elect was presented to the concio with the words: ""This is your doge, if it please you."" This ceremonial gesture signified the assent of the Venetian people. This practice came to an end with the abolition of the concio in 1423; after the election of Francesco Foscari, he was  presented with the unconditional pronouncement - ""Your doge"".     While doges had great temporal power at first, after 1268, the doge was constantly under strict surveillance: he had to wait for other officials to be present before opening dispatches from foreign powers; he was not allowed to possess any property in a foreign land.The doges normally ruled for life (although a few were forcibly removed from office).  After a doge's death, a commission of inquisitori passed judgment upon his acts, and his estate was liable to be fined for any discovered malfeasance. The official income of the doge was never large, and from early times holders of the office remained engaged in trading ventures. These ventures kept them in touch with the requirements of the grandi. From 7 July 1268, during a vacancy in the office of doge, the state was headed ex officio, with the style vicedoge, by the senior consigliere ducale (ducal counsellor).     One of the ceremonial duties of the doge was to celebrate the symbolic marriage of Venice with the sea. This was done by casting a ring from the state barge, the Bucentaur, into the Adriatic. In its earlier form this ceremony was instituted to commemorate the conquest of Dalmatia by Doge Pietro II Orseolo in 1000, and was celebrated on Ascension Day. It took its later and more magnificent form after the visit to Venice in 1177 of Pope Alexander III and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I. On state occasions the Doge was surrounded by an increasing amount of ceremony, and in international relations he had the status of a sovereign prince.The doge took part in ducal processions, which started in the Piazza San Marco. The doge would appear in the center of the procession, preceded by civil servants ranked in ascending order of prestige and followed by noble magistrates ranked in descending order of status. Francesco Sansovino described such a procession in minute detail in 1581. His description is confirmed and complemented by Cesare Vecellio's 1586 painting of a ducal procession in the Piazza San Marco.     From the 14th century onward, the ceremonial crown and well-known symbol of the doge of Venice was called corno ducale, a unique ducal hat. It was a stiff horn-like bonnet, which was made of gemmed brocade or cloth-of-gold and worn over the camauro. This was a fine linen cap with a structured peak reminiscent of the Phrygian cap, a classical symbol of liberty. This ceremonial cap may have been ultimately based on the white crown of Upper Egypt. Every Easter Monday the doge headed a procession from San Marco to the convent of San Zaccaria, where the abbess presented him a new camauro crafted by the nuns. The Doge's official costume also included golden robes, slippers and a sceptre for ceremonial duties.    Until the 15th century, the funeral service for a deceased doge would normally be held at St Mark's Basilica, where some early holders of this office are also buried. After the 15th century, however, the funerals of all later doges were held at the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo. Twenty-five doges are buried there.    As the oligarchical element in the constitution developed, the more important functions of the ducal office were assigned to other officials, or to administrative boards. The doge's role became a mostly representative position. The last doge was Ludovico Manin, who abdicated in 1797, when Venice passed under the power of Napoleon's France following his conquest of the city.While Venice would shortly declare itself again as a republic, attempting to resist annexation by Austria, it would never revive the dogal style. It used various titles, including dictator, and collective heads of state to govern the jurisdiction, including a triumvirate.       Doge of Genoa Senarica Signoria of Venice Sortition   "
"Dogaressa ( DOH-gə-ress-ə, DOH-jə-, Italian: [doɡaˈressa], Venetian: [doɡaˈɾesa]) was the official title of the spouse of the Doge of Venice. [SEP]    The position of the dogaressa was regulated by the laws of the Republic, which specified which duties and rights she had, and what was prohibited for the title holder. These rights changed several times during the history of the Republic. The first bearer of the title was reportedly Dogaressa Carola in the 800s, and the last was Elisabetta Grimani in the 1790s.    Just like the Doge, the dogaressa was crowned, made a Solemn Entry, and gave a vow of loyalty (promissione ducale) to the republic upon her coronation. The symbols of her rank were a golden veil and a crown in a similar shape as that of the doge. Similar to a queen, the dogaressa was provided with a household of ladies-in-waiting. The coronation of the dogaressa was abolished during certain periods, as specified below. Formally, the dogaressa had no political rights whatsoever, and her task was to participate in the representational life of the republic and official ceremonies and rituals designed to personify the glory of the state, and had as such a very visible public role. She was expected to act as the formal protector of certain guilds and trades, and could as such play in important part in the role of this trades within the state, something several dogaressas are known to have done. Alicia Giustiniani, for example, played an important part in Venetian commerce and business because of this role. Though law refused any influence over state affairs to the dogaressa, some wielded a great deal of influence over the affairs of state in practice, most notably Felicia Cornaro. When the dogaressa became a widow, she was socially expected to become a nun. However, there was no actual law to require this, and some widowed dogaressas refused to follow this custom, though it was considered scandalous.    During the centuries, the regulations around the dogaressa introduced laws to restrict her rights: in the 13th-century, the dogaressa was banned from receiving dignitaries and make public donations on her own, and in 1342, a law banned her from conducting business affairs of her own. The coronation ceremony of the dogaressa did not occur between that of Taddea Michiel in 1478 and Zilia Dandolo in 1556; after the coronation of Morosina Morosini in 1597, the coronation of a dogaressa was deemed unnecessary in 1645 and the other ceremonies around her suppressed to a minimum. The last dogaressa to be crowned was Elisabetta Querini in 1694, after which the ceremony was permanently abolished. After the tenure of Elisabetta Querini, most other ceremonial privileges of the dogaressa was abolished as well: in 1700, she was no longer permitted to wear a crown and receive gifts from dignitaries. In 1763, the Solemn Entry was revived by the wish of the Doge for Pisana Conaro, who was the last dogaressa to perform it.    804-811: Carola, wife of Obelerio degli Antenori 811-827: Elena 827-830: Felicita 888-912: Angela Sanudo 942–959: Arcielda Candiano 959–966: Giovanniccia Candiano 966–976: Waldrada of Tuscany 976–978: Felicia Malipiero 979-991: Marina Candiano 991-1009: Maria Candiano 1009–1026: a sister of Stephen I of Hungary 1075–1083: Theodora Doukaina Selvo 1084-1096: Cornella Bembo 1096–1102: Felicia Cornaro 1102–1116: Matelda Faliero 1116–1130: Alicia Michele 1148-1156: Sofia 1156–1172: Felicita Maria di Boemondo 1172-1178: Cecilia 1192-1205: unknown 1205–1229: Constance of Sicily, Dogaressa of Venice 1229–1240: Maria Storlato 1242–1249: Valdrada of Sicily 1252-1268: Loicia da Prata 1268-1275: Marchesina Ghisi 1275-1280: Jacobina 1280-1289: Caterina 1289-1310: Tommasina Morosini 1310-1312: Agnese 1312-1329: Franchesina 1329-1339: Elisabetta 1339-1342: Giustina Cappello 1342-1354: Isabella de Fieschi 1354–1355: Aluycia Gradenigo 1355-1356: Marina Cappello 1361-1365: Maria Giustinian 1365-1367: Caterina Corner 1382-1382: Cristina Condulmiero 1382-1400: Agnese 1400–1413: Marina Galina 1423–1457: Marina Nani 1457–1462: Giovanna Dandolo 1462–1471: Cristina Sanudo 1471-1472: Aliodea Morosini 1473-1474: Contarina Contarini Morosini 1474-1476: Laura Zorzi 1476-1478: Regina Gradenico 1478-1485: Taddea Michiel 1485-1486: Lucia Ruzzini 1486-1501: Elisabetta Soranzo 1501-1521: Giustina Guistiniani 1521-1523: Caterina Loredan 1523-1538: Benedetta Vendramin 1538-1545: Maria Pasqualigo 1545–1553: Alicia Giustiniani 1556–1559: Zilia Dandolo 1559-1567: Elena Diedo 1567-1570: Maria Cappello 1570–1577: Loredana Marcello 1577-1578: Cecilia Contarini 1578-1585: Arcangela Canali 1585-1595: Laura Morosini 1595–1606: Morosina Morosini 1618-1623: Elena Barbarigo 1625-1629: Chiara Delfino 1655-1656: Paolina Loredano 1656-1656: Andreana Priuli 1656-1658: Elisabetta Pisano 1658-1659: Lucia Barbarigo 1694–1700: Elisabetta Querini 1709-1722: Laura Cornaro 1735-1741: Elena Badoero 1763–1769: Pisana Conaro 1771–1779: Polissena Contarini Da Mula 1779–1789: Margherita Dalmet 1789–1792: Elisabetta Grimani   "
"Paolo Lucio Anafesto (Latin: Paulucius Anafestus) was, according to tradition, the first Doge of Venice, serving from 697 to 717. [SEP]    A noble of Eraclea, then the primary city of the region, he was elected in 697 as an official over the entire lagoon that surrounded Venice.  His job was to both put an end to the conflicts between the various tribunes who until then had governed the differing parts and to coordinate the defense against the Lombards and the Slavs who were encroaching on their settlements. However, Anafesto's existence is uncorroborated by any source before the 11th century.    According to John Julius Norwich, Paolo Lucio Anafesto was actually Exarch Paul.  Moreover, Paul's magister militum had the same first name as Paoluccio's reputed successor, Marcellus Tegallianus, casting doubt on the authenticity of that doge as well.   "
"Jovian, surnamed Hypatus or Ceparius (Italian: Gioviano Ceparico Ipato), was Byzantine magister militum per Venetiae in charge of the duchy of Venice in 740. [SEP] Following the murder of the doge Orso Ipato in 737, the Exarch of Ravenna imposed administration by annual magistri militum on Venice who replaced the doge. Jovian was the fourth of these officials. This period of government by magistri militum lasted until 742, when the fifth and last of such officials was deposed and the dogeship was restored. Not much is known about Jovian. John the Deacon, who wrote the Chronicon Venetum et Gradense, in the early 11th century, said that he ruled wisely. He called him the ipato named Jovianus. This indicates that he had the title of hypatos. This was a Byzantine honorary title which roughly meant first among the consuls. During his government there was a violent clash between the town of Heraclia and neighbour and rival Equilium.   "
"Felice Cornicola (Latin: Felix Cornicula), also Felicius, was a Byzantine magister militum per Venetiae of Venice in 739.

Cornicola was the second magister militum. Its first incumbent was Domenico Leoni. Cornicola was succeeded by Teodato Ipato. This period of government by magistri militum lasted until 742, when the fifth and last of such officials was deposed and the dogeship was restored. Originally a citizen of Malamocco, he was described as being a mild and unassuming man whose tenure as magister militum was marked by justness and moderation. He is said to have become so popular with his subjects that he was able to freely and without challenge rescind the sentence of exile against Teodato Ipato, which had been issued soon after the assassination of his father Orso Ipato. Once his twelve-month term had reached its end, Felicius was succeeded as magister militum by Teodato himself, he having gained the favour of the electors since being recalled from exile.   "

"Maurizio Galbaio (Latin: Mauricius Galba) (died 787) was the seventh traditional, but fifth historical, Doge of Venice from 764 to his death. [SEP] He was the first great doge, who reigned for 22 years and set Venice on its path to independence and success.    Maurizio was raised to the dogeship at a time when two tribunes were being elected annually to check the power of the doge. His predecessor had been from a pro-Lombard faction, but Maurizio was a wealthy man from pro-Byzantine Heraclea. He opposed both the strong republican faction, which supported moving towards de facto independence, and the pro-Frankish and pro-Lombard factions. He received the titles of magister militum and hypatos from the Emperor Leo IV.The Lombard king Desiderius, in light of the alliance between the papacy and the Frankish king Charlemagne and the strong clerical support for Frankish hegemony in Venice, ravaged the states of the church and Istria, even capturing the doge's son Giovanni. Through the pope, Maurizio sent ambassadors to Charlemagne and his son was released. Maurizio then made the first of many subsequent attempts to create a hereditary dogeship when, in 778, he had his son made a second doge. Maurizio obtained the consent of the emperor of the East for this last act.  During Maurizio's final eleven years, the Venetians expanded permanently to the Rialto islands. On the little island of Olivolo (now Castello), he reconsecrated the church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus as that of St Peter. It was raised to episcopal status and was the cathedral of Venice throughout the republican era. The low point of Maurizio's reign was the expulsion from the Pentapolis of Venetian traders for trading in slaves and eunuchs.  Maurizio was succeeded by his son on his death. His name, Galbaio, came from his reputed descent from the ancient Roman emperor Galba.   "

Galla was probably pro-Frankish. He barely survived on the throne for a year before he was deposed, blinded, and exiled as Teodato had been. He is regarded as the traditional founder of the Barozzi family.   "
"Orso Ipato (Latin: Ursus Hypatus; died 737) was the third traditional Doge of Venice (726–737) and the first historically known. [SEP] During his eleven-year reign, he brought great change to the Venetian navy, aided in the recapture of Ravenna from Lombard invaders, and cultivated harmonious relations with the Byzantine Empire. He was murdered in 737 during a civil conflict.    Perhaps a native of Eraclea, Orso was elected Doge in 726 following the death of Marcello Tegalliano. The Venetian people had elected him against the will of the Byzantine Empire, a consequence of the Byzantines' unwelcome attempts to institute iconoclasm in the West. Virtually nothing is known of his life before his accession, though it is reasonable to assume that he was born in the latter part of the seventh century. Described by one historian as being a 'warlike man', his reign saw much innovation in the way of martial and naval matters. He focused especially on strengthening the navy against the Lombards and other like-minded invaders active at the time. Additionally he strove to highlight the importance of military exercises, and to this end established schools in Eraclea where the town's youth were coached in bow and crossbow shooting.Of note was Orso's involvement in the recovery of Ravenna following its capture by the Lombard king Liutprand. It is said that, at the request of Exarch Eutychius, Orso sent a fleet of eighty ships to the fore, successfully relieving the city of Lombard control. This feat served to ease relations with the Byzantine Empire, and while Venice by no means accepted its supremacy, the two co-existed in relative concord. For his efforts Orso was awarded the prestigious title hypatos by Emperor Leo the Isaurian. The surname Ipato is thought to be derived from this imperial honorific. His reign came to an end in 737 in the midst of mounting conflict between Eraclea and Equilio, described by some as being a full-blown civil war. It is said that the Doge, rather than attempt to calm the situation, sided with the Eracleans and partook in the war – leading a number of his disgruntled subjects to take matters into their own hands and violently kill him. In the years following his death there was an interregnum filled by five magistri militum, the first of these being Domenico Leoni. The office of doge was later restored with the election of Orso's son, Teodato, in 742.   "

[SEP] With his election came the restoration of the dogato, which had been defunct since the assassination of his father, Orso Ipato. Before his election he had served as magister militum in 739. Teodato was the son of Doge Orso Ipato. He was condemned to exile in 737 in the wake of his father's murder, which came perhaps as a complication of a civil conflict between Eraclea and Equilio. The office of doge was subsequently abolished in favour of a magister militum, denoting in this case a chief magistrate to be replaced yearly. The first to be installed in this role was Domenico Leoni, who at the end of his twelve-month term was replaced by Felicius Cornicola. It was under Felicius' administration that Teodato was recalled from exile.After returning home, Teodato is said to have gained the favour of the Venetian electors, and in 739, he was thus selected as Felicius Cornicola's successor. At the end of his term he was himself replaced by Jovian Ceparius, having failed to procure re-election; and Jovian, at his term's end, was succeeded by Giovanni Fabriciaco, who took office in 741. Fabriciaco's appointment would prove disastrous: some months into his term an uprising took hold, and consequently he was ousted from office, blinded, and driven into exile. Most historians put this at around 742. Teodato, said to have been complicit in Fabriciaco's downfall, was later by popular vote appointed Doge, marking the end of the interregnum which had lasted from 737–42. Under Teodato, Venice's seat of government was moved from Eraclea to Malamocco. Also during his reign came the renewal of an age-old treaty with the Lombards, first composed in the reign of Paolo Lucio Anafesto, and an earthquake which is said to have flooded parts of Venice. His reign came to an end in 755 when he was deposed and blinded at the instigation of Galla Gaulo, who was subsequently elected Doge. An alternative view of Teodato's fate, as described in Hazlitt's History of the Venetian Republic, is that rather than being blinded and deposed, he was instead murdered by adherents of Galla Gaulo.   "
"Domenico Leoni (Latin: Dominicus Leo Abrogatis; life dates unknown) was a Byzantine magister militum per Venetiae in charge of Venice in 738. [SEP] Following the murder of the doge Orso Ipato in 737, the Exarch of Ravenna imposed administration by annual magistri militum on Venice. Domenico was the first of these officials. He was succeeded by Felice Cornicola. This period of government by magistri militum lasted until 742, when the fifth and last of such officials was deposed and the dogeship was restored.   "
"Domenico Monegario was the traditional sixth Doge of Venice (756–764).    He was elected with the support of the Lombard king Desiderius. [SEP] However, in order to maintain necessary good relations with Byzantium and the Franks, two tribunes were elected annually to limit ducal power. Domenico came to resent these checks and was removed after eight years.  During his reign, the transformation of the Venetians from fishermen to marine traders happened, with audacious travels as far as the Ionian Islands and the Levant. The art of shipbuilding was improved to make sturdier, faster ships. Venetian wealth increased via trade and the city took on the medieval character it held for the next millennium. When Pope Paul I demanded donations from Venice to the Holy See, the Doge Monegario was deposed, blinded, and exiled as his two predecessors had been. The surname Monegario may derive from monegarium, that is, a friar or monk, or monetarium, that is, a minter.   "
"Marcello Tegalliano (Latin: Marcellus Tegalianus; died 726) was, according to tradition, the second Doge of Venice (717–726). He is described as having hailed from Eraclea, and during his nine-year reign was apparently in great disagreement with the nearby Longobards. [SEP] He died in 726 and was succeeded by Orso Ipato.     However, John Julius Norwich has argued that the first doge, Paoluccio Anafesto, was Paul, Exarch of Ravenna, and that Marcellus was his magister militum of the same first name.   "
"Solomon ben Nathan Ashkenazi (ca. 1520-1602) was a Jewish physician and businessman active in Ottoman politics during the late 16th century. [SEP]  Ashkenazi wielded considerable influence, most famously helping bring about the Jews’ readmission to Venice in 1573.    Ashkenazi was born in Udine to Jewish parents of German origin.  He studied medicine at the University of Padua   and trained as a rabbi...  Following the expulsion of the Jews from Udine in 1556, Ashkenazi traveled to Cracow, Poland to serve as chief physician to King Sigismund II Augustus.  In 1564 Ashkenazi left for a post as court physician in Istanbul.    In Istanbul Ashkenazi rose to prominence, befriending the Venetian Bailo Marcantonio Barbaro and the Ottoman Grand Vizier Mehmed Sokollu.  He and his brother also became involved in the wine trade between Crete and Poland, centered in Istanbul, as did many Jews of the time.  The outbreak of the Ottoman-Venetian War in 1570 turned Ashkenazi into a key intermediary party between Turkey and Venice.  Ashkenazi held two posts during the war: royal physician to Sokollu’s wife and official physician to the Venetian community in Istanbul.  He carried out secret orders from the Grand Vizier intended to bring about peace, preventing arrests of military leaders and carrying messages between the two sides.  Together with the Grand Dragoman Ali Bey, Ashkenazi drafted the peace treaty that ended the war in 1573.Ashkenazi was instrumental in choosing a successor for the Polish King Sigismund II Augustus, who left no heir upon his death in 1572.  Polish law required an election be held.  The candidates included the Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible; the German emperor Maximilian II; the Pope’s nominee, a minor Catholic prince; and the French prince, Henri of Anjou.  The entire Europe balance of power was in limbo.  Despite ostensibly belonging to the Polish gentry, the choice of the next Polish king effectively rested in the hands of the Ottoman Porte, whose sphere of influence extended into Poland.  A French ambassador traveled to Istanbul to win the endorsement of Turkish leaders.  He met with Ashkenazi, convincing him a French king of Poland was necessary to maintain the balance of power; in turn, Ashkenazi persuaded the Grand Vizier to back Henri.  After Henri ascended the Polish throne, Ashkenazi sent the king his congratulations, writing, “I have rendered your majesty most important service in securing your election: I have effected all that was done here.”    In 1572, the Venetian Doge, Alvise I Mocenigo, called for the re-enforcement of the 1556 decree of expulsion, inciting many Jews to leave and igniting a contentious debate in the Senate.  The Jews’ involvement in foreign trade and pawn-broking made them vital economic assets to the Venetian city-state.  Moreover, some Venetian citizens objected morally to the replacement of Jewish banks with the Christian Monte di Pietà, an up-and-coming institution in Venetian towns.  At the same time, others argued that Jewish expulsion was a matter of moral necessity, citing the banishment of Jews from Spain and Portugal.Back in Istanbul, Ashkenazi used his contacts to exert political pressure on the Venetian authorities on the issue of Jewish expulsion.  Through an arrangement with Jacopo Soranzo, a Venetian official in Istanbul, Ashkenazi had arranged for some expelled Venetian Jews to come to Turkey.  Soranzo returned to Venice shortly afterward to warn the Senate of the threat inherent in that arrangement.  The Jews living presently in Turkey, he explained, who had been expelled earlier from Spain and Portugal, now manufactured weapons for the Ottoman forces to use against Venice.  To add onto them Jews expelled from Venice could be costly or even dangerous.  Ashkenazi made similar arguments to Barbaro, who relayed them to the Doge in his dispatches on the Ottoman situationThese factors doubtless contributed to the Senate’s decision to readmit the Jews in December 1573.  But it would be fallacious to attribute full credit to Ashkenazi.  Another proposal presented to the Venetian Senate earlier that year suggested the Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal be permitted entry, provided they lived in ghettos.  While that proposal did not pass, it served to remind the Senate of the economic importance of the Jews and likely contributed to their ultimate readmission    Following the Polish election, the Porte named Ashkenazi envoy to Venice.  Controversy flamed on both sides about the appointment of a Jew.  In Turkey, Sokollu vouched for the doctor’s political acumen, while in Venice Barbaro sung Ashkenazi’s praises.  After some debate, Ashkenazi won the seat and travelled to Venice in May 1574.The Venetian authorities and Jewish community showered Ashkenazi with gifts upon his arrival.  As Ottoman ambassador, his track record proved mixed. Ashkenazi successfully negotiated a dispute over the borders of Dalmatia, but failed in his advocacy for the formation of a Venetian-Ottoman military alliance.  While in Venice he also helped a group of Jewish merchants petition for compensation for the property they lost after leaving Venice because of the banishment decree.  The petition succeeded and the merchants were compensated; many nonetheless chose not to return to Venice    Ashkenazi returned to Istanbul in July 1574, remaining active in politics until Sokollu’s death in 1579.  He managed his financial affairs poorly and died in poverty in 1602   "
"The Merchant of Venice is a 16th-century play written by William Shakespeare in which a merchant in Venice named Antonio defaults on a large loan provided by a Jewish moneylender, Shylock. [SEP] It is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1599. Although classified as a comedy in the First Folio and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic comedies, the play is most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and it is best known for Shylock and his famous ""Hath not a Jew eyes?"" speech on humanity. Also notable is Portia's speech about ""the quality of mercy"".        Bassanio, a young Venetian of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress Portia of Belmont. Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 ducats to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend Antonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice, who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor – his ships and merchandise are busy at sea to Tripolis, the Indies, Mexico and England – he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor. Antonio has already antagonized Shylock through his outspoken antisemitism and because Antonio's habit of lending money without interest forces Shylock to charge lower rates. Shylock is at first reluctant to grant the loan, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. He finally agrees to lend the sum to Bassanio without interest upon one condition: if Antonio were unable to repay it at the specified date, Shylock may take a pound of Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition; Antonio is surprised by what he sees as the moneylender's generosity (no ""usance"" – interest – is asked for), and he signs the contract. With money in hand, Bassanio leaves for Belmont with his friend Gratiano, who has asked to accompany him. Gratiano is a likeable young man, but he is often flippant, overly talkative, and tactless. Bassanio warns his companion to exercise self-control, and the two leave for Belmont. Meanwhile, in Belmont, Portia is awash with suitors. Her father left a will stipulating that each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets, made of gold, silver and lead respectively. Whoever picks the right casket wins Portia's hand. The first suitor, the Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, ""Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire"", as referring to Portia. The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Aragon, chooses the silver casket, which proclaims, ""Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves"", as he believes he is full of merit. Both suitors leave empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, ""Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath"". The last suitor is Bassanio, whom Portia wishes to succeed, having met him before. As Bassanio ponders his choice, members of Portia's household sing a song that says that ""fancy"" (not true love) is ""engend'red in the eyes, / With gazing fed""; Bassanio chooses the lead casket and wins Portia's hand.  At Venice, Antonio's ships are reported lost at sea, so the merchant cannot repay the bond. Shylock has become more determined to exact revenge from Christians because his daughter Jessica eloped with the Christian Lorenzo and converted. She took a substantial amount of Shylock's wealth with her, as well as a turquoise ring which Shylock had been given by his late wife, Leah. Shylock has Antonio brought before court. At Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to repay the loan from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratiano leave for Venice, with money from Portia, to save Antonio's life by offering the money to Shylock. Unknown to Bassanio and Gratiano, Portia sent her servant, Balthazar, to seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, at Padua. The climax of the play is set in the court of the Duke of Venice. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor. He identifies himself as Balthazar, a young male ""doctor of the law"", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is Portia in disguise, and the law clerk who accompanies her is Nerissa, also disguised as a man. As Balthazar, Portia in a famous speech repeatedly asks Shylock to show mercy, advising him that mercy ""is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes"" (Act IV, Sc 1, Line 185). However, Shylock adamantly refuses any compensations and insists on the pound of flesh. As the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia deftly appropriates Shylock's argument for ""specific performance"". She says that the contract allows Shylock to remove only the flesh, not the blood, of Antonio (see quibble). Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his ""lands and goods"" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. She tells him that he must cut precisely one pound of flesh, no more, no less; she advises him that ""if the scale do turn, But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate."" Defeated, Shylock consents to accept Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond: first his offer to pay ""the bond thrice"", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then merely the principal; but Portia also prevents him from doing this, on the ground that he has already refused it ""in the open court"". She cites a law under which Shylock, as a Jew and therefore an ""alien"", having attempted to take the life of a citizen, has forfeited his property, half to the government and half to Antonio, leaving his life at the mercy of the Duke.  The Duke spares Shylock's life and says he may remit the forfeiture. Portia says the Duke may waive the state's share, but not Antonio's. Antonio says he is content that the state waive its claim to half Shylock's wealth if he can have his one-half share ""in use"" until Shylock's death, when the principal would be given to Lorenzo and Jessica. Antonio also asks that ""for this favor"" Shylock convert to Christianity and bequeath his entire estate to Lorenzo and Jessica. The Duke then threatens to recant his pardon of Shylock's life unless he accepts these conditions. Shylock, re-threatened with death, accepts with the words, ""I am content."" (IV, i). Bassanio does not recognise his disguised wife, but offers to give a present to the supposed lawyer. First she declines, but after he insists, Portia requests his ring and Antonio's gloves. Antonio parts with his gloves without a second thought, but Bassanio gives the ring only after much persuasion from Antonio, as earlier in the play he promised his wife never to lose, sell or give it. Nerissa, as the lawyer's clerk, succeeds in likewise retrieving her ring from Gratiano, who does not see through her disguise. At Belmont, Portia and Nerissa taunt and pretend to accuse their husbands before revealing they were really the lawyer and his clerk in disguise (V). After all the other characters make amends, Antonio learns from Portia that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all.   "
"The Spanish Synagogue is one of the two functioning synagogues in the Venetian Ghetto of Venice, northern Italy. [SEP] It is open for services from Passover until the end of the High Holiday season. The Spanish Synagogue was founded by Jews expelled from the Iberian peninsula in the 1490s who reached Venice, usually via Amsterdam, Livorno or Ferrara, in the 1550s. The four-story yellow stone building was constructed in 1580 and was restored in 1635. It is a clandestine synagogue, which was tolerated on the condition that it be concealed within a building that gives no appearance being a house of worship form the exterior, although the interior is elaborately decorated.

"""The quality of mercy"" is a monologue by Portia in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice; it occurs during Act 4, Scene 1, set in a Venetian Court of Justice. [SEP] It is the speech in which Portia begs Shylock for mercy. The speech is regarded as one of the great speeches in Shakespeare, and it is an example of the esteem Shakespeare held for those who showed mercy.       The speech is regarded as one of the great speeches in Shakespeare and is made by Portia, disguised as young lawyer Balthazar, who speaks with heightened eloquence to beg Shylock for mercy after traveling from the fictional town of Belmont to Venice.Mercy and forgiveness are enduring themes that pervade Shakespeare's works. The quote is an example of the esteem Shakespeare held for those who showed mercy as expressed in his poetry. Shakespeare presented mercy as a quality most valuable to the most powerful, strongest and highest people in society.Harold Fisch, formerly of Bar-Ilan University, argued that the words of Deuteronomy 32:2, “My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew; as the small rain upon the tender grass, and as the showers upon the herb,” were echoed in the first words of the speech, “The quality of mercy is not strained. / It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven / Upon the place beneath.”   "
"Francesco Basilicata (died c. 1640) was a 17th-century Italian cartographer and military engineer. [SEP] Basilicata worked in the service of the Republic of Venice and is known for his maps and drawings of the island of Crete.    Very little is known about Basilicata's life. Gerola has suggested that he might have been from Palermo. Other sources tell us that he was from Campania who came to Basilicata for work. When he returned home he would have taken the surname Basilicata. However, it is certain that Basilicata lived on Crete for several years during the first decades of the 17th century, near the end of Venetian presence on the island.     Basilicata probably arrived on Crete around 1609, at a time that the island was an overseas colony of the Republic of Venice known as the Kingdom of Candia after its capital, Candia or Chandax (modern Heraklion). During the course of several years and based on his first hand experience, Basilicata produced three different sets of drawings and maps (dated 1612, 1618–19 and 1629–30). His Atlas, composed around 1618 and today preserved in Museo Correr, is his most famous work. Basilicata makes skillful use of color to highlight the topography of each region. He meticulously draws every important detail in an aesthetically pleasing manner and often uses vantage points which are unusual and original for the time. In addition to maps, Basilicata also produced several manuscripts concerned mainly with the state of the fortifications of Crete, but also its geography, history, archaeology, administration and economy. It has been suggested that Basilicata's 1612 map was copied by Marco Boschini, whose 1651 map entitled The Entire Kingdom of Candia strongly influenced the cartography of Crete in Italy and abroad. However, other authors do not accept this claim and, despite not denying Basilicata's influence on Boschini's map, consider the latter to be the result of collective work by several engineers.   "
"Đorđe Nemanjić or George of Zeta (Serbian Cyrillic:  ; fl. 1208–1243) was the Grand Prince of Zeta, from at least 1208 until at least 1243. For some time, he also was a self-styled King of Duklja. He was the son of rival Serbian Grand Prince and titular King Vukan Nemanjić (r. Serbia 1202–1204, Duklja (Zeta) 1190–1208), hence George too was a titular King, for a few years after his father's death. [SEP] He continued the struggle between his father and uncle, and accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice.     Stefan Nemanja had managed to secure the independence from the Byzantine Empire after the death of emperor Manuel I (1180), and then conquered the traditional fiefs of Duklja, Travunia and Hum on the Adriatic coast. Nemanja gives Vukan, as heir presumptive, appanages of the conquered lands, including Hvosno and Toplica around 1190 as Grand Prince.Although Vukan was the eldest son of Stefan Nemanja, Nemanja had instead chosen his younger son Stefan [II] as heir. This was done as Nemanja preferred to see Stefan Nemanjić on the Serbian throne as he was married to Eudokia, the daughter of Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos. It seems that Vukan reacted on this change in succession by adopting a royal title; in an inscription dated 1195 in the church of St. Luke in Kotor, Vukan is titled as King of Duklja, Dalmatia, Travunia, Toplica and Hvosno. Although Vukan assumed a royal title, he remained under his father's authority. In 1196, at a State Council, Nemanja abdicated in favour of Stefan; Vukan had to recognize his brother as the new ruler of Serbia. Nemanja took monastic vows and was given the name Simeon, and retreated to Hilandar at Mount Athos. While Nemanja was alive Vukan didn't oppose Stefan's rule but as soon as Nemanja died in 1200 he started to plot against Stefan in order to become Grand Prince. He found aid in Hungarian King Emeric (1196–1204) who at the time fought against the Second Bulgarian Empire and wanted Serbian assistance. With the help of Hungarian troops in 1202, Vukan managed to overthrow Stefan, who fled to Bulgaria, and Vukan was left to rule. In an inscription dating to 1202–1203, Vukan is titled as Grand Župan Vukan, Ruler of all Serbian land, Zeta, maritime towns and land of Nišava.In return for Hungarian help, Vukan became a Hungarian vassal and promised that he would convert to Catholicism if the Pope would give him royal title. However, as a Hungarian vassal, Vukan soon got involved in the Hungarian conflict with Bulgaria. In 1203 Bulgarians attacked Serbia and conquered the eastern part of country with the city of Niš. In the chaos that followed the Bulgarian attack, and using Vukan's talks with the pope against him, Stefan managed to return to Serbia and overthrow Vukan in 1204, becoming Grand Prince again.        George was the eldest son of Vukan Nemanjić. He had three brothers: Stefan, who founded Morača monastery in 1252, Dmitar (better known by his monastic name David) who founded the Davidovica monastery and was still alive in 1286, and Mladen (Bladinus).After Vukan's coup, Stefan managed to return to Serbia and overthrow him in 1204, regaining the rule of Serbia as Grand Prince. On intervention of the third brother, archbishop Sava, Stefan spared Vukan and returned him his appanage in Zeta. Vukan abdicated for his son George, who is mentioned as ""King"" in 1208. Vukan is mentioned as ""Great Prince"" in an inscription in Studenica, dated 1209. Possibly Vukan abdicated in favour for George in his lifetime in order to secure his succession; Stefan might have had taken Zeta during an interregnum. Vukan seems to have died in 1209 or shortly thereafter.    The struggle between the two Nemanjić branches continued under George. George accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice, probably in 1208. He could have at least two motives for his entering this arrangement: not only could the Venetian alliance help prevent Stefan from obtaining control of his lands, but it also would Venice from asserting full control over his ports in southern Dalmatia. (After the Fourth Crusade Venice had been working to obtain control over Balkan ports, and had in 1205 established an arrangement with Dubrovnik under which the city was required to support Venice militarily in exchange for retaining its autonomy in other respects.) George soon also entered a military alliance with Venice against the Albanian Dimitri of the Progon family, who controlled a part of Albania from a mountain stronghold at Kroja (Arbanon). Dimitri was theoretically also a vassal of Venice, but in a treaty signed on 3 July 1208, George promised to provide military support to Venice if Dimitri attacked Venetian territory. The Gëziq inscription mention the Progon family as judices, and notes their dependence to Mladen and George. The alliance against Dimitri may have been related to the struggle between the two Nemanjić branches, as Dimitri had was married to Komnena Nemanjić, a daughter of Stefan. By 1212, the Venetians had left Arbanon, abandoning it to Michael Angelos, in circumstances that remain uncertain. Arbanon remained to its traditional fidelities, Byzantine and Serbian, Orthodox; when Dimitri died, Gregory Kamonas succeeded in ruling Arbanon, and took Komnena as his second wife; ties were strengthened with Serbia, with which ties had been weakened by a Serbian attack on Scutari following the collapse of the Venetian duchy of Durazzo.There are no historical accounts of George's activities from the time of July 1208 treaty through 1216. By 1216, Stefan had obtained Zeta, probably through military action, and put an end to Zetan independence. Stefan eventually assigned Zeta to his own son Stefan Radoslav, though recently scholars believe that he retained the province for himself. Zeta remained part of Serbia without any special legal position, and it was frequently held by the heir of the Serbian throne, who bore a title not connected to Zeta but his position in the Serbian court.

"Zaharije Orfelin (Serbian Cyrillic: e ; 1726 – 19 January 1785) was a Serbian polymath who lived and worked in the Austrian Monarchy and Venice. [SEP] Described as a Renaissance man, he was an educator, theologist, administrator, poet, engraver, lexicographer, herbalist, historian, translator, editor, publisher, polemicist, polyglot, a prominent oenologist, and traveler. His nephew is the painter Jakov Orfelin.    In 1757 Orfelin became the secretary to Metropolitan Pavle Nenadović in Sremski Karlovci, the Serbian political and spiritual centre at the time. Metropolitan Pavle wanted to establish Karlovci as an independent educational centre and evade Imperial Austrian control over censorship. In collaboration with Zaharije Orfelin, he founded the ""Copper Publishing House"", where the first modern Orthodox literary works and a considerable number of prints were made. Soon Orfelin began publishing poems, translating books, and creating etchings and engravings, inspired by the work of his contemporaries. To fulfill his ambition to print more books, he moved to Venice where he founded and edited the first Serbian review, Slaveno-Serbski Magazin (1768). Poem Plač Serbii [The Lament of Serbia] and biography of Peter I of Russia Istorija o žitija i slavnih djelah velikago gosudarja i imperatora Petra Pervago are considered his most notable works.  His Slaveno-Serbski Magazin paved the way to the Slavonic-Serbian language. He was the first to publish in the 18th century texts pertaining to Serbian social and cultural history when other European nations had yet to entertain the subjects. During this period Orfelin first began to write The Big Serbian Herbalium, in which he detailed the sanative effects of 500 species of herbs. And, in the Experienced Winemaker he listed several hundreds of recipes for preparation of herbal wines and other potions. Orfelin was fluent in Russian, Latin, German, and French.  The Lament of Serbia is regarded as the most notable among his poetic works of that period. He first published it anonymously in Venice in 1761. In this ode he fiercely pilloried the establishment of the Austrian Empire and the Roman Catholic Church, while also emphasizing the difficult position and unjust treatment of the Serbs under the Imperial protection. Even though the poem bore no signature, the authorship was soon discovered. It is believed that this was a reason for his hurried exit from Karlovci the following year. After leaving Metropolitan Pavle, Orfelin moved to Timișoara, the capital of the Eparchy of Banat, where he secured employment as the chancellor of the Serbian Bishop of Banat, Vikentije Jovanović Vidak. In the years he spent in Timișoara he produced The Apostolic Milk, a catechism dedicated to his infant son in 1763. In 1764, Orfelin came to Dimitrios Theodosios's publishing house in Venice, where he spent the next six years before moving back to Karlovci. Theodosios, who began to print Serbian books in Venice in 1758, needed Orfelin to edit and proofread the abundant material being brought to him. Theodosios remained the only outlet for Serbian literature and printed books in Russo-Slavonic until the emergence of Kurtbek's publishing house in Vienna in 1770. Orfelin's editorial work gave a special impetus to the success of this Slavic publishing house. In a span of a few years many important books – ""Catechisis"" by Peter Mohyla and another ""Catechisis"" by Jovan Rajić, ""Srbljak"" (a compedium of old Serbian writings) and ""Short Stories"" by Feofan Prokopovich – were published there. Many of the books published were either translated or edited by Orfelin himself. He also published his own, original works, including ""A Melody for the Spring"" and ""A Historical Poem"" in 1765, ""Latin Alphabet"" in 1767, and ""Latin Grammar"" and ""Slavic Alphabet"" in 1768. A large number of the books printed in Theodosios's shop in Venice were purposefully mislabelled as printed in either Moscow or Sankt Petersburg publishing houses. The reasoning behind it was that Serbs under the Austrian rule had more faith in books published in Russia than in the West. While still in Venice, Orfelin also printed one of the most important copper engravings, St. George with the Image of the Monastery of Sendjuradj (1767), and the first one that he signed as a member of the Imperial Engraving Academy founded by Austrian Jacob Schmutzer.     Orfelin was one of the most notable representatives of the Serbian Baroque literature (although he worked in the first half of the 18th century, as Baroque trends in Serbian literature emerged in the late 17th century); yet his writings bear certain ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Through the whole of the 18th century, Serbian literature was mostly under the sway of Russia, or rather of the Russian Orthodox Church. As the Russo-Slavonic language was not readily understood by the Serbian reading public, its form used by the Serbs came under the influence of their living dialect and began soon to approach nearer to Serbian than to Russian. This artificial literary jargon was called Slaveno-Serbski, Slavo-Serbian. (In the 19th century it was eventually superseded by the modern Serbian language owing to the efforts and reforms of Vuk Karadžić). Of the Serbian authors who followed the Russian models it is worth to mention Zaharije Orfelin, Gligorije Trlajić (1766–1811), and Pavle Solarić (1781–1821). In Serbian eighteenth-century literature Orfelin's authorship of ""The Life of Peter the Great"" was recorded for the first time in 1786, by Jovan Muškatirović. The illustrations of Peter's Life had been announced by Orfelin in 1772, but he began to produce them in 1774, and the whole enterprise was not completed until 1779, when the authorship of the book had been indubitably established. All this, however, was forgotten and Dimitrije Ruvarac discovered again in 1887, on the basis of the signed illustrated copies of the ""Life of Peter the Great"", that Orfelin was the author of the Russian emperor's biography. This nineteenth-century discovery was accepted by both Serbs and Russians. In 1776 Orfelin's name appears in a lexicon of Austrian artists, Des Gelehte Osterisch by de Luca, where he is listed as both an engraver and a writer, elected as an academician in the newly established Academy of Engraving in Vienna. He is the main character of a novel ""Drugo Telo"" by Milorad Pavić.   "
"Pietro Castrofilaca (Greek:  ) was a Venetian notary and accountant, His name in Greek language means keeper of the castle, probably born in the city of Candia (modern Heraklion). Castrofilaca was the secretary of the syndics Zuanne Gritti and Giulio Garzoni. [SEP] He is known for the census he carried out in the 16th century. Castrofilaca conducted a systematic recording of the population of Crete. His census was based on an earlier census carried out in 1577 by the predictor Foscarini.

"Demetrio Progoni (Albanian: Dhimitër Progoni) was Albanian leader who ruled as Prince of the Albanians from 1208 to 1216 the Principality of Arbanon, the first Albanian state. [SEP] He was the successor and brother of Gjin Progoni and their father, Progon of Kruja. His father was Progon of Kruja. Following the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade, he managed to further secure the independence of Arbanon and extended its influence to its maximum height. Throughout much his rule he was in struggle against the Republic of Venice, Zeta of Đorđe Nemanjić and later the Despotate of Epiros and inversely, maintained good relations with their rivals, the Republic of Ragusa, and at first Stefan Nemanjić of Raška, whose daughter Komnena he married. The Gëziq inscription found in the Catholic church of Ndërfandë (modern Gëziq) shows that by the end of his life he was a Catholic. In Latin documents, of the time, he is often styled as princeps Arbanorum (prince of the Albanians) and in Byzantine documents as megas archon and later as Panhypersebastos. Under increasing pressure from the Despotate of Epiros, his death around 1216 marks the end of Arbanon as a state and the beginning of a period of autonomy until its final ruler Golem of Kruja joined the Nicaean Empire. The annexation sparked the Rebellion of Arbanon in 1257. He didn't have any sons to continue his dynasty, but his wealth and a part of his domain in Mirdita passed after Demetrio's death to his underage nephew, Progon (son of Gjin), whom he named protosevastos. The Dukagjini family which appeared in historical record 70 years later in the same region may have been relatives or direct descendants of the Progoni.In historical record, Demetrio Progoni is the first ruler to call himself Prince of the Albanians and the first to identify his domain as Principatum Albaniae (Principality of Albania/Arbanon). Many later feudal rulers of Albania would lay claim to the same title and present their rule as the continuation of this state. The first to do so was Charles I of Anjou who sought to legitimize the Kingdom of Albania as a descendant state of the Principality of Arbanon about 60 years later, in 1272.    Progon of Kruja, father of Dhimitër Progoni formed the first Albanian state during the Middle Ages. Little is known about archon Progon who ruled Krujë and its surroundings at least since the era between 1190 and 1198. The Krujë castle and other territories remained in the possession of the Progon family, and Progon was succeeded by his sons Gjin, and later Demetrio. Before 1204, Arbanon was an autonomous principality of the Byzantine Empire. The fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, had two main political consequences for the region of Albania. The first was that Byzantine overlordship had crumbled, which allowed for the local rulers to seek independence. The second was that in accordance to the agreements about the partition of the Byzantine Empire, control of Albania had been awarded to the Republic of Venice. In this geopolitical environment, Dhimitër Progoni assumed power in 1207-08. In primary sources of the period, he is mostly referred to as Demetrius (Demetrius, Progoni archontis filius et successor) or Demetrio Progoni.     Since the beginning of his rule, Progoni sought out to create friendly networks in foreign policy in order to preserve the sovereignty of Arbanon against external threats, the most important of whom were for much of his reign the Republic of Venice and later the Despotate of Epiros. In 1208-09, he considered conversion to Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy for the first time in order to obtain support against his Venetian rivals. As Venice had been given the nominal rights to control Albania, conversion to Catholicism would nullify Venetian claims over territory controlled by another Catholic state, the Principality of Arbanon. It would also protect him from expansion by post-Byzantine successor states like the Despotate of Epiros. In his preserved correspondence with Pope Innocent III, Progoni as leader of the iudices of Arbanon, who signed as his followers, asked the Pope to send missionaries to spread Catholicism in his land. The Pope responded that Nicolaus, the Catholic archdeacon of Durrës had been instructed to make preparations for the mission. Shortly after, however, Demetrio stopped the process because he didn't consider it important any longer. He had defeated  Đorđe Nemanjić, a Venetian vassal whom he bordered to the north and thus felt less threatened by Venice. Nemanjić had previously promised military support to Venice if Progoni attacked Venetian territory, in a treaty signed on 3 July 1208. He also had secured a marriage with Komnena Nemanjić, who was both the daughter of Stefan Nemanjić, rival of Đorđe Nemanjić and grand-daughter of the last Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos. In this context, because of the relation of his consort to the Byzantine imperial family, he was recognized by the title of panhypersevastos. After the death of the Catholic archbishop of Durrës, the Venetians and Progoni - each in their respective territories - seized church property. For his actions against church property, he was excommunicated. He used the title princeps Arbanorum (""prince of the Albanians"") to refer to himself and was recognized as such by foreign dignitaries. In the correspondence with Innocent III, the territory he claimed as princeps Arbanorum was the area between Shkodra, Prizren, Ohrid and Durrës (regionis montosae inter Scodram, Dyrrachium, Achridam et Prizrenam sitae). In general, Progoni brought the principality to its climax. The area the principality controlled, ranged from the Shkumbin river valley to the Drin river valley in the north and from the Adriatic sea to the Black Drin in the east.  In Latin documents, he was is also referred to as iudex. In Byzantine records, he is titled as megas archon and after the consolidation of his rule as panhypersebastos.In search for allies, he also signed a treaty with the Republic of Ragusa which allowed for free passage of Ragusan merchants in Albanian territory. In 1210, an agreement was concluded between the Republic of Venice and Michael I Komnenos Doukas of the Despotate of Epiros under which Doukas would become a vassal of Venice, if the republic recognized his claims up to the Shkumbin river valley, a core area of Arbanon. In 1212, Venice also allowed for the possession of the coastal duchy of Durrës to pass to Michael and abandoned its direct control of central Albania. The agreement had dire consequences for the principality, which surrounded by hostile forces, seems to have been reduced by the end of the life of Dhimitër Progoni to the area north of Shkumbin and south of Drin. Evidence for this period has been provided by the foundational inscription of the Catholic church of Gëziq in the Ndërfandë near modern Rreshen in Mirdita. The inscription is written in Latin and has been produced after Progoni's death. The inscription shows that Progoni, who had been reaccepted in the Catholic Church, had provided funds for the building of the church, which he might have planned to become the seat of the Diocese of Arbanum or a new diocese in the centre of his remaining domain. This is indicated by the fact that the new church was built on the site of an older church dedicated to St. Mary but Progoni dedicated the new church to Shën Premte, the patron saint of Arbanum. He had maintained the semi-independence of this area under an agreement in which he accepted the high suzerainty of Zeta and the rulers of Zeta didn't get involved in internal affairs of the region in return. In the inscription which also serves as the last will of Progoni, the church is dedicated to his people (nationi obtulit) and his successor is designated, Progon - son of Gjin Progoni - as protosevastos.     He died around 1215-16. His wife was soon married off to Gregory Kamonas who needed the wedding to happen in order legitimize succession of power. After he took control of Kruja, strengthening relations with Grand Principality of Serbia, which had  weakened after a Slavic assault on Scutari. Komnena had a daughter with Kamonas that married Golem, who continued to rule as a semi-independent ruler in Arbanon under Theodore Komnenos Doukas of the Despotate of Epiros (until 1230) and then Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria until his death in 1241. He then oscillated between Doukas and the Nicaeans until he was finally annexed by the Nicaeans in the phase of reconstitution of the Byzantine Empire in 1252-56. The events prompted the Rebellion of Arbanon in 1257. The Principality of Arbanon is the first Albanian state that emerged in the Middle Ages. Under Progoni, it reached its maximum extent. Progoni was the first to use the terms Princeps Arbanorum and Princeps Albaniae. The legacy of a local, independent power center in Albania was used by future rulers to legitimize their power by presenting their realms as its successors. The first to do so was Charles I of Anjou with the creation of  Kingdom of Albania around 70 years later. In Albanian historiography, his attempt has been assessed negatively as an ""Anjou invention"" which sought to turn Albania into an armed base for Angevin campaigns in contrast to the Principality of Arbanon, which was an attempt of local unification and independence from the Byzantines.Progoni didn't have any sons. His successor was his nephew, Progon. The rule of this Progon in the Mirdita area, the many similarities between the emblem of the Progoni family in the Gëziq inscription and the coat of arms of the later Dukagjini family and the claim of the Dukagjini that they were the hereditary overlords of Ndërfandë and the abbacy of Gëziq has led historians to consider that the two clans may have been related or even that the Dukagjini were descendants of the Progoni via protosevastos Progon.The connection of the church of Ndërfandë with the Diocese of Arbanum and consequently with the territory of Arbanon led to later disputes. The Dukagjini who held hereditary rights over the region, were in actual control of the abbacy. Gjon Kastrioti who held control of the territory of the diocese of Arbanum claimed that the abbacy should pass into his territory. The dispute was solved with mediation by the Papacy, which transferred it to the Diocese of Lezhë which had been formed in the 15th century and was de jure part of the Dukagjini lands.   "
"Staniša Radonjić (Serbian Cyrillic:  ), known as Staniša Popov ( ; fl. 1682 - 1693), was a Serbian Orthodox priest, chieftain (vojvoda) of the Njeguši tribe, and Serdar of the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro. [SEP]    Staniša was born the son of a priest (hence popov), of the Radonjić-Rajićević brotherhood. He is believed to have been first mentioned in the mid-17th century as living in Njeguši. He was a priest, and the chieftain (vojvoda) of the Njeguši tribe. In 1682, he gave the mitre (a ceremonial head-dress for bishops), which he had paid for to be done, to the treasury of Cetinje as a gift to Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan Visarion Borilović (s. 1674–1692). In 1687, Staniša gained notability in trade relations with Kotor, which at the time was part of the Republic of Venice. That year Staniša and Ivan Maričević obliged to the Kotoran court that they would purchase fine wool within ten days from the receival of 435 reals from captain Bernardo Paulucci. On 8 September 1693, he is mentioned (as Stanissa Popov del Comune di Gnegussi) in the agreement between the Katun tribes and the Venetian government (the Dalmatian provveditore) in Kotor.  In 1700, Staniša became creditor to the Venetian Republic.In 1697, Danilo Šćepčević of the Petrović-Heraković brotherhood of Njeguši was appointed Metropolitan of Cetinje.  This marked the beginning of what is known in modern historiography as the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro under the hereditary Metropolitans of Cetinje of the Petrović family.  It is believed that Metropolitan Danilo adopted the title of serdar in his government in 1718 when he appointed ""guvernaduri and some serdari and knezovi ... to judge and discipline the people"". Of this appointed serdar, Staniša is the only one known in historiography.  In the beginning, Staniša was only the serdar of a nahija, however, thanks to the prominence of his family and relations to the Venetians, he seized the title as the title of serdar of all of Montenegro. His seal, found in Venetian archives, reads ""Staniša, the priest's son, serdar of Montenegro"" (»staniša popov srdar černie gori«). As Staniša became serdar and the title became hereditary to the Radonjić brotherhood, the Njeguši tribe was led by the serdar instead of the earlier vojvoda. Later, the significance of the ""serdar of all Montenegro"" fell, and it remained as a traditional function of a manager, now under the name of guvernadur.He died in ca. 1720. He had three sons: Vukoslav (Vukosav), Jovan (Jovo) and Marko. After him, his son Vuk, his grandson Stano and his great-grandson Vukolaj III held the position of guvernadur until 1832.    On the right central icon of Jesus Christ with the apostles in the church of Holy Mary (sv. Gospođa) on Njeguši, the work of Maksim Tujković from 1720, it mentions the children of Staniša: Vukosav, Jovo and Marko. In that same church, Staniša is mentioned in an inscription by Rafailo Dimitrijević from 1756. In the folk song about the events from the historical period encompassing his tenure as Serdar c. 1719, the words Stanišić Tower and Stanišić Vuk are mentioned.    He had three sons:  Vuk (or Vukosav/Vukajlo/Vukale/Vukolaj I), priest and serdar of all Montenegro Stanislav ""Stano"" Radonjić (1690-1758), vojvoda, serdar, first guvernadur (1756-1758) Vukajlo/Vukale (or Vukolaj II), guvernadur (1758-1764) Jovan (Joko), guvernadur (1764-1802) Vukolaj III, guvernadur (1804-1832) Jovo Popov Marko   "

"Stefano Zannowich (Serbian:  /Stefan or Stjepan Zanović, (Budva, Venetian Albania, 18 February 1751–Amsterdam, Dutch Republic, 25 May 1786), called Hanibal,  was a Montenegrin Serb count, adventurer and writer of ""Turkish Letters"". He wrote in Italian, French, Latin, German, and Serbian. [SEP] He was a pen pal of Gluck, Pietro Metastasio, Voltaire, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Catherine the Great, and Frederick William II of Prussia, to whom he dedicated a book of French verses translated from Italian, ""L'Alcoran des Princes Destinés au Trone"". Giacomo Casanova mentions Stefano Zannovich, who ""paid a visit to Vienna under the alias of Prince Castriotto d'Albanie. Under pressure of the authorities, he left at the end of July 1784"" for Poland and later for the Netherlands (United Provinces).    He was born to the Paštrovići clan near Budva, Venetian Albania (now Montenegro), and committed suicide in an Amsterdam jail. He was the fourth child of Antun ""Budaljanin"", a wealthy merchant and shoemaker, and his wife Franka (née Marković). He had older brothers named Marko (b. 1745), Primislav (b. 1747) and his namesake Stjepan (b. 1749) who died at an early age. After him, his parents had Vincislav (b. 1755) and Miroslav (1761-1834), and two daughters, Marija Jelisaveta (b. 1753) and Teresia Giustiniana (b. 1758). Large number of siblings allowed them to constantly change identities, falsely impersonating one another, often making confusion by allegedly appearing in two places at the same time. His oldest brother Marko went to Russia in 1781 and became a count, living in Škłoŭ on the estate of Semyon Zorich. In 1783 he was arrested alongside his brother Anibal, for covering his brother's money counterfeiting operation. Mentioned Anibal is not the same person as Stjepan, more likely Primislav who used the same alias. They were imprisoned in Siberia until 1788 when they were pardoned by Catherine due to Zorich's intervention and because of Stjepan's fame in western Europe, where he always glorified Russian empress. Upon release they left for Arhangelsk, not to be mentioned again. His youngest brother Miroslav also adopted the title of count, enrolled in politics as a staunch opponent of Venetian aspirations towards Dalmatia and a freemason. He was a delegate of Budva on the unification assembly of Montenegro and Boka in 1813. He also published the book Thoughts and sonnets and died at a very old age in 1834. Of all his relatives, Stjepan, alongside Primislav who was often his partner in con schemes, is perhaps the best known. Stjepan claimed descendance from Skanderbeg. Stefan completed his education in Venice and Padua. He met Casanova through his brother Primislav in Florence, where he was part of the Accademia degli Apatisti, better known as the Accademia Fiorentina. In Florence he made his first moves by bankrupting certain English lord in the game of cards, for which he was expelled from Florence. In 1769 both he and his brother were expelled from Venice, as well as from Treviso the following year for document forgery and false representation. Somewhere after 1772 he undertook a trip to London in order to collect his card winnings. During this voyage he visited much of the France, including Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Lyon and eventually Paris, where he was moving in social circles around Encyclopédistes, thus meeting d'Alembert, Marmontel and Rousseau. His first works Opera diverse and Poesie were printed in 1773 in Paris and Milan respectively.    Zannowich's life is full of controversy, scarce on facts and full of fictional events that were the most likely product of his own imagination. Various fragments were recorded by his acquaintances. Apparently, at the age of 17, after a robbery he committed, he escaped to Dalmatia and became a brigand leader. Later he came to Montenegro, where, by his own account, he presented himself as Russian tsar Peter III and became the head of the country. Zannowich did, in fact, visit Montenegro on 5 May 1774 with unclear motifs. Obviously seeking to profit from the power vacuum after the death of Stephen the Little, the actual impostor of Peter III, he later took over his identity and presented himself across Europe as the man who caused such political intrigue. It is widely regarded as true that he actually met Stephen, even writing a couple of words about him in 1784, in which he made a clear distinction between the two of them. He mentioned himself in the passage as being one of Stephen's generals in the latter's battles against the Turks. After the supposed meeting he left Montenegro for the first time in 1769 for Vienna only to return five years later. While in Vienna he tried to gain support from local Orthodox deacons for his plan to seize the power in Montenegro, and it is at this point that he started his quest on proving his own noble heritage, alleged connection with Skenderbeg, etc. He claimed that the people of Montenegro as well as Prince-bishop Sava were asking him to take over the country, but that his adventurous spirit was longing for something more. In reality, he was expelled by Montenegrins who wanted to avoid being clutched by yet another impostor. So, he left the country for the second time and accompanied by archimandrite Petar I, who would later become metropolitan himself, and a group of Montenegrins he reached Vienna through Rijeka. Once in Vienna he split with his traveling group and via Strasbourg and Frankfurt he left for Poland. There he took an alias Niarta and became the protégé of the prince Michał Kazimierz Ogiński, whom he exploited financially. In 1775 he went to Dresden where his Opere Postume and Lettere turche were printed, then moving to Berlin the following year. There he failed to gain the trust of Frederick the Great, who immediately saw right through him, but in turn grew increasingly close with his heir Frederick William II. Johann Christian von Mannlich recounts how well he was received in Zweibrücken in 1778, only to be arrested and his residence permit denied after an incriminating letter against him arrived from Berlin. Spending some time under various false identities in Alsace and Lorraine, he arrived in Rome where, despite an age difference, he started an affair with Duchess of Kingston. The pair then left for Russia. In 1780 he was in Groningen, moving to Amsterdam and eventually ending in Antwerpen. There he befriended Charles-Joseph de Ligne, who dedicated a poem to Stefan, and spent six months enjoying his hospitality at Château de Belœil. During his stay in Belgium, clearly not eager to abandon his political ambitions involving Montenegro, he devised a plan to place the country under the protection of Joseph II, whose intervention saved him from prison in Vienna in 1778. He claimed to be able to assemble up to 10,000 Montenegrins ready to fight for the emperor's interests in Austrian Netherlands. Stefan's plot collapsed while he was in Ath, from where he left yet another time for Frankfurt, where he resided from 19 March to 12 June in 1784. Living off various hoaxes and frauds, he there collected 5,764 Dutch guilders from a bank using a false promissory note from Duchess of Kingston. On 11 August 1784, he arrived in Frauenbrünnl monastery in Abbach near Straubing and presented himself as an exiled prince seeking sanctuary and peace, thus spending some time there, making it his seat of operations in the process. He regularly paid visits to Augsburg, Regensburg and Munich, establishing contacts with wealthy merchants and persuading them to enter Dutch market where he had considerable influence. During his time in Frauenbrünnl, he rarely left his room and often made overgenerous contributions to the poor locals.    The most important work, Turska pisma or Turkish Letters (Lettere turche, original title) by Stefano Zannowich, first published in Dresden in 1776, Serbian literary historiography never treated them as a novelist. With the latest research and study, Zannowich's work now belongs to the genre of an epistolary novel, a form especially popular in the Age of Enlightenment.  La Didone, scena drammatica.

"Marin Barleti (Latin: Marinus Barletius, Italian: Marino Barlezio; c. 1450–1460 – c. 1512-1513) was a historian and Catholic priest from Shkodra. [SEP] He is considered the first Albanian historian because of his 1504 eyewitness account of the 1478 siege of Shkodra. Barleti is better known for his second work, a biography on Skanderbeg, translated into many languages in the 16th to the 20th centuries.    Barleti was born and raised in Scutari (modern Shkodra, Albania), then part of the Republic of Venice. Although there is no debate whether Barleti was a native Shkodran or an Albanian in a geographical sense, scholars variously assert that he was of Italian (DuCange, Iorga), Dalmatian (Giovio, Czwittinger, Fabricius), or Albanian (Zeno, Fallmerayer, Jireček) ethnic origin. In his works Barleti repeatedly calls himself Shkodran (Latin: Scodrensis), and then equates being Shkodran with being Epirote, a term used by early Albanian language authors as an equivalent form of the ethnonym ""Albanian"".In 1474, the Ottoman Empire besieged Shkodra and Barleti participated in the successful defense of the town, both in the first siege in 1474 and the second in 1478. When Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottomans in 1479, Barleti escaped to Italy where he would become a scholar of history, classical literature and the Latin language. Soon after Barleti arrived in Venice, he was given a stall at the Rialto meat market as a temporary means of financial aid. In 1494 became a priest after his theological studies in Venice and Padova, and soon was appointed to serve at St. Stephen's Church in Piovene.   "
"Mercurio Bua (Albanian: Mërkur Bua; Greek:  , romanized: Merkourios Bouas) Count of Aquino and Roccasecca (1478 in Nafplion – c.1542 in Treviso) was a famed condottiero (stratioti captain) and commander of the Venetian army. [SEP] In some sources he was referred to as Buia.     Born in Nafplion in the Peloponnese, Mercurio was the son of Peter Bua (fl. 1450s), who belonged to the Albanian noble family of Bua that settled in Peloponnese, and who was the leader of the Albanian community of the region after the fall of the Despotate of the Morea. His uncle Constantine Arianiti, a nobleman of the Holy Roman Empire, was the Count of Montferrat. Due to his martial prowess, he was eventually made Count of Aquino and Roccasecca (of the Holy Roman Empire). In 1519, he married Maria Boccali, the daughter of Niccolò Boccali. Maria died in 1524 leaving one son with the name Flavio. She was buried in Santa Maria di Treviso. In 1525 Mercurio married Elisabetta, daughter of Alvise Balbi. With her Mercurio had four children: Helena Maria, Curio, Polyxena and Alessandro. Elizabeth died in or before 1528.The life of Bua had been dramatised in the works of Tzanes Koronaios. Koronaios, who had been stradiotti-troubadour of Zantiote origin, was a companion of Merkourios Bouas. In his work, a long epic poem in vernacular Greek on the exploits of Merkourios Bouas, Koronaios gives Bua's mythological pedigree, which includes Achilles, Alexander the Great and Pyrrhus. This poem was found in a manuscript in Italy and was published partially by C. Hopf and entire by K. Sathas. It was written in 1519 when Coroneos was in Venice and refers to Bua's history till 1517. It consists of about 4.500 rhyming verses and contains valuable historical information. Coroneos wrote and sent to Bua also a smaller poem (“pittakion”) of about 125 verses in Greek language, too.Another mention of a Mercurio Bua exists in the Histoire des guerres civiles de France by Enrico Caterino Davila. There a man named Mercurio Bua was active in the service of the king of France in the 1580s. He was present as a commander of a unit of light cavallery at the Battle of Coutras in 1587, leading an ill-fated cavallery charge that led to his unit being diverted away from the decisive action, thus contributing to a catastrophic defeat of the royal army. Nevertheless, it is unknown if it is the same person. M. Bua died in Treviso, (Italy), between 1527 and 1562, where earlier he served as captain of a unit of 50 soldiers. He is buried in Santa Maria Maggiore in the same city. In 1562 a marble monument was erected on his tomb, made by Antonio Lombardo. In 1637 the following inscription was made on the monument: ""Mercurio Bua Comiti E. Principibus Peloponnesi Epirotarum Equitum Ductori,Anno Salu. MDCXXXVII."" Which means ""To Count Mercurio Bua, Prince of Peloponnesus, Leader of the Epirote Horsemen, Year of our Salvation, 1637"". The monument also lists some of his military career.

"Pjetër Bua (or Boua; fl. 1450s) was an Albanian nobleman of the late medieval Despotate of the Morea (Peloponnese) who was the chief instigator of the Morea revolt of 1453–1454.

After the revolt failed, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II (r. 1444‒1446; 1451‒1481), surnamed the Conqueror, recognized Pjetër Bua as the spokesperson of the Albanian population of the Morea.

"The Greek community in Venice dates back to the Middle Ages, when the Republic of Venice was still formally part of the Byzantine Empire. [SEP] Settled mostly in the sestiere of Castello, it reached its height in the centuries after the Fall of Constantinople, when many Greeks, including merchants, soldiers, and scholars, fled the Ottoman conquest. Tied to the Greek world through its extensive overseas possessions, the city became a major center for Greek education and the Modern Greek Enlightenment, but declined after the Fall of the Venetian Republic and the establishment of the modern Greek state. The community's property is now largely owned and managed by the Hellenic Institute of Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Studies in Venice.    Scuola dei Greci San Giorgio dei Greci Flanginian School   "
"Krokodeilos Kladas (Greek:  , 1425–1490), also known as Korkodeilos, Krokondeilos, or Korkondelos, was a Greek military leader, specifically an armatolos, in the Morea (medieval Peloponnese) who fought against the Ottomans on behalf of the Republic of Venice during the latter 15th century. [SEP]     Krokodeilos Kladas, whose family migrated from Epirus to the Peloponnese, was born in Koroni in 1425; his father was the Greek military chief Theodore Kladas. When the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II (r. 1444–1446 and 1451–1481) took the Morea in 1460, Kladas handed over his castle of Saint George (Agios Giorgios) and was given in exchange the castle of Vardounia in Upper Mani and the territory of Elos. By 1465, the Kladas brothers, Krokodeilos and Epifani, were leading bands of stratioti (warrior bands) on behalf of Venice against the Turks. They put Vardounia and their lands into Venetian possession, for which Epifani then acted as governor. The Kladas brothers were frequently complimented by Venetian officials, and received generous Venetian gifts. Krokodeilos Kladas and his followers stood as rebels against Mehmed, but the Venetian-Ottoman peace settlement, while giving them a full pardon, also returned territorial boundaries to what they had been in 1463, so this put the Venetian-Kladas land holdings back into Ottoman possession. Kladas moved to Venetian-held Koroni. On October 9, 1480, Kladas led stratioti from Koroni to attack Ottoman holdings in Mani. Both the Ottomans and the Venetians put a price on his head; the latter, specifically, ""put a bounty of 10,000 hyperpyrai from the mint of Methone on Kladas' head."" This revolt was joined in December by stratioti from Nafplion led by Theodore Bua. An army sent by the Sultan was defeated between Passavas and Oitylo in February 1481. Later that month, a larger force under Mohammed Bey drove Kladas to Porto Kagio where he was taken on board a Neapolitan galley, leaving his revolt to wither in his absence. A peaceful settlement of the revolt was negotiated by the Ottoman governor of the Morea and Venetian official Bartolomeo Minio. Meanwhile, Kladas went with a Neapolitan army to Albania to aid an anti-Ottoman revolt there. It is not known when he returned to Mani. He was captured in battle near Monemvasia in 1490 and flayed alive.    The Kladas family is known in records from the Morea since 1296 when a ""Corcondille"" managed to capture a Frankish-held castle for the Byzantines. Members of the family made donations to a monastery at Mistra in 1366 and 1375. A Krokodeilos is identified as one of the rebels against the Emperor Manuel II in 1415. The ""Crocodile"" pun made there is a single appearance and never appears in contemporary documents relating to this Krokodeilos Kladas. The carved inscription on a donation to a church in Karytaina with the name transliterated as ""Krokontēlos"" is probably not related to him, and the carving is dated to the mid-14th century. He and his brothers are strongly praised in Venetian sources. Kladas had been awarded a Venetian knighthood (and a gold robe) just before the 1480 revolt. Members of the family moved to Kefalonia and continued to lead stratioti in Venetian service for at least another hundred years.   "
"Onufri Argitis or Onoufrios of Neokastro or Onoufrios Argytes (Greek: ) was an Orthodox icon painter and Archpriest of Elbasan, active in the 16th century in southern Albania and south-western Macedonia. [SEP] His works are characterized by post-Byzantine and Venetian influences. He also painted portraits, landscapes, and churches.    Little is known with certainty about Onufri's life and his existence only emerged in the early 20th century. Regarding his birthplace only an inscription in the Holy Apostles church, near Kastoria has survived. Onufri is believed to have been born in the early 16th century either in the region of Berat (in today's Albania) or near Kastoria or Grevena (in today's northern Greece). The epithet Argitis, which appears in a fresco near Kastoria may point to Argos as his place of birth, although as he used it only once it is regarded probable that it refers to a location in the area of Kastoria. His flawless Greek calligraphic inscriptions is an indicator that he received high-level education. He was educated in the Republic of Venice and was a member of the Greek Brotherhood of Venice.In the climate of the time, the painting of Christian icons can be seen as an act to restore pre-Ottoman culture. He was active in Berat and possibly Venice until 1547. Then he worked in both Berat and Kastoria and in 1555, in Shelcan near Elbasan. He may have also been the painter of various murals in the church of St. Nicholas near Prilep (North Macedonia). After 1554, he lived and painted in the village of Valsh. In a number of churches his works were signed with the title ""Protopapas"" (Greek: ), demonstrating a senior position in the church hierarchy. However, his signature has not been preserved on icons that have been also attributed to him such as a Dodekaorton icon at that is preserved at the National Museum of Medieval Art in Korce.    Onufri introduced greater realism and individuality into facial expressions, breaking with the strict conventions of the time. He was the first to introduce the colour pink into icon painting. The secret of this colour was not passed on and died with him. His work is noted for the intense use of colours and the use of natural dyes.  According to Georgios Golobias the works of Onufri were significantly influenced by western art, as a result of his possible stay in Venice, being a member of the local Greek fraternity. On the other hand, Manolis Chatzidakis claims that western traces are few and they can be explained due to the contact with the paintings of the Cretan School.Onufri founded a school of painting in Berat, which was passed on to his son Nikolla, and upon his death to Onouphrios Cypriotes (Onufri Cypriota) and Kostandin Shpataraku.

"Theodore Spandounes (Greek:  , Italian: Teodoro Spandugino) was an early 16th-century Greek historian of noble Byzantine extraction, the son of exiles fleeing the Ottoman conquest of Byzantium who had settled in Venice in Italy. [SEP] As a youth he stayed with relatives in Ottoman-ruled Macedonia and visited the Ottoman capital at Constantinople, acquiring a knowledge of their history and culture. In later life he served successive Popes as a counsellor and repeatedly advocated the dispatch of a new Crusade against the Ottomans. His chief legacy is his Italian-language history on the origins of the Ottoman state and its history up to that time, whose first version was published in 1509 in Italian and was soon translated into French. Spandounes continued working on it, with the final version appearing in 1538. The work is disorganized and contains errors, but is extremely valuable as a historical source for its wealth of information.    Theodore Spandounes was most probably born in Venice, the son of Matthew Spandounes and Eudokia Kantakouzene. His father was a Greek soldier who entered the service of the Venetian Republic as a stradioti mercenary, and for unspecified exploits was raised to the title of Count and Imperial Knight of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Frederick III in 1454. He was also given a grant of land around the town of Loidoriki in Greece. This was a nominal grant meant as a gesture of honour, since the territory in question was under Ottoman control, but according to historian Donald Nicol it is possibly indicative of the Matthew's and his family's place of origin. On the other hand, both Spandounes and other members of the family still remaining in the Ottoman-ruled Balkans claimed descent from Constantinople itself, while some had settled in Venice as early as the 1370s. Theodore's mother was a descendant of the Kantakouzenoi, one of the most notable late Byzantine aristocratic lines, which had produced a number of emperors as well as rulers of the Despotate of the Morea in the Peloponnese. Apart from Theodore, the couple had at least two more children: a daughter, who married the Venetian citizen Michael Trevisan, and a son, Alexander, who became a merchant.Through his mother, Theodore had relatives among the powerful Christian families of the late Byzantine/early Ottoman era. His mother was the grand-daughter of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos. George was a cousin of the last two Byzantine emperors, John VIII Palaiologos and Constantine XI Palaiologos, while his sisters Irene and Helena married the Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković and the Emperor of Trebizond David respectively, another sister became the wife of King George VIII of Georgia, while one of George's daughters, Anna, married Vladislav Hercegović, Duke of Saint Sava. The Spandounes family also had influential members in the early Ottoman Balkans, most notably the wealthy merchant Loukas Spandounes in Thessalonica, who on his death in 1481 was buried in a splendid, Italianate (and probably built in and transported all the way from Venice) tomb in Hagios Demetrios. Although Theodore too had dealings with Thessalonica, however, he does not mention Loukas.    Theodore's mother died sometime before 1490, and his father sent Theodore, then still a child, to live with his great-aunt, Mara Branković. Mara was the daughter of Đurađ and Irene, who had been taken as one of the wives of the Ottoman Sultan Murad II. After Murad's death in 1451, Mara was allowed by her stepson Sultan Mehmed II, to retire to her estate at Ježevo, where she ""maintained a privileged and protected enclave of Christian faith"" (Nicol). It was in this ""exalted and privileged"" environment that Theodore was brought up, and it was there that he learned to speak some Turkish and acquired first-hand knowledge of Turkish customs and history. In 1503, he visited the Ottoman capital of Constantinople to aid his brother Alexander, who had been brought to financial ruin by the recently concluded Ottoman–Venetian war and the Ottomans' confiscation of Venetian goods. Upon his arrival, he found that his brother had died in the meantime. From 1509, he was forced to leave Venice and live in exile in France. It was during this exile that he composed the first draft of his history, which he dedicated to King Louis XII. This first version was translated into French by Balarin de Raconis in 1519, and was published in a modern edition in 1896 by  C. H. A. Schéfer.A devout but not dogmatic Christian, Spandounes was more attuned to Italian Renaissance humanism than religion. Conscious of his imperial Byzantine heritage, he was still ""not unduly bigoted"" against the Turks, having lived among them and come to know them. Nevertheless, the main aim of his work was to alert Western Christendom to the Turkish menace and rally it to a crusade to liberate his homeland. Despite 19th-century attempts to claim Spandounes for Greek nationalism, however, his cause was not limited to the Greek-speaking lands: Spandounes used the term ""Greece"" for the entirety of Europe, juxtaposed to Asia (perhaps echoing the Turkish division of largely Christian Rumelia from predominantly Muslim Anatolia), and saw himself as a defender of all of Christian Europe, not simply in the service of a particular nation. Although he remained an Orthodox Christian, Spandounes turned to the Roman Catholic Church for aid, and served as advisor and confidante to several Popes who would champion his cause, starting with Leo X (1513–21), for whom he prepared the second draft of his work in 1519. He fell out with Leo's successor, Pope Hadrian VI, who not only showed no interest in the war against the Turks, but also cut his family's pension, but resumed his position under Clement VII (1523–34) and Paul III (1534–49). In 1538 he produced the third and final version of his work, which he presented (in a French translation), to the French Dauphin, the future King Henry II of France. This version was published at Lucca in 1550 and—with many errors—at Florence in 1551, reprinted in 1654, and formed the basis for the first modern edition by the Greek scholar Konstantinos Sathas in 1890.Spandounes seems to have based his work on oral or documentary material available to him and his family, as well as unspecified ""Turkish annals"", but it is impossible to say which. There is notably almost no reference to the other post-1453 Greek historians, which as Nicol notes is possibly due to the fact that their works were not disseminated in printed form until much later. Likewise there is little to suggest that he knew and made use of the handful of Italian treatises on the Turks that were written at about the same time, except for the works of Marin Barleti, whom Spandounes mentions by name.

"Simone Stratigo (Greek:   , Symeon Filippos Stratigos; Italian: Simone Filippo Stratico; 1733–1824) was an Italian Greek mathematician and a nautical science expert who studied and lived in Padua and Pavia in 18th-century Italy. [SEP]    Simone Stratigo was born in 1733 as Symeon Filippos Stratigos to a family of Greek origin in Zara (modern Zadar in Croatia), part of Venetian Dalmatia at the time. His family were originally from Candia, Crete and had migrated to Dalmatia due to the Ottoman conquest of Crete in 1669. While still young, Simone and his brother studied in the University of Padua under the discipline of their uncle Antonio Stratico (Antonios Stratigos), who was an educated man, especially in things Greek, and was director of the Cottunio Greek college at the time. Stratigo graduated in medicine from the University of Padua, where at the age of twenty-five years he became a professor. He was a member of the delegation who traveled from Venice to England in 1761 to congratulate the new King George III, he remained in the country a few years to study and became a member of various academies including the Royal Society of London. At that time he was greatly impressed by the size and economic strength of the British navy. He soon moved back in Padua, where he replaced Giovanni Poleni the chair of Mathematics and Navigation. In this capacity, he studied extensively the water regime of the Republic of Venice, collaborating with various interventions in hydraulics. He participated in cleaning up the valleys of Verona and the regulation of the Brenta and Bacchiglione. In 1786, he joined as an ordinary member of the Accademia dei XL. With the fall of the Republic in 1801 he was invited to teach nautical science at the University of Pavia, and he also studied the teaching of physics under Alessandro Volta. During the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy was appointed Inspector General of Bridges and Roads, and among other positions he was President of the Academy of Fine Arts and Sciences Institute of Lombardy in Milan. In recognition of his work, he was elected senator in 1809. He received several international awards, including the title of Knight of the Legion of Honor and of the Iron Crown. The Emperor Francis I of Austria awarded him the Cross of the Order of Leopold, and the title of Professor Emeritus of the University of Padua and Pavia. Simone Stratigo died in Milan, Italy on 16 July 1824.   "
"Theodore Palaiologos (Italian: Teodoro Paleologo, Greek:  , romanized: Theodōros Palaiologos; 1452–1532) was a 15th- and 16th-century Greek stratiote (light-armed mercenary cavalryman) and diplomat in the service of the Republic of Venice and one of the key early formative figures of the Greek community in Venice. [SEP] He was not related to the Palaiologos dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, but his family may have been their distant cousins. Originally a soubashi (debt-collector/police enforcer) in Ottoman service in the Peloponnese, Theodore left Greece in 1478. He would serve as a stratiote for more than forty years, partaking in numerous battles and campaigns and would also serve as a military governor on the Venetian-held Greek island of Zakynthos for thirty years, from 1483 to 1513. As one of the most respected Greeks in Venice, the esteem held for Theodore by the Venetian government is probably what led to the Venetians allowing the local Greeks to construct their own Greek Orthodox church, San Giorgio dei Greci, in the city. After giving up soldiering in 1525, Theodore served as a diplomat and translator, and since he could speak Italian, Greek and Turkish, he accompanied Venetian ambassadors to the Ottoman Empire several times.       Theodore Palaiologos was born in 1452, the son of Paulos Palaiologos. Paulos was probably from the Morea (the medieval name for the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece) and Theodore was likely born at Mystras, the peninsula's capital. They shared their last name with the Palaiologos dynasty, the final ruling dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, but are unlikely to have been related to the imperial family. The Palaiologos family had been extensive even before they became the empire's ruling dynasty, so it is plausible that Theodore and his family were distant cousins of the emperors. Theodore had three siblings; Georgios (Giorgio or Zorzi in Italian), Matthew (who would become the abbot of a monastery on Zakynthos) and a sister whose name remains unknown.In his youth, Theodore originally worked as a soubashi (debt-collector/police enforcer) in the Peloponnese on behalf of the Ottoman Empire, which conquered the Morea in 1460, before he, his father, and his brother Georgios, took up service with the Republic of Venice as stratioti (light-armed mercenary cavalrymen) in 1478. In due time, Paulos, Theodore and Georgios would all rise through the ranks to become capo dei stratioti (""head of the stratioti"").     One of the earliest preserved references to Theodore is a 1479 decision by the Venetian Senate concerning him, which states that he had recently proven himself in battle on a campaign in Friuli.In 1483, Theodore and his brother Georgios were appointed as military governors on the Venetian-held Greek island of Zakynthos, being granted grand properties and salaries.On 15 November 1486, Theodore married Maria Kantakouzene in Corfu. She was the daughter of a Demetrios Kantakouzenos and a woman by the name of Simone Gudellina. Since Maria and her father appears to have been genuine members of the noble Byzantine Kantakouzenos family, Theodore's branch of the Palaiologoi must have had a certain noble status. Theodore and Maria had two sons; Paolo and Demetrio, and six daughters; Efrosina, Emilia, Lucia, Helena, Nicolosa and a sixth daughter whose name is unknown.In 1489, Theodore was granted the small island of Cranae by the Venetian government, but he soon ceded it to another family. In the autumn of 1495, he was present at a siege of Novara, where the Venetians attempted to take the city from France. In March 1496, Theodore was one of the c. 250 stratioti who accompanied Venetian naval captain Domenico Malipiero in a campaign in Savona. In 1500 he partook in the Siege of the Castle of Saint George on the island of Cephalonia. In December 1502, Theodore was captured at Canosa di Puglia by French troops, though he was soon freed. In February 1503, he was fighting alongside c. 300 other stratioti in Calabria. In August 1511 he was stationed as a guard at Treviso, and from 1511 to 1512 he is recorded as travelling around Italy, serving as a guard and scout. Theodore was taken captive at the Battle of La Motta (7 October 1513), but was released at the end of the month.In 1513, there was an earthquake on Zakynthos. Theodore's wife Maria died, their youngest daughter was maimed and their son Demetri was injured. Theodore decided to move both his own family, and the family of his brother Georgios, who had been killed in battle near Bressano in 1497, to Venice. Theodore had to look after and support his own eight underage children, Georgios's widow, Theodore, and Georgios's and Theodora's six children; Costantino, Niccolò, Zuanne, Alessandro, Elisabeta and a daughter of unknown name. After Theodore's oldest son Paolo was killed in 1525, Theodore also had to look after Paolo's wife, Emilia, and their six daughters. The large number of people he quickly became responsible for might be why Theodore gave up soldiering.    After 1525, Theodore became a diplomat in Venetian service. In addition to Greek and Italian, he also spoke Ottoman Turkish, and he frequently accompanied Venetian ambassadors and other officials on their visits to the eastern Mediterranean. Because they could speak Turkish, Theodore and his nephew Costantino (son of his brother Georgios) served as dragomani (translators/interpreters) for Ottoman dignitaries visiting Venice. Theodore had prior knowledge of diplomacy, having accompanied the Venetian ambassador Alvise Maneti to the Ottoman court in Adrianople in March 1500. In 1517, he was recorded as on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople, the Ottoman (and former Byzantine) capital. On account of his years of military service and his work as a diplomat and translator, the Venetian government awarded Theodore with their highest honor; bestowing upon him a Knighthood of Saint Mark.In addition to serving as a diplomat, Theodore also devoted himself to the Greek community in Venice, of which Theodore was one of the early key formative figures. The local Greeks had been petitioning the Venetian government for a Greek Orthodox church in the city since 1511, a cause which Theodore championed for years, regularly visiting officials and urging them to hand down a resolution. He was admired and respected by the other Greeks in the city. The esteem the Venetian government had for him is likely what eventually resulted in the construction of an Orthodox church in the city.Theodore was often called upon to settle disputes between towns and their hired stratioti, or between different quarreling bands of stratioti. In 1524, the town of Cattaro appealed to the Venetian government that their stratiote and military governor, Zuanne Paleologo (another son of Theodore's brother Georgios) spent most of his time in Cephalonia, away from the town he was supposed to protect. The people of Cattaro explicitly asked for ""Teodoro Paleologo, a loved and much desired man"" to travel to Cattaro and restore order. The Venetian senate agreed and on 2 September 1424, Theodore and his son Demetri were sent to Cattaro to replace Zuanne.Theodore died in 1532. His funeral took place on 3 September that same year and was a grand ceremony. His coffin was carried by a guard of honor of mariners to the temporary structures on the site were the city's Greek Orthodox church, San Giorgio dei Greci, was being built. Despite the building being a Greek Orthodox structure, representatives from local Roman Catholic churches, and other religious representatives, were present, as were dignitaries from the Venetian government. The funeral was held according to Greek rite, the customs of which were adhered to even by the Catholics present.   "

While in Florence, he studied Greek philosophy and literature under the tutelage of Demetrios Chalcondyles. In 1497, the University of Padua appointed Thomaeus as its first official lecturer on the Greek text of Aristotle. In 1504, he was elected to succeed Giorgio Valla as chair of Greek in Venice, but because Thomaeus failed to take the post seriously, he was succeeded in 1512 by Marcus Musurus. In 1524, Thomaeus published a collection of philosophical dialogues in Latin, the first of which was titled ""Trophonius, sive, De divinatione"". He was admired by scholars such as Desiderius Erasmus for his philological capabilities. When the University of Padua was reopened after the wars of the League of Cambrai, Thomaeus taught at the university until his death on March 28, 1531.   "
"Meletius Tipaldi (Italian: Meletio Tipaldi, Serbo-Croatian: Melentije/Meletije Tipaldi, Serbian Cyrillic:  ; fl. 1685–13 May 1713) was a bishop in Venetian Dalmatia. [SEP] He moved from the Orthodox to the Roman Catholic Church.    Until 1690, Tipaldi served the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. On 13 September in that year he called on Orthodox Christians to subjugate to Rome, and thenceforward he embraced Uniatism and officiated within the Roman Catholic Church. As the Archbishop of Philadelphia (now in Turkey) under the Patriarchate of Constantinople, he was the head of the Orthodox Christian population in Venetian territory, thus was recognized as the head of Orthodox Serbs in Dalmatia. The Catholic Church and Venetian government had pressured him to accept Uniatism. In order to ease the Uniatism of Orthodox Dalmatians, Tipaldi met with Nikodim Busović, a monk at the Krka Monastery, and had him appointed the bishop of Dalmatia in 1693. Nikodim would however resist Uniatism and be recognized as a Serbian Orthodox exarch. Tipaldi was excluded from the Orthodox church in 1712.   "
"Julije Balović (Cyrillic:  , Italian: Giulio Ballovich; March 24, 1672 – September 10, 1727) was an entrepreneur, polyglot, judge, sea captain Venetian military officer and collector of epic poetry from Venetian held Perast (modern-day Montenegro). Some sources speculated that he authored some of the literature works he collected. [SEP] Balović wrote several manuscripts which are considered as significant literature works and historical sources. His multilingual dictionary is one of the earliest records of Albanian language. Julije Balović belonged to noble Balović family from Perast. Following his father's footsteps, he became a sailor in Venetian navy and advanced from the rank of ship's scribe to shipmaster. He received numerous awards and gratitude letters for his successful participation in battles against pirates and Ottomans during the Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18).    Balović was born into the noble Balović family and lived in Perast (modern-day Montenegro). His father was Matija Balović who had seven sons and two daughters. Balović was married to Ana and had three daughters and four sons. Two of their sons died at a young age (Petar and Antun) while remaining the two sons (Julije and Petar) had no children so Julije's branch of the Balović family ceased to exist.    Balović began his sailing career in the Venetian navy as ship's scribe and gradually advanced to the ranks of pilot, lieutenant, captain and finally shipmaster. He served on different ships including ""Santa Croce"", ""Santa Antonio"" and ""Santa Cristoforo"". Balović participated in numerous naval battles with pirates from Tripoli and Ulcinj near Durazzo and Šćedro and also in some larger military conflicts like Siege of Corfu, Battle of Preveza, Saseno and Battle of Vonjice. At the beginning of 1715 he was commander of frigate from Perast that together with ship of Venetian fleet commander Lorenzo Bragadin blocked two galleys of Ulcinj pirates from in one port in Venetian Albania. On that occasion he demonstrated his perfect knowledge of Albanian coast.Balović was the second generation of honorary guards and the keepers of the doge's standard on the Venetian flagship, which was also the position held by his father Matija. For his merits Balović has received a numerous diplomas and gratitude letters from different Venetian authorities. His sailing career lasted until 1718.    While he was in Venetian quarantine in 1692 Balović transcribed Danica authored by Junije Palmotić. He amended his transcription with three poems of unknown authors, including ""Blind man sings of love events"" (Serbo-Croatian: Slijepac pjeva zgode koje ljubav nosi) and completed it on 16 February 1692.In 1693 Balović wrote an Italian language manuscript Pratichae Schrivaneschae which contains a manual for scribes on ships. Two different versions were written. The shorter version, written in 1693, is preserved in the archive of Archbishopric of Perast. This manuscript contains calligraphic inscription of different alphabets including Latin, Cyrillic (Serviano) and glagolitic (Slavo Illirico) and  a multilingual dictionary of the most often used words in everydays life on Italian (478), Slavo-Illirico (468), Greek (241), Albanian (201) and Turkish language(83). The longer version, without dictionary, was written in 1695 and is preserved in the Institute for Scientific and Artistic Work in Split.At the end of 1714 Balović began writing the Perast Chronicle, a collection of epic poetry which describes historical events related to Perast in the period between 1511 and 1716. Although this manuscript has been a subject of the significant scientific interest, it was never printed as a whole. It is assumed that Balović might be an author of one manuscript with transcriptions of official records and other documents, drawings of ships, short descriptions and legends related to events or ships drawn in this manuscript.    Balović's works include:  Danica (1692) – transcription of Palmotić's work with three poems Pratichae Schrivaneschae (1693) Pratichae Schrivaneschae (1695) Perast Chronicle (1714–?)   "
"Juraj Baraković (1548 – August 1, 1628) was a Croatian Renaissance poet from Zadar. [SEP] Baraković was born in the village of Plemići, Rtina.  He wrote several distinguished pieces (""Jarula"", Venice 1618 - Old and New Testament in storytelled form; ""Draga, rapska pastirica""), but one work excels in his literary opus: complicated and the most explicitly manneristic epic in 13 books ""Vila slovinka"" (Venice, 1613). Most of Baraković's poetry was dedicated to the glory of Zadar, with firm reliance on his co-citizen Petar Zoranić that already left a notable mark on Croatian literature. ""Vila slovinka"", an epic written in the glory of Zadar, has two especially notable features: in the eighth book the eleven octosyllabic sonnets are listed, which are, beside a few anonymously written ones in Ranjina's Miscellany, the only sonnets in Croatian poetry before the Illyrian movement. The same book contains perfectly stylised bugarščica about Mother Margarita, which astonishes both readers and philologists for centuries, still leaving to be determined whether is it a folk song that Baraković incorporated into his own work following the model of Petar Hektorović, or is it his own song adapted to the stylistic features of the folk poem stanzas, or the folk song enhanced by Baraković's skillful poetical and artistic genius.

"Petar Šimun ""Šime"" Budinić Zadranin (Latin: Piersimeone Budineo) (1535 – 13 December 1600) was a 16th-century Venetian-Croatian Catholic priest and writer from Zadar, Venetian Dalmatia (today Croatia). He was a translator of psalms and catechetical texts, promoter of post-Tridentine Catholicism, and a poet. [SEP]    Budinić was born in Zadar in the period between 1530 and 1535 in a family that originated from the Zadar hinterland. His father was a goldsmith whose name was Mihovil and his mother Klara was from the De Sanctis family. He was most likely educated by the Franciscans from Zadar, and knew both the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts well. It is assumed that he completed elementary and humanist education in Zadar, and higher education in Padua.Budinić became a Catholic priest in Zadar and advanced to the position of canon in 1560. Scholars disagree whether or not Budinić attended the Council of Trent. For many years Budinić was a notary in Zadar and chancellor in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zadar. As chancellor he wrote official documents using the Glagolitic script. While Budinić was a notary he had a lot of spare time which he used to read love songs. He is first mentioned in documents in 1556. Between 1559 and 1561 he wrote verses of love songs in dodecasyllable, seven of them still preserved, some of them in honor of Pelegrinović's Jeđupka. At that time he also authored one short Latin language satire which subject were cheated husbands.Budinić was a light-headed young priest who was even temporary expelled from Catholicism because of his misconduct, after he was reported for beating one of his fellow priests who swore his parents. Thanks to the influence of his family, this excommunication was abolished without endangering the advance in his career. In 1570 Budinić was appointed as chaplain of the Chapel of Saint Lucia on the island Pag and in 1577 he became chief vicar of the Archdiocese of Zadar.    In June 1581, Budinić travelled to Rome at the invitation of the Holy See to promote counter-reformation policy. According to one 1626 letter, Pope Gregory XIII invited Budinić to Rome to translate Catichesis of Peter Canisius to Illyrian language using Illyrian characters. Pope Gregory XIII ordered Budinić to prepare Roman Catholic Catechism using Illyrian language and characters. It is unclear if Pope ordered any particular script. Although it is confirmed by many contemporary documents that Pope indeed ordered Budinić to prepare Roman Catholic Catechism using Illyrian language and characters it remain unclear if Pope ordered any particular script. When Budinić arrived to Rome he became a confessor in Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome where he worked on improvement of the Glagolitic missals and breviaries.During his stay in Rome Budinić wrote his first two books on the pure Croatian language of the Chakavian dialect. According to one 1581 Vatican document, Budinić was preparing a translation in the Serbian language (Latin: nella lingua serviana), which at that time in the Vatican and Dubrovnik was a term used for Cyrillic script, the preferred language for Vatican documents to be published regarding Slavic language.    Budinić's intention was, from reasons of propaganda, to employ language and orthography that could penetrate and be understood in all of what was then the southern reaches of the Slavic people. Budinić attempted a daring orthographic reform and authored a version of the Latin script based on the Cyrillic and Glagolitic scripts, using diacritics (namely č and ž) from the Czech orthography of Jan Hus in his 1582 work. Some authors believed that Budinić, being promoter of Counter-Reformation, would never use orthography of Jan Hus who was a key predecessor to the Protestant Reformation.Under the influence of Jesuit priest Peter Canisius, Budinić abandoned the language he had been using in his 1582 work, and instead used a mixture of the Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian, Church Slavonic, Czech, and Polish languages. Budinić referred to the language of his work as Slavonic. Budinić then published translations of Canisius' work in 1583 (Summa nauk Kristjanski) in two versions, Cyrillic and Latin, and created a complex script based on Ijekavian Shtokavian pronunciation. The Latin script edition was published for clergy while Cyrillic script edition was published for population. Budinić published Cyrillic script edition with intention to spread this kind of book among South Slavs who were adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church.    Budinić died in Zadar on 13 December 1600, around the age of 65. The elementary school in Zadar bears Budinić's name. A square in Zadar was named Šime Budinić´s Square (Croatian: Poljana Šime Budinića).    Bibliography of Budinić's works include:  His own works: Love songs written in dodecasyllable, seven of them still preserved, including verses in honor of Pelegrinović's Jeđupka, Zadar, 1559-1561 Short satire which subject were cheated husbands, Latin language, Zadar, 1559-1561 Translations:Katekizam rimski (The Roman Catechism).

"Vicko Bujović (1660 – May 6, 1709) was a Venetian military commander and captain of Perast. [SEP]    During the Morean War, Bujović took command of the forces of Perast, offering their services, in his own name and that of the people of the city, to the Republic of Venice, with whom he was deeply connected.  The Venetians rewarded him well, enabling him to keep living in luxury; he built a palace and maintained a personal guard.  In 1695 he assisted in an attack on Trebinje, and fought as well against north African pirates.  Between 1694 and 1708 he was repeatedly elected a leader of the town.  His palace was finished in 1694; on March 28, 1704, he was made a duke. Bujović provoked a quarrel with the Zmajević family, prominent locally, when he fled to Dubrovnik with the daughter of an Ottoman agha and had a child with her out of wedlock, who had been committed to the care of Krsto Zmajević; he spent several years in that town before returning to Perast. During her stay in Dubrovnik Agha's daughter converted to Catholicism and took the name Jela. The two later got married, their best man being notable painter Tripo Kokolja. On May 6, 1709, Vicko was provoked into and killed in a street fight by a member of the Stukanović family.  For his involvement in the fight, Matija Zmajević was forced to leave Perast, eventually taking up service with the Russian Empire.   "
"Nikodim Busović (Serbian Cyrillic:  ; 27 December 1657 – 20 December 1707) was the Serbian Orthodox bishop of Krka (Eparchy of Dalmatia) in 1693–1705, the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Venetian Dalmatia. [SEP]    Born in Šibenik in Dalmatia (now in Croatia), Nikodim was the son of Dragosav and Todora. He had a brother, Đurđe, who was baptized in the Orthodox church in Šibenik in 1663. Nikodim was mentioned as a monk at the Krka Monastery already in 1676. He was chirotonized on 24 June 1693 as the bishop of Dalmatia by the Venetian Dalmatian bishop Melentije Tipaldi and a Greek archiereus from Corfu, thus, he was under the jurisdiction of the Philadelphian archbishopric seated in Venice.  The Serbian Orthodox leadership criticized him for accepting foreign chirotony, however, in 1696 Arsenije III Čarnojević recognized the chirotony due to Nikodim's resolute defense of Serbian Orthodoxy from Uniatism despite pressure, and improved church life, renovation of the Dragović Monastery (in 1694, deserted in 1614), and other efforts. He was titled the bishop ""of all Orthodox Serbs on the Dalmatian continent"", and also titled himself as ""bishop of Krka"". With the arrival of the new provvedittore of Dalmatia, Justinio Riva, pressure increased on Nikodim and Orthodox Serbs to subjugate to the Catholic bishop in Split.  The pressure led to a Serb rebellion in Dalmatia.  Because of this, Nikodim was banished from Dalmatia in early 1705 and forced to take refuge at Mount Athos.  In his place, the Venetian government appointed Savatije Ljubibratić, on the demand of the monasteries of Krka and Krupa. When the situation cooled down after a period of time, he returned to Dalmatia and died at the Krka Monastery.   "
"Petar Hektorović (1487 – March 13, 1572) was a Croatian writer.Hektorović, [SEP] also known as Pietro Ettoreo or Piero Hettoreo, was born and died in Stari Grad, Hvar.  He was a poet and collector of Hvar's fishermen songs, and an important figure of the Renaissance period in Croatian literature, and he also wrote in Latin and in Italian, language in which he wrote his testament.  His major work Fishing and Fishermen's Talk (Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje, 1568), is a hybrid genre: simultaneously a travelogue, discourse in fishing, reflexive poem and poetic epistle to his friend Jeronim Bartučević.  It is a treasure of Croatian maritime and zoological terminology, which has become incorporated in Croatian standard language. As hybrid as his major work, so was Hektorović's language: chiefly based on a local Čakavian dialect, but amalgamated with the idiom of Štokavian writing poets from Dubrovnik with whom Hektorović has remained in close contact during his lifetime.    The early music Ensemble Renaissance performs and has recorded a setting of his two songs as part of its ""Journey through Dalmatia"" program.   "

[SEP] After the defeat of the Rebellion, Ivanić became a symbol of freedom in Venetian-controlled Dalmatia, personifying defiance both against Venice and against the oppressive noble classes.

"Jakov of Kamena Reka (Macedonian:    , Serbian:    ; fl. 1564–72) or Jakov Krajkov ( , Bulgarian:  ) was a Venetian printer. [SEP] The information about his life is scarce. It is known he was from a former village called Kamena Reka or Stone River, according to him near the town of Kolasia, in Osogovo, Macedonia. It is assumed that the village could be Makedonska Kamenica in present-day North Macedonia, or Kamenichka Skakavitsa, in present-day Bulgaria, both placed in an area in Osogovo called Kamenitsa, near the town of Kyustendil. Also, in some works his birthplace is connected with Kamena Reka, near Kolasin in Herzegovina in today Montenegro. Nevertheless, that view is criticized as 19th century Šafárik's misinterpretation of the medieval name of Kyustendil (Kolasia) with that of the town of Kolasin, that was adopted afterwards by other researchers.  His family members had a long tradition of being Christian priests. In his youth Kraikov was a copyist of Church Slavonic books in the  Osogovo Monastery  ""St. Joakim Osogovski"".  Then he went to Sofia,  where in a local Church school, Kraikov deepened his literary knowledge. However some researchers maintain that Jakov of Sofia and Jakov of Kamena Reka are different historical persons. Afterwards, he set off through Kyustendil and Skopje to Venice. It is assumed that Kraikov worked on his way in Gračanica monastery where a printing press was opened. He was among the first printers of Cyrillic books. Kraikov reached Venice around 1564 or 1565 where he worked in the Vuković printing house, established by Božidar Vuković and inherited by his son Vićenco Vuković. In 1566 (in period of only three and a half months) he printed the Book of hours (Casoslov) of 710 pages on the printing press of Vićenco Vuković. It was printed in Serbian recension of the Church Slavonic language. To print this book Jakov used old, already worn out, sorts. He had at disposal Vuković's matrix and was prepared to cast new letters but he obviously failed to do it. This book is described in some sources as the first Bulgarian/Macedonian printed book.In 1570 Jakov worked in the printing press of Jerolim Zagurović where he printed a Prayer book. In 1571 Jakov again worked in Vuković printing house, where Stefan Marinović also worked before him. In 1597 this printing house was taken over by Italian printers (Bartolomeo Ginammi, Marco Ginammi, Giovanni Antonio Rampazetto, Francesco Rampazetto, Georgio Rampazetto, Camillo Zanetti) and its printing press was operational for additional 70 years.

"Pietro Canavelli (in Italian, his personal spelling; known as Petar Kanavelić in Croatian; 27 December 1637 – 16 January 1719) was a Croatian writer who wrote poems in Croatian and Italian. [SEP] He is regarded as one of the greatest Croatian writers of the 17th century.    Canavelli was born in Curzola (Korčula), part of the Republic of Venice (now modern Croatia), the last male descendant of an old, wealthy and distinguished noble family of the town. In Curzola he attended local schools. He undertook clerical studies. He also studied law in Padua. This was a quite common practice for the time for patricians from all over the Republic of Venice. He worked in a series of town offices, mostly in legal matters, trade and the management of property. He was also a teacher, lawyer and in 1665 became a member of the Great Council. In Zara (Zadar), he was Chancellor of the Venetian Governor General of Dalmatia, C. Cornaro and A. Priuli (1665–68). In 1673 he became the representative of the Curzola community in Venice. He died in Curzola in 1719.    Canavelli's literary work is one of the widest and most diverse in the 17th century. He wrote poems, epic works and songs in Croatian and Italian. He occasionally composed wedding songs. The oldest preserved traces of Canavelli's literary work was a written confirmation from 1660 for which he was paid 12 Lira for performing the song on the occasion of the arrival of General A. Cornaro, in the town of Curzola. This is one of the oldest recorded fee payments in the history of Croatian literature. During his stay in Zadar, Canavelli was in Spalato (Split) in 1667 and participated in the Italian comedy La moglie di Quattro Care  which was by Venetian librettist Giacinto Andrea Cicognini. He traveled throughout Dalmatia and the Republic of Ragusa. There he gained a status within the Ragusan community who were mostly the leading writers and intellectuals of their time (Nikola Bunic, Baro Bettera, Sisko Gundulic, George Lucic).

"Jerolim Kavanjin (Italian: Girolamo Cavagnini) (February 4, 1641 – November 29, 1714), was a Croatian language poet from Split then in Republic of Venice, today in Croatia. [SEP] He was born into a wealthy and noble family of Split, as a descendant of Croaticised Italian family of Cavagnini. Kavanjin rose to prominence at the same time as Ignjat Đurđević: at the beginning of the 18th century. He was married to the sister of John Peter Marchi. In 1703 Kavanjin became a member of the Illyrian Academy Marchi founded in 1703.In his summer mansion on Sutivan, on the island of Brač, where he retired after military and legislative career, Kavanjin wrote the most voluminas poetical work in the whole Croatian literature (approx. 32 500 verses): Poviest vanđelska bogatoga a nesretna Epuluna i ubogoga a čestita Lazara, usually referred to by the later editors, according to the subtitle in the original, as Bogatstvo i uboštvo. This religious-philosophical epic is poetically inconsistent but stylistically marked (it is written, beside Split Čakavian, in Ijekavian–Ikavian Štokavian). Expressing the spirit of philosophical movements of the 17th and 18th centuries, this ""encyclopædia in verses"" (Josip Aranza) directs its Baroque spirituality towards the cogitation on life and human essentiality in the dual nature of the human and the divine. Beside the classical humanistic, Latinate and Italian literatures (Dante), the Bible and other religious writings, and beside the historical authors (Constantine Porphyrogenitus, priest of Duklja, Mavro Orbini), writings of the Old Dubrovnik have constituted the basic Kavanjin's reading list, above others Junije Palmotić and Ivan Gundulić. Kavanjin identified with Slavs and Dalmatia, and John Fine interprets his pan-Slavism and Dalmatianism close to have been an ethnic notion.Kavanjin died in Split, aged 73.   "
"Aleksandar Komulović (1548 – 11 June 1608) was a Catholic priest and diplomat from Venetian Dalmatia (now Croatia). Part of the Counter-Reformation, and an early Pan-Slavist, he notably led a diplomatic mission aimed to forge an anti-Ottoman coalition in support of the West during the Long Turkish War, principally in the Balkans and among the Slavs. [SEP] Although he failed his mission, he inspired the Serbs to revolt. The Papacy was aware that the Latin language of the liturgical books presented an obstacle for the conversion of the South Slavs from Islam and Orthodoxy to Catholicism. Komulović belonged to the first group of Jesuit missionaries and authors who attempted to spread Catholicism among the Slavs using liturgical books in Slavic. After his death, his propaganda activities were continued by Bartol Kašić.    Komulović was born into a patrician family which was referred to in Papal and Venetian documents as Comolis or Comulis in Split, in Venetian Dalmatia (today Croatia). He finished high school, probably in Italy. Komulović was familiar with the Church Slavonic language and the Glagolitic script. He was married with a woman from Dubrovnik.    In 1576 Komulović became a member of the Society of Saint Jerome in Rome. In 1579 he was excluded from the Society because he was accused of activities against the order. He was in the service of Cardinal Iullus Antonius Santor and wrote a Slavic-language catechism, which he attempted to get printed in autumn 1579.In 1582 he was again accepted into the Order of Saint Jerome because it was shown that the accusations against him were unjustified. In the same year the Society financed the publishing of Komulović's work Christian Doctrine for the Slavic People in Their Own Language (""Nauch Charstianschiza Slovignschi narod, v vlaasti iazich"" or Italian: Dottrina Christiana per la nation Illirica nella propria lingua). This work established Komulović's reputation, especially among the Catholics of the Ottoman Empire. In 1584 Komulović was canon in Zadar, and in the same year, as an abbot in Nin, became a rector of the Academy of Saint Jerome, formerly known as St. Jerome of the Slavs (Italian: San Girolamo degli ""Schiavoni"") or the Illyrian Academy. He was appointed as the first arch-priest of the Church of Saint Jerome, completed in 1589.     At the end of January 1593 a bishop from Hvar sent a letter to the Pope inviting him to send envoys to Russia to forge a united Christian coalition against the Ottomans. In the same year a similar proposal was sent to the Pope by Komulović himself. An anonymous report from 1593, attributed to Komulović by many scholars, lists predominantly Slavic regions that could be mobilized to fight the Ottomans: Herzegovina, Slavonia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Serbia, Moesia, Bosnia, Rascia, Požega and Temeşvar.In 1593–97 Komulović was a Papal diplomat engaged in forging a coalition of Slavs against the Ottoman Empire. This coalition was to include all Christian Slavs, including Orthodox Russia. Komulović believed that all Slavs are one nation who speak one language with different dialects. He also believed that Slavs should have only one religion, Catholicism. In 1594 Pope Clement VIII sent a secret diplomatic mission led by Komulović to forge a coalition against the Ottoman Empire. Komulović traveled via Venice, Trent, Innsbruck and Vienna to Alba Iulia. The purpose of this trip was to convince the Tsar of Russia, King of Poland (including Zaporozhian Cossacks), the Prince of Transylvania and Voivodes of Moldavia and Wallachia to join a western anti-Ottoman coalition. His aim was also to inspire Serbs to rise up against the Ottomans. According to some sources he continued his journey to Jakin, Hvar, Dubrovnik, Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Bulgaria and finally Moldavia.Komulović was instructed to first travel to Venice to establish contacts with Albanians. In Venice he stayed in the house of notable Thomasso Pelessa from Albania; it was agreed upon that as soon as the Vatican, Poland or Russia declared war on the Ottomans, the Albanian tribes were to revolt. The Popes instructions and several letters Komulović had sewed in a cushion. When he left Venice he made tremendous mistake and forgot the cushion leaving behind three letters written in lingua Serviana by the ""people of Albania"". The Venetian authorities got in possession of those letters and concluded they were forged by Komulović, which is also believed by modern Australian historian Zdenko Zlatar.In July 1594, an assembly was summoned in a monastery in Mat, by Albanian tribal chieftains, joined by some Venetian subjects, of whom Mark Gjin was elected their leader. In 1595 he visited Rome to receive the Pope's support.In Pope Clement VIII's instructions to Komulović, the Serbs were explicitly praised as brave, while the neighbouring Bulgarians were said to be unwilling to fight. It is possible that these instructions were composed by Komulović himself. Komulović and Giovanni Battista from Cres maintained extensive contacts with the Patriarchate of Peć. Another member of Komulović's mission was Thommaso Raggio (1531–1599), who returned to Italy in 1595 while Komulović stayed in the Balkans until 1597 and submitted a detailed report to the Pope upon his return. He travelled to Moscow and twice visited the court of the Russian emperor, in 1595 and in 1597, but failed to convince the Muscovites to accept his proposals.Komulović did not succeed in forming the anti-Ottoman coalition, as none of the countries accepted the Pope's invitation. Russia refused to participate using bad relation with Poland as justification. Still, the mission inspired a series of uprisings in Serb-populated territories, such as the Uprising in Banat and Uprising in Peć in 1594. In 1594 and 1595 Cossacks plundered Ottoman-held Moldavia and invaded Transylvania. The Himara Revolt broke out in Albania in 1596, but it was easily suppressed after the Venetians convinced some of the chieftains not to join the rebellion.According to some rumours, the Republic of Ragusa was ready to expel Komulović because the Ottomans offered them some benefits if they did. Ragusans were worried because of the anti-Ottoman actions of Ragusan Jesuits. In 1597 Komulović began his return journey and stopped in Prague to propose to Emperor Rudolf II to re-capture Klis, which had a year earlier been briefly captured by the Uskoks.     In 1603 Komulović published a translation of the Short Catechism written by Roberto Bellarmina in the South Slavic dialect of Čakavian (which however, was not suitable for Štokavian speakers, including those of Dubrovnik), the first of many translations he published. In period 1604–1608 Komulovic was  leader of the newly established jesuit society in Dubrovnik. The only allowance Komulović received in this period was modest income from the small abbey from Nin.Before he died in Dubrovnik in 1608, Komulović wrote a will in Italian in which he left his money to the Illyrian Academy in Rome to buy a printing press for publishing books in Croatian (lingua illirica). Jerolim Kavanjin praised Komulović for presenting Christian doctrine on Slavic language better than anyone prior.After Komulović's death, the Jesuit mission he led was temporarily cancelled. His propaganda activities were continued by Bartol Kašić, who was an even greater Pan-Slav than Komulović. Kašić was a censor and editor of Komulovićs work Zrcalo od Ispovijesti, published in 1606 and republished in Rome in 1616 and in Venice in 1664 and 1704.    Notable works of Aleksandar Komulović include: 1582 — Christian Doctrine for the Slavic People in Their Own Language (""Nauch Charstianschiza Slovignschi narod, v vlaasti iazich"" or Italian: Dottrina Christiana per la nation Illirica nella propria lingua) 1603 — Translation of Short Catechism written by Roberto Bellarmina 1606 — Zrcalo od ispovjesti, published in Venice, republished in Venice in 1704   "
"Krsto Zmajević (May 21, 1620—fl. 1688), also known as Krile, was a captain and merchant in his home-town of Perast. [SEP] He was the brother of Andrija Zmajević.    Zmajević was born in Perast, in the Bay of Kotor, at the time part of the Republic of Venice (now Montenegro) on the 3rd of May 1640. The Zmajević family hailed from Njeguši; when the last members of the Crnojević family left Principality of Zeta, Nikola Zmajević and his cousins Ivaniš and Vučeta moved to Kotor. Becoming appealed and somewhat wealthy, the family quickly converted from Orthodoxy in favor of Roman Catholicism, with the three marrying Catholic girls and having their children baptized in the Latin Rite. Andrija's father was Nikola Milutin Zmajević. After Andrija's birth in 1628, soon came Andrija's brothers, Ivan and Krsto. Krsto Zmajević would become a very famous person, on more than one occasion as the Captain of Perast. Andrija remained very akin towards his family origin throughout his life. In 1671 he was elected the town captain of Perast, entrusted with military and administrative authority of the town. In 1675, he was sent to expel the pirates in Ulcinj who had sacked throughout the Adriatic Sea, for which he was awarded a golden necklace by the Senate.He became the caretaker of an Ottoman general's daughter, which later became the cause of the Zmajević-Bujović family feud. In 1679 he was elected town captain for the second time, in a period when Perast saw an expansion in defence against the Ottomans and pirates.

"Dimitrije Ljubavić (Venice, January 1519 – Brașov, 1564)) was a Serbian Orthodox deacon, humanist, writer and printer who together with German reformer Philip Melanchthon initiated the first formal contact between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Lutherans in 1559 when Ljubavić took a copy of the Augsburg Confession to Patriarch Joasaph II of Constantinople. [SEP] He is also referred to as Demetrios Mysos or Demetrius Mysos (also Demetrius of Thessalonica) in Lutheran and other Western books.    He came from a distinguished family of early printers, scholars, diplomats, and humanists. He is best known as the founder of the second printing press in Târgoviște in Wallachia in 1545. He had many apprentices, among whom were Romanian deacon Coresi,  the Serbian monks Mojsije Dečanac, Petar, and Opar (Oprea). The Lutheran leader Philip Melanchthon entrusted him with a letter addressed to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople to join forces against the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottomans, but all came to naught.The House of Ljubavić is a great example of how printing became a family enterprise. Božidar Ljubavić (1460-1527) was the head of a printing dynasty from the city and municipality of Goražde in the Serbian land of Bosnia-Hercegovina just at the time when the Turkish invasions had taken place. He was best known for printing textbooks and biblical material in Church Slavonic, Greek and Latin for the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Lutherans during the Reformation. Dimitrije's grandfather was Serbian printer Božidar Ljubavić, who is better known as Božidar Goraždanin. In 1518, Božidar Ljubavić sent his sons, Đurađ and hieromonk Teodor, to Božidar Vuković in Venice to learn the art of printing before purchasing a printing press for Gorazde. The Ljubavić brothers procured a press and began printing a hieratikon (priest's service book), copies of which had been completed by 2 October 1519 either in Venice or at the Church of Saint George, built by Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, near Goražde. After Đurađ Ljubavić died in Gorazde on March 1519, it is unclear whether his brother transported the press to Goražde before or after finishing the work on the hieratikon. Because members of Ljubavić family were from Goražde, they brought the printing press to their hometown. At the Church of Saint George, Đurađ and Teodor organized the Goražde printing house, which produced, beside the hieratikon, two more books in Church Slavonic of the Serbian recension: a Psalter in 1521, and a small euchologion in 1523. Books were printed by Božidar's grandson Dimitrije after being edited by hieromonk Teodor, his uncle.    When his father died on 12 March 1519, Dimitrije was taken by his mother from Venice to the Kingdom of Candia (Crete), then under Venetian rule. When still young he came to Chios, where he was taught Old Greek and Latin. He also received an extensive religious education while at the Academy of ""Janus Lascaris"" becoming initiated in the questions of Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic theology. There he met Iacob Heraclid, who pretended to be the legitimate heir of Serbian despots and prince in exile of Samos and Paros. Heraclid was a picturesque person of dubious origin, cousin of another Greek adventurer by the name of James Diassorin. (As fate would have it, Dimitrije would meet up with Heraclid many years later, then known as Despot Voda, who single-handedly attempted to impose the Reformation in the heart of Eastern Europe after becoming a self-styled despot of Romania from 1561 to 1563). After completing his studies at the Lascaris academy, Dimitrije joined hieromonk Teodor Ljubavić, his uncle in Venice, where he learned the family's printing trade.    In 1544, the printing press was transported from Goražde to Târgoviște, the capital of Wallachia, thus becoming the second such facility in the territory of present-day Romania. Its relocation (and reactivation) was accomplished by Dimitrije Ljubavić, Božidar's grandson, who brought with him Hierodeacon Mojsije. In Târgoviște, Dimitrije printed a euchologion at the beginning of 1545, and an apostolarium in 1547. This was all done under the auspices of Serbian-born Metropolitan Anania of Wallachia at the time.    After Dimitrije Ljubavić and his apprentices Opar and Petar completed printing  ""Apostol"" in Targoviste in 1547, Dimitrije left for Constantinople, where he printed books for the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople for the next three years. From there he went to Mount Athos and printed more books at Hilandar and other island monasteries such as Docheiariou, Osiou Gregoriou monastery, Agiou Pavlou monastery, Dionysiou Monastery, Zograf monastery, and Koutloumousiou for more than two years. On his return to Transylvania in 1552, Dimitrije Ljubavić not only took up responsibility for running a school in Brasov but also worked as a writer, printer, publisher, and illustrator of books. He also became a member of the town council. He continued to cultivate his humanist network of connections with the Lutherans and his own Orthodox faithful, preserving his good relations with leading figures at the residence of Metropolitan Anania (Branković) of Ungaro-Wallachia, who reigned as hierarch from 1544 to 1558. Ljubavić also helped Valentin Wagner compile and publish an Orthodox Catechesis in 1556. The town's judge, Johannes Benkner, and Johannes Honter's political patron before he died in 1549, also supported attempts to print text using the Cyrillic alphabet, and books were subsequently printed in both in Slavonic-Serbian and in Romanian. In 1556 a Church Slavonic printing press was established by Saxons Protestants in Şcheii Braşovului, a neighborhood of Brasov, where books were printed in Serbian (Slavonic) and Romanian in Cyrillic font. It was here that the new press printed Octotechos by Oprea, one of Ljubavić's early apprentices, along with Romanian deacon Coresi.    The spreading of the Reformation in Europe during the 16th century did not avoid the territory of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia (now all three part of Romania). Reformation ideas arrived in Wallachia from Hungary, Germany, Venice, Carniola, and Carinthia. German noblemen, clerks and military officers also played an important role in spreading the ideas of the Reformation at the grassroots level.  Wallachia was in a very difficult situation in the 16th century. Most of the provinces were under Turkish occupation and all efforts were focused on defending the country. As a result, the Turks played a role in allowing the changes of the Reformation to take hold in most parts of Transylvania, including Brasov and Târgoviște. In spite of a large number of renowned Protestant intellectuals who came from other lands, Protestantism did not have a profound impact on the people in Wallachia, only for that moment in time. It would seem that the reform movement as understood by Dimitrije Ljubavić and his contemporaries was in the broadest sense—catholic/universal—a trend happening in Western and now Eastern Europe. His relations with the Protestant group of Urach, led by Hans von Ungnad, in 1561, for a possible printing of Protestant books in Church Slavonic (Serbian recension) may constitute a partial chapter because it is an aborted business, but whose importance for the history of the reforms among the Serbs and Romanians is nevertheless indisputable.Well-aware that the newly established South Slavic Bible Institute needed the collaboration of some Orthodox in the translation of Protestant literature, Primož Trubar and Stjepan Konzul Istranin engaged Matija Popović and Jovan Maleševac for some time in Urach. But they were very disappointed when the plan to bring to Tübingen Dimitrije Ljubavić could not be realized. Possibly for the same reasons that his countryman Matthias Flacius was prevented from joining the press at Urach, near Tübingen. At this time, Dimitrije Ljubavić was the first secretary to the voivode of Wallachia Alexandru Lăpuşneanu and then spent more than three years at the Patriarchate of Constantinople as a deacon supervising the printing of books. After having probably become acquainted in Transylvania with Peter Petrovics, one of Temesvar's most influential magnates and a fervent supporter of the Reformation, he left for northern Hungary, where in Eperjes (Presov, Slovakia) he visits the governor of the city, Sigismund Tordai-Gelous (1518-1569). There, armed with a letter of introduction from Tordai-Gelous, Ljubavić leaves Presov in May 1559 for Wittenberg, where he met David Chytraeus and his teacher Philip Melanchthon and become familiar with the Augsburg Confession in a Greek version. Melanchthon drafted a letter for Patriarch Joasaph II of Constantinople which Dimitrije translated into Greek which read as follows: ""I send you a Greek Version of the 'Augsburg Confession', which was published without my advice. However, I approve the style and have sent it to Constantinople by a man of learning, a dean of that city, who has been our guest during the whole summer. He relates that there were many churches in Asia, in Thrace and the neighboring countries but they have been gradually diminished by oppression and bondage...."" The learned Orthodox Serb cleric, who was called Ućeni Srb, Dimitrije Serb (The learned Serb, Demetrius Serb), carried Melanchthon's letter to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople calling for a Lutheran-Orthodox ""unity of all true Christian communities."" There was no response from the Patriarch whatsoever. Dimitrije wrote to Melanchthon giving him an account of his journey to Constantinople dated October 15, 1559. For a short time, Dimitrije was able to work on this plan when a friend from the past, Iacob Heraclid, suddenly became ruler of Moldavia. Heraclid, while in exile in Germany, was won over by Melanchthon to the Reformation. The Reformation had a significant impact on Brasov. During the 16th century, Brasov was divided between Hungary and Turkey. As a result of the ambiguous political situation and the territorial division of the peninsula, the Reformation came here from three different directions: Venice, which was for a short while particularly favorable toward Reformation ideas; Wittenberg, where especially German merchants were very active; and from Carniola. Several Serbian printers remained loyal to the Serbian Orthodox Church, but they collaborated with the Lutherans and Calvinists to produce more books (with the advent of the printing press). That collaboration contributed to the spreading of the Reformation in Romania, Hungary, and Austria. Dimitrije Ljubavić, therefore, took part in assisting the Protestants to print catechisms in the Romanian and Serbian languages. Iacob Heraclid made Lutheranism the state Church, offending the native Eastern Orthodox who viewed him as an iconoclast due to his rhetoric against images, even though he did not, in fact, destroy any icons. This, together with Despot's decision to marry another foreigner (a Pole), new and increased taxes and the omnipotence of his foreign retinue led to a boyar conspiracy instigated by high dignitary Ștefan Tomșa. In the meantime, Heraclid's postponement of debt payments angered Albert Łaski. Faced with a large-scale rebellion, Heraclid retreated to the fortress in Suceava and withstood a three-month siege. At the end of it, Despot Voda was captured and was struck to death with a mace by Tomșa himself. So too, Dimitrije Ljubavić's fate was sealed when the previous monarch regained the throne and took revenge on Ljubavić for printing Protestant books, thinking that he had abandoned Orthodoxy for Protestantism. Dimitrije Ljubavić was eventually incarcerated and killed.

"Hanibal Lucić (Croatian pronunciation: [xǎnibal lûtsitɕ]) or Annibale Lucio (c. 1485 – 14 December 1553) was a Croatian Renaissance poet and playwright, author of the first secular drama in Croatian language. [SEP]    He was born to a Dalmatian noble family of Antun and Goja in Hvar, where he spent most of his life. Early in his youth, he was a judge and later became a lawyer of the Hvar municipality. As a witness of the Hvar Rebellion in 1510, he was forced to flee to Trogir and Split due to his disparaging stance towards the lower rebel peasantry. He referred to them as ""a bunch who have no thought"". His early literary work became associated with the translations of Ovid's work (Croatian:""iz latinske odiće svukavši u našu harvacku priobukal""). His writings are primarily recorded to be written in the Southern Čakavian dialect. He wrote drama (Robinja, the first secular-themed play in history of Croatian literature) and love poetry, under heavy influence of Francesco Petrarca, but the Croatian folklore is also included in his work. His admiration towards the feminine figure plays an important role in most of his poems. He was prone to self-criticism and had most of his work burned; the rest was salvaged and later published by his son Antonij.   "
"Johannes Lucius (Croatian: Ivan Lučić; Italian: Giovanni Lucio; September 1604 – 11 January 1679) was a Dalmatian historian, whose greatest work is De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae (""On the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Croatia""), which includes valuable historical sources, a bibliography and six historical maps. [SEP] Born in September 1640 in Trogir in a noble family, Lucius studied in Trogir and Rome, graduating philosophy, mathematics, political sciences and literature in 1628, and receiving Ph.D. in civil and canonical law in 1630. Following graduation, he worked as councilmen and judge in his hometown and developed intensive scientific-research work. His first book Vita B. Ioannis confessoris episcopi Traguriensis et eius miracula [Life of St. John the Confessor, Bishop of Trogir] (1657) is an important source of Croatian, and especially Dalmatian, history between 11th and 13th centuries. His capital work is De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae [On the Kingdom of Dalmatia and Croatia] (1662) in which he described the history of Dalmatia between the Roman times and 1480. The book contains the genealogy of Croatian dukes and kings and six historical Illyrian maps, regarded in Croatia as ""the first Croatian atlas"". The best known is map no. 6, Illyricum hodiernum [Present-day Illyricum], which Lucius dedicated to the Croatian ban Petar Zrinski, later included in Blaeu's Atlas Maior. In the book Memorie istoriche di Tragurio ora detto Traù [Historical testimonies about Trogir, now called Traù], he described the history of Trogir and Dalmatia to the mid 15th century. His book Inscriptiones Dalmaticae [Dalmatian Inscriptions] (1673) contains inscriptions and epigraphic monuments from Dalmatian heritage. In addition to his many other historical works, Lucius also engaged in archeology, geography, mathematics, physics, astronomy, construction and studying of ancient Christian monuments, Roman mosaics and inscriptions. He was a member of the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome in whose catacombs he was buried after his death in January 1679. Today, Lucius is widely regarded in Croatia as ""the father of modern Croatian historiography"".     Johannes was the son of Peter Lucius and Clara Difnico (Klara Divnić), born in Trogir, Venetian Dalmatia (now Croatia). After some schooling in his hometown, he went to Rome, where he spent two years, and then obtained his Ph.D. in ecclesiastical and civil law in the University of Padua. He returned to Trogir, and held various offices, but he returned to Rome in 1654. There he became a member of the Fraternity of Saint Jerome, and then its president. He participated in the work of many scientific academies of his age and wrote to scientists from Dalmatia, Italy and Europe. He wrote a number of historical works in Italian and Latin. His greatest and most famous work is De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae (The Kingdom of Dalmatia and Croatia). The book was published after the war of Candia, a critical moment for the Republic of Venice. In his book Lucius pointed out the difference between the Romance and Slavic Dalmatia, the habits of the people and the cultural borderlines. It was first printed in Amsterdam in 1666. This book provides an overview of both, the history of Dalmatia and history of Croatia, from the prehistory to the 15th century. While his predecessors and contemporaries used suppositions as much as facts, Lucius founded his estimates on genuine sources. At the end of the book, he included certain valuable historical sources and a bibliography with his comments. The book had six historical maps. One of maps, the historical map Illyricum hodiernum (today's Illyria) was dedicated by Joan Blaeu, Lucius' publisher to the Croatian ban Petar Zrinski. Since everyone was looking up to antiquity, the Zrinski believed their ancestors were Roman aristocrats. Lucius showed them that their roots reached back to the famous medieval dukes of Šubićs noble family from Bribir. Lucius participated in the dispute about the authenticity of the text of Trimalchio's Banquet by the Roman satirist Petronius, which had been found in Trogir. He also published the history of his home town in Memoriae istoriche di Tragurio, ora detto Trau (""Trogir in Historical Literature""; 1673). He also published a book of Roman inscriptions from Dalmatia, including the inscriptions collected by the famous Croatian poet and writer Marko Marulić. Shortly before his death, Lucius prepared the Statute of Trogir for printing. Lucius was never married. He resided in Rome until his death, and was buried there, in the Church of St. Jerome. A monument was erected to his memory in 1740.    Johannes Lucius was the first Dalmatian historian who critically examined and used historical sources: documents and chronicles, inscriptions and last wills. His historical methodology was far ahead of his time. He corresponded with many famous people from Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik), especially Stefano Gradi, the head of the Vatican Library. His numerous letters, revealing him as a man of integrity and a skillful writer are a valuable fresco of the conditions of his time. Lucius' work, written in a lapidary and clear style, based on critical considerations, is the cornerstone of the modern historiography about Dalmatia. Today in Croatia, Lucius is considered the father of modern contemporary Croatian historiography.   "
"Stefan Marinović (Serbian Cyrillic:  ; fl. 1561–63), also known as Stefan of Scutari (Stefan Skadranin) was a 16th-century Serb printer from Scutari (Shkodër).

Marinović built a printing house in Scutari in 1563. The second book he published was, according to its prologue, printed in Scutari. This book printed in Scutari was linked to the Venice issued by its style while its graphic was poor. It was printed on paper and had 224 pages.Marinović brought a skillful printer Camillo Zanetti with him to Scutari where he completed Triod by printing its remaining part (Serbian: Cvetni Triod). Because Marinović used similar typography as Vićenco Vuković some authors believe that there is a possibility that he actually did not print his last book in Scutari, but in Venice. Other authors explain that he used typography similar to Vuković's simply because he liked it and ordered similar one to be made for his book printed in Scutari.Marinović was chronologically the third publisher of Cyrillic books in Venice.

"Marko Marulić Splićanin (Croatian pronunciation: [mâːrko mǎrulitɕ]), in Latin Marcus Marulus Spalatensis and Italian Marco Marulo (18 August 1450 – 5 January 1524), was a Croatian poet and Renaissance humanist. [SEP] He coined the term ""psychology"".He is regarded as the Croatian national poet and has been called the ""crown of the Croatian medieval age"" and the ""father of the Croatian Renaissance"".    Marulić was a nobleman born in Split, Dalmatia, coming from the distinguished aristocratic family of Pečenić (Pecinić, Picinić), Pezzeni in Italian, the 15th century family branch whose founder was Petar, and only began calling themselves again Marulić, Marulus or  De Marulis, in the 16th century.Very little is actually known about his life, and the few facts that have survived to this day are fairly unreliable. It is certain that he attended a school run by a humanist scholar Tideo Acciarini in his hometown. Having completed it, he is then speculated to have graduated law at the Padua University, after which he spent much of his life in his home town. Occasionally he visited Venice (to trade) and Rome (to celebrate the year 1500). He lived for about two years in Nečujam on the island of Šolta. In Split, Marulić practised law, serving as a judge, examinator of notarial entries and executor of wills. Owing to his work, he became the most distinguished person of the humanist circle in Split.    The central figure of the humanist circle in Split, Marulić was inspired by the Bible, Antique writers and Christian hagiographies. Main topics of his writings were Christian theological by nature. He was a poet and writer who wrote many poems, discussions on theology and Christian ethics, stories and some epics. He wrote in three languages: Latin (more than 80% of his preserved opus), Croatian and Vulgar Italian (three letters and two sonnets are preserved). Marulić was active in the struggles against the Ottoman Turks who were invading the Croatian lands at that time. He wrote, among other works, an Epistola to the Pope where he begged for assistance in the fight against the Ottomans.   "

"Vinko Pribojević (Latin: Vincentius Priboevius mid-15th century – after 1532) was a Venetian Slavic historian and ideologue, best known as one of the founders of the early pan-Slavic ideology. [SEP]    Pribojević was born on the island of Hvar, in Venetian Dalmatia (now Croatia). American historian John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr. emphasizes that Pribojević and Juraj Šižgorić did not consider themselves to be Croats, but rather Slavic language-speaking Venetians. Pribojević alone considered himself Dalmatian first and foremost and then Slavic, shunning the Venetian tag later in his life. He was educated in the humanist spirit and joined the Dominican Order around 1522. His most famous work is the speech De origine successibusque Slavorum (On the Origin and Glory of the Slavs), where he exalts Illyrians and Slavs as the ancestors of the Dalmatian Slavs. His speech, most probably made in Venice in 1525, left a deep impression on the Venetians, who published it in Latin and Italian several times over the following years. Its passionate glorification of Slavs (in which the book includes Alexander the Great and Aristotle, Diocletian and Jerome) and its strong pathos played a major role in the birth of the pan-Slavic ideology. It was the first time that such ideology was formulated as a program, which was further developed by Mavro Orbini and Juraj Križanić.    Pribojević was the first to incorporate Illyrians and their myth into the Croatian and Slavic historiography (or rather ideology), as a shield and rampart against the German, Hungarian and Italian national and territorial ambitions. His identification of Slavs as Illyrians, as well as his enthusiastic glorification of the historical greatness and importance of Illyrians, left a deep mark on world history and outlook. In particular, in accordance with the humanist approach of the Rennaissance that combined scripture with ancient myth, Pribojević claimed that the paleo-Balkanic populations such as the Illyrians, Thracians and Macedonians were of a Slavic character. Furthermore according to Pribojević, Alexander the Great, multiple Caesars and Saint Jerome were Slavs.He was one of the most important Croatian and global Latinists who created the ideological molds of the future, is also the ancestor of the Croatian Illyrian movement of the 19th century and of the pan-Slavic ideology that was embraced by all Slavic peoples.

"Smiljanić (Smogianich) were a Croatian or Vlachian family originating from Lika and first mentioned in the 17th century, when the oldest member Petar Smiljanić was a harambaša and capo (head) of the Morlach troops in Venetian service during the Cretan War (1645–69), in Venetian Dalmatia. [SEP] He was born in Udbina, in the Lika region, then moved with his family to Venetian Dalmatia (Ravni Kotari) in 1647. From the family originated nine serdars, who participated in the Cretan War (1645–69) and Morean War (1684–1699).    It is considered that the family is related to noble officer family Smoljan/Smoglian from Senj, recorded in the mid-16th century and serving military positions in the military units of Lika and Gacka. Petar Smiljanić was titled as capo (principale), and after arrival was included in the troops of commander Bosichi Renesi, and was noted for orderly holding his horse and weapons. Already in first battles with Ottoman forces, he became distinguished. He was instrumental in the takeover of Zemunik, Novigrad, Obrovac, Nadin and Vrana. Petar also led the attack on Gračac in Lika in 1647. First major intrusion into Turkish Croatia was in 1648 in the area of Unac, and soon Leonardo Foscolo named his commander of all forces in North Dalmatia. In July of the same year, he participated in the exhausting campaign led by count Frane Posedarski against fort Ribnik in Lika, where he died alongside Stipan Sorić. He had four sons, who had prominent roles in the Venetian-Ottoman wars, and who also died in the war against Ottomans; Ilija (1654), Filip (1656), Smiljan or Mate (1687), and Ivan or Marko (1693). After the extinction of the male line, the family spread on the female line; the sons of Petar's daughter Anka and certain Mihaljević - Smoljan, Marko, and Šimun, took mother's surname and continued the family tradition of warfare against the Ottomans.In 1653 is mentioned his son, serdar Ilija Smiljanić, as governator principale of the Morlach troops and of all harambašas. The title of serdar is mentioned for the first time in Venetian official documents in 1656, when provveditore Zen instead of killed Filip Smiljanić placed Janko Mitrović for supreme serdar. Ilija was the most prominent member of the family, on the lead of uskoks from Lika and Ravni Kotari. He participated with c. 250-350 Morlachs (Uskoks) from Ravni Kotari in the conflict near Zečevo, on 31 July 1648, where died renowned Vuk Mandušić. With his troops he also defeated Ottomans in battles near Zvonigrad and Bilaj (1649), Korlati (1651), Ostrovica (1652), and Udbina and Livno (1653). He was noted for bravery during the raid in Lika, where died.In 1686, Smiljan couldn't join Šimun Bortulačić and Stojan Janković in Sinj and Knin because was sick in the bed, and mortal danger due to podagra on his neck. At the end of summer 1686, Smoljan Smiljanić and Stojan Janković went on a big raid in the countryside of Livno due to rumours of vast Ottoman troops invasion, led by pasha Bastić and Ali-beg Filipović, with the intention to rebuild the land and fortifications. In the raid many houses and goods vanished, also there were many human casualties, with Janković and Smiljanić noting on 7 September that the whole valley of Livno within 50 miles (80.4 km) became desolated.They were a very reputable family of good warriors and soldiers, steadily with reputation moving away from the common people and entered the Venetian nobility. Already in 1653 Venice donated a house in Zadar to Ilija Smiljanić. In the same year, Filip Smiljanić became the captain of the armoured troops of light cavalry, which was a big recognition. Serdar Smoljan Smiljanić, who succeeded Ilija, was gifted with 30 ducats monthly, chain of 100 ducats, scarlet dolman and so on. Smiljan Smiljanić received 10 ducats monthly. Since the earliest church documents from Zadar they were of Catholic and never of the Orthodox faith. It is considered that, roughly, members of the Smiljanić family were the leaders of Catholic Morlachs, while from Mitrović-Janković of the Orthodox Morlachs. The progeny of the female line, Lazar received citizen status of Zadar in 1703, Lazar and priest Franjo or Frane received in 1793 entered the nobility from Nin, and 1796 from Zadar. Son of Lazar, Antun, was a member of both noble councils. In 1822 Austrian authorities confirmed noble title only to Antun Ivan, by whose death in 1832 century the family became extinct.    Petar and Ilija Smiljanić were characters in Croatian epic poetry and were mentioned by Andrija Kačić Miošić in poem Od vitezova dalmatinskih: I pogibe Petre Smiljaniću  Na Krajini od Udbinom gradom:  Pogubi ga junak od Krajine,  Po imenu Ograšević Mujo  ...

He commanded a mercenary unit numbering 500 men largely recruited from Dalmatia. [SEP] During the 1470 Ottoman siege of Venetian Negroponte the Venetians uncovered that he had sent envoys to the Ottomans; a deep conspiracy was unearthed and Schiavo's associates were arrested.

"Giuseppe Viscovich, also Josip Visković, was a Venetian count.

On August 23, 1797, the citizens of Perast gathered to bury the flag of the Republic under the altar of the cathedral, to prevent it falling into enemy hands. Before the kneeling crowd, Viscovich delivered an emotional speech, the Discorso de Perasto, still well known to Venetians. Contemporary chroniclers tell that Giuseppe said to his young grandson, present at the ceremony, ""You too kneel down, Annibale, and remember these words as long as you live."" Whilst Captain Viscovich's impassioned speech is often cited as an expression of the loyalty which many Croatian, Serbian and Montenegrin subjects of the Venetian Republic felt, uprisings did often occur against centuries-long Venetian rule in Dalmatia and the Montenegrin littoral.

His father's books were so popular that until 1561 Vićenco had only published reprints of his fathers books and successfully sold them. The reprints include   reprinted in 1560, based on the 1537 edition.In 1561 Stefan Marinović printed his first book in printing house of Vićenco Vuković.

"Jerolim Zagurović ((Serbian:  ), Italian: Girolamo Zagurovich) (c. 1550—1580) was a Serbian-Venetian printer of Serbian Cyrillic books (srbulje). Zagurović and Vićenco Vuković were the last printers of srbulje books. [SEP]    Zagurović was Serbian Catholic and member of the noble Zagurović family from Kotor, Republic of Venice (today Montenegro). His paternal uncle was distinguished poet Ilija Zagurović.The Zagurović family was related to the Serbian Crnojević family through the marriage of Jerolim Zagurović and Antonija Crnojević, the daughter of Lord Đurađ Crnojević of Zeta (r. 1489–96). They had a son, Anđelo, who lived in Venice.    The Crnojević printing house was disestablished when Đurađ Crnojević fled Zeta in 1496. The types used in his printing house remained in the monastery until Jerolim Zagurović found them somewhere before 1569. He wrote that he took some types to Venice. Because Jerolim insisted he brought types from Crnojević printing house to Venice, it was speculated that he had actually used Crnojević's types in his printing house. This was disputed by some later works which explained that the Crnojević printing house was so well reputed that other printing houses imitated its types.In 1569 he founded a printing house in Venice and began printing Cyrillic books. One of the motives of Jerolim Zagurović to establish the printing house was to earn some profit from it to compensate losses of the Zagurović family business caused by frequent Ottoman sieges of Kotor. Zagurović did not have a formal theological education so he had to engage Jakov of Kamena Reka to edit and proofread the texts before printing. (Jakov belonged to the Serbian Orthodox Church).In 1569 he printed a psalter and in 1570 a prayer book. This was the last Serbian Cyrillic book printed until the second half of the 18th century. There was only one book printed in 1638 in Venice by Bartholomew Ginami, but it was simply a reprint of the psalter with the book of hours published by Zagurović in 1569.

"Andrija Zmajević (Perast, Republic of Venice, now Montenegro, 6 June 1628 - 7 September 1694) was a Baroque poet, the Archbishop of Antivari and a theologian. [SEP]    Zmajević was born in Perast, in the Bay of Kotor, at the time part of the Republic of Venice (now Montenegro) in late July 1628. The Zmajević family hailed from Njeguši; when the last members of the Crnojević family left Principality of Zeta, Nikola Zmajević and his cousins Ivaniš and Vučeta moved to Kotor. Becoming appealed and somewhat wealthy, the family quickly converted from Christian Orthodoxy in favor of Roman Catholicism, with the three marrying Catholic girls and having their children baptized in the Latin Rite. Andrija's father was Nikola Milutin Zmajević. After Andrija's birth in 1628, soon came Andrija's brothers, Ivan and Krsto. Krsto Zmajević would become a very famous person, on more than one occasion as the Captain of Perast. Andrija remained very akin towards his family origin throughout his life. The Franciscans held an elementary school since 1638 in the private home of the Mazarović family. After attending this poor school for a short time, Andrija moved to Kotor to earn some better education. As the first man of the Congregation for Propaganda of Faith he travels to Rome to their Institution ""Urbino"", where he earned a PhD in Philosophy and Theology. Andrija quickly rose to prominence in Rome. In July 1651 at the request of Jeronim Pastrić of Split, he was accepted into the Brotherhood of Saint Geronimo along with eight other young priests, all of whom come from Dalmatia. Andrija begins his literal career there, as a student. When the ex-Swedish Queen Christine moved to Rome and paid an honorary visit to the College for Propagation of the Faith, Andrija was one of the 42 young students that dedicated poems and speeches to her in 26 different languages. On 15 April 1654 the Ottoman Turks from Herzegovina under the leadership of Mehmed-pasa Rizvanbegović assaulted Andrija's hometown Perast; his brother Krsto Zmajević heroically defended the city. Andrija wrote a poem Boj peraški (Battle of Perast) dedicated to celebrating this event. Some half a century ago the last remaining copy of this work was lost. He returned to his home and became the abbot of the local monastery of St. George and the pastor of Perast (1656). In 1664 he became the vicar of Budva bishopric and in 1671 the titular archbishop of Bar and primate of the Kingdom of Serbia. As both Bar and the rest of Montenegro were under Ottoman control, Zmajević resided in Perast where he built a grand palace called Biskupija (""Bishop's palace""). The palace was frescoed by his protégé, the talented local painter Tripo Kokolja. Biskupija also contained one of the most significant libraries in the eastern Adriatic. He also supervised the building of the high bell tower of the parish church and of many other churches round the Bay of Kotor (Boka kotorska). Zmajević was interested as well in classical antiquities and collected Roman inscriptions and ruins. Although a high Catholic prelate Zmajević remained very tolerant and highly esteemed by both the Catholics and the Orthodox, among the latter by Arsenije III Čarnojević, the Serbian patriarch, also of the Njeguš clan. During the Great Turkish War Pope Clement X, in making contact with the Serbian Orthodox Patriarch of Peč, Arsenije III Čarnojević, employed the offices of both the Serbian Vladika of Montenegro, Ruvim III Boljević and the Catholic Archbishop of Bar, Andrija Zmajević. He died in 1694 and was buried in the chapel by the palace that he erected.    He also collected epic and lyric folk songs and transcribed works of the poets of Dubrovnik, notably Gundulić. His only published work, the song ""Od pakla"" (""Hell"") saw the light of day in Venice in 1727. Almost all of his other works remained in manuscripts. He wrote: Hronika or Ljetopis crkveni (Church Annals or Church Chronicles) illustrated by himself and his countryman Tripo Kokolja. Svadja Lazarevih kćeri, Brankovice i Miloševice (""The Quarrel of Lazar’s daughters, wife of Branko and wife of Miloš"") Peraški boj (""The Battle of Perast""). Slovinskoj Dubravi (Of Slavic Dubrovnik"") Tripu Škuri (""Of Tripo Škura)Zmajević wrote both in Cyrillic and in Latin scripts.  Zmajević called the language in which he wrote ""Slavic"" (slovinski). He justified his decision to write in ""Serb letters"" (Cyrillic script) since ""the whole of our nation uses it"" (kojim se služi čitava naša nacija). His inspiration comes both from current events and from Serbian history and epic so that he often mentions Saint Sava, Nemanja, Miloš Obilić and other historical and legendary figures.   "
"Thomas the Archdeacon (Latin: Thomas Archidiaconus; Italian: Tommaso Arcidiacono; Croatian: Toma Arhiđakon; c. 1200 – 8 May 1268), also known as Thomas of Split (Latin: Thomas Spalatensis, Hungarian: Spalatói Tamás), was a Roman Catholic cleric, historian and chronicler from Split. [SEP] He is often referred to as one of the greatest sources in the historiography of Croatian lands.    What is known about Thomas' life comes from his work, Historia Salonitana. He speaks of his life in the third person and very briefly, in the style of medieval literature genres. Thomas was born in Split at the beginning of the 13th century. It is not known whether he was of noble or common birth, but he represented the elite Roman culture that had survived from before the Slav migration, and he had a negative view of Slavs, often mistakenly conflating them in his chronicle with the Goths. He was probably educated at the cathedral school in Split. Around 1222 he was sent to study at the University of Bologna. There he perfected skills (under, among others, Accursius) in law, rhetoric, gramathic and notary (ars dictandi and ars notaria). He saw Saint Francis of Assisi in Bologna, a remarkable event which he mentioned in his work, describing the person of Saint Francis. Upon returning to his hometown of Split he advanced fast in church hierarchy. He became notary official (ca. 1227), then (1230) the archdeacon (head of the body of canons). He described Mongol siege of Split of 1242, Mongol customs and homeland, thus creating the first ethnological writings in local historiography. In 1243 a body of canons chose Thomas to be archbishop of Split, however due to his views on Church autonomy in Split, commoners rebelled against him. Fearing for his life, he never occupied that function, and in the end resigned the honor. Because of that, in his work he wrote about future archbishops with bitterness. He died in Split on May 8, 1268. Today, his grave lies in the Church of St. Francis.    Thomas was a stern advocate of medieval commune movement in Split. He wrote about Croatian nobles (and Hungarian kings in his time) in the hinterland of the city with great animosity, because they tried to crush the autonomy of the city. And conversely, he treated fairly those who respected the commune autonomy (Croatian kings, and later, Hungarian kings in the 12th century). In 1239 he organized new („latin“) administration in Split, bringing Gargane de Ascindis from Ancona, as the new Podestà. He was also an advocate of Church autonomy within the city (in accordance with official Roman Church teaching) which excluded commoners and citizens from interfering in Church business (such as the election of the archbishop).    Thomas' only work is the Historia Salonitana, the history of the archbishops of Salona and Split written in Latin. The work itself is combining three medieval history genres – historia, chronica and memoriale. Eventually, his work outgrows the narrow theme of archbishops, and becomes an outstanding literary achievement which encompasses the whole of the Croatian medieval period up to the 13th century. Because of Thomas' original research in the archbisphoric's archive in Split, he brings facts and news from documents today unknown to contemporary historians. His work is therefore not only of great literally value, but also of historical value for Croatian history.   "
"Frang Bardhi (Latin: Franciscus Blancus, Italian: Francesco Bianchi, 1606–1643) was an Albanian Catholic bishop and writer. [SEP] Bardhi is best known as an author of the early eras of Albanian literature. He served as Bishop of Sapë (1635–1644).    Bardhi was born in Kallmet or Nënshat in the northern Albanian Zadrima region near Lezhë. He came from a family consisting of many figures high in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and state officials or military commanders of the Republic of Venice. His uncle was Bishop of Sapa and Sarda. He studied theology in Italy. On 17 December 1635, Francesco Bianchi was appointed during the papacy of Pope Urban VIII as Bishop of Sapë. On 30 March 1636, he was consecrated bishop by Ciriaco Rocci, Cardinal-Priest of San Salvatore in Lauro, with Giovanni Battista Altieri, Bishop Emeritus of Camerino, and Ottavio Broglia, Bishop of Asti, serving as co-consecrators.Bardhi is remembered as the author of the first Albanian dictionary Dictionarium latino-epiroticum (Latin-Albanian dictionary) published in Rome in 1635, comprising 5,640 entries. Its appendix contains a list of 113 proverbs, phrases, and idioms, some of which are translations from other languages into Albanian with the vast majority being collected from the Albanian folklore.Bardhi also wrote a biography of George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, called The Apology of Scanderbeg published in Venice in 1636. The Apology of Scanderbeg was a polemic against Slavic Catholic priest Ivan Tomko Mrnavić, who claimed that Kastrioti was of Slav origin. Bardhi also complained that the Albanian language ""was being lost and degenerating"" under the blows of foreign occupiers, and in order to preserve it he saw himself contributing to the missing of rising the national pride between Albanians.From 1637 on, Bardhi submitted reports in Italian and Latin to the Congregation of the Propaganda Fide in Rome which contain a mine of information about his diocese, about political developments, about Albanian customs and about the structure and position of the Catholic Church in Ottoman-occupied Albania.

"Francesco Antonio Bertucci (Croatian: Franjo Antun Brtučević, fl. 1595), was a Dalmatian Capuchin and Knight Hospitaller. of disputed origin who served as the titular prior of the commandry of the Order at the monastery located in Vrana, a town in present-day Croatia. He is known for his remarkably consistent efforts to turn Habsburg-Ottoman Long War into crusade of Christian alliance against the Ottomans.Originally from the town of Hvar, Bertucci was a relative of the Dalmatian poets Jerolim (Gerolamo) and Hortenzije Brtučević (Ortensio Bertucci). Bertucci was a member of the Holy League of Pope Clement VIII. In 1592 Bertucci was in Rome where he received Pope's order to catch and kill Marco Sciarra, the leader of rebels, which he did in April 1593.    Bertucci was at the heart of 1596 plans for the uprising in the eastern Adriatic region. According to some suggestions, the main reason for his anti-Ottoman activities were his plans to recapture the Priory of Vrana from Ottomans.The contemporary Venetian sources and later sources that rely on them considered Bertucci as papal agent, while some other sources simply considered him as an adventurer who managed to achieve access to the Pope through emperor Ferdinand II. Elisabeth Springer, an Austrian scholar who studied the career of Bertucci, emphasize that Bertucci's earlier attempts to access the pope (before he gained support of Ferdinand II) aimed to convince him to inspire general anti-Ottoman uprising in the Balkans and organize an anti-Ottoman crusade (Holy League), were not successful. Springer further concluded that Bertucci was actually an agent of Holy Roman Empire who initially gained support of Archduke Ferdinand of Graz and later emperor Ferdinand II and members of his court, for his anti-Ottoman plans. According to Bertuccis plan, the rebels (including Uskoks) would first capture Klis, Herceg Novi and Scutari from the Ottomans. That would trigger large Ottoman naval expedition into north Adriatic and draw Venetians, who otherwise refused to join the crusade, to join the alliance against the Ottomans.In the early 1590s the seat of anti-Ottoman conspiracy of Bertucci and his associates was in Ragusa. According to some rumours, the Republic of Ragusa was ready to expel them because the Ottomans offered them some benefits if they did. The seat of anti-Ottoman conspiracy was then moved to Split.In 1595 Bertucci tried to convince  the Metropolitan of Cetinje Rufim Njeguš to accept union with Catholic Church.    On 7 April 1596 a group of Uskoks who were Habsburg citizens and about thirty Venetian citizens attacked the Ottoman-held fortress of Klis (Battle of Klis (1596)) and captured it with the support of some members of the Ottoman garrison. [SEP] The Habsburgs and Papal State joint troops, led personally by Antonio Bertucci, were sent to reinforce weak Christian garrison in the newly captured fortress. The releaf troops were supplied from the port of Senj. The Ottoman forces first defeated reinforcement troops and then reoccupied Klis. The Habsburg general who was supposed to lead relief troops blamed Bertucci for this defeat. Bertucci was captured during this battle and briefly held in Ottoman captivity until he was ransomed. This defeat had negative influence to his further attempts to convince Balkan Christian rulers to rebel against the Ottomans.   "

Through Mahmut Bushati, Bizzi obtained a firman from Sultan Ahmed I, allowing him entry into Antivari. After obtaining the firman, Bizzi went off to live in the house of Asan Çelebi in Antivari. However, his life was always in danger. Because of unsettled conditions within his diocese, Bizzi had his seat in Budua, where he only lived for three years. In the beginning of 1610, Bizzi had set off on a journey to visit his ecclesiastical regions, which were under Turkish, only to return by the end of the year. He travelled to Rab the following year, eventually settling in Rome, in Italy, where he died. During his reign as Archbishop, he provided a detailed report of the Archbishopric, which would later become a widely used authentic historical source.On another note, his reign also saw many Buduan locals from the Paštrović tribe (pleme) converted to Roman Catholicism.

These include: Leonelo Chieregati, Bishop of Rab and Trogir; and Giovanni Chieregati, Bishop of Kotor.Originally from Vicenza, Pope Clement VII appointed Chieregati as Archbishop of Antivari on 11 May 1528. However, during Chieregati's pontificate in Antivari, he did not reside within the city. From 1530, Chieregati served as an administrator of the Diocese of Narnia. Because of his absence, the administration of the Archdiocese of Antivari was entrusted to Jacob, Bishop of Budua (and Bishop of Ulcinium). Dalmas had caused a stir within Ulcinium when he attempted to introduce ""new"" families into the small group of Ulcinium's aristocracy. On 29 July 1549, a letter arose written to the Venetian Inquisition by Chieregati from Vincenza. In it, he describes his support for the actions performed by his vicar in Antivari, although Chieregati never explicitly stated who his vicar was. In the letter, he also accused some of the clerics in Ulcinium of being inclined towards Protestantism, therefore labeling them as heretics. In 1541, Chieregati relocated to Antivari, formally regaining the administration of the archdiocese. Upon his relocation, he also illegally (not mandated by the Holy See) acted as the bishop of Budua. In 1546, he attended the Council of Trent where he requested the presence of his suffragans.

"Marco Antonio de Dominis (Croatian: Markantun de Dominis) (1560 – September 1624) was a Dalmatian ecclesiastic, archbishop of Split and Primate of Dalmatia and all Croatia, adjudged heretic of the Catholic Faith, and man of science.     He was born on the island of Rab (today part of Croatia), off the coast of Dalmatia, in a noble family of Dalmatian origin. Educated at the Illyrian College at Loreto and at the University of Padua, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1579 and taught mathematics, logic, and rhetoric at Padua and Brescia, Italy. He was educated by the Jesuits in their colleges at Loreto and Padua, and is supposed by some to have joined the Society; the more usual opinion, however, is that he was dissuaded from doing so by Cardinal Aldobrandini. For some time he was employed as a teacher at Verona, a professor of mathematics at Padua, and a professor of rhetoric and philosophy at Brescia.    In 1596 he was, through imperial influence, appointed Bishop of Senj (Segna, Seng) and Modruš in Croatia in August 1600, and transferred in November 1602 to the archiepiscopal see of Split. His endeavors to reform the church soon brought him into conflict with his suffragans; and the interference of the papal court with his rights as metropolitan, an attitude intensified by the quarrel between the Papacy and Venice, made his position intolerable. This, at any rate, is the account given in his own apology, the Consilium profectionis in which he also states that it was these troubles that led him to those researches into ecclesiastical law, church history, and dogmatic theology, which, while confirming him in his love for the ideal of the true Catholic Church, convinced him that the papal system was far from approximating to it.He sided with Venice, in whose territory his diocese was situated, during the quarrel between Pope Paul V and the Republic (1606–7). That fact, combined with a correspondence with Paolo Sarpi and conflicts with his clergy and fellow bishops, which culminated in the loss of an important financial case in the Roman Curia, led to the resignation of his office in favor of a relative and his retirement to Venice.    Threatened by the Inquisition, he prepared to apostatize, entered into communication with the English ambassador to Venice, Sir Henry Wotton, and having been assured of a welcome, left for England in 1616. On his way there, he published at Heidelberg a violent attack on Rome: Scogli del Christiano naufragio, afterwards reprinted in England.  He was received with open arms by James I, who quartered him upon Archbishop Abbot of Canterbury, called on the other bishops to pay him a pension, and granted him precedence after the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. De Dominis wrote a number of anti-Roman sermons, published his often reprinted chief work, De Republicâ Ecclesiasticâ contra Primatum Papæ (Vol. 1, 1617; vol. II, 1620, London; Vol. III, 1622, Hanau), and took part, as assistant, in the consecration of George Montaigne as Bishop of Lincoln, and Nicolas Felton as Bishop of Bristol on 14 December 1617. In that same year, James I made him Dean of Windsor and granted him the Mastership of the Savoy. Contemporary writers give no pleasant account of him, describing him as fat, irascible, pretentious and very avaricious; but his ability was undoubted, and in the theological controversies of the time he soon took a foremost place. His published attacks on the papacy succeeded each other in rapid succession: the Papatus Romanus, issued anonymously (London, 1617; Frankfort, 1618); the Scogli del naufragio Christiano, written in Switzerland (London, (?) 1618), of which English, French and German translations also appeared; and a Sermon preached in Italian before the king.But [SEP] his principal work was the De republica ecclesiastica, of which the first part after revision by Anglican theologians was published under royal patronage in London (1617), in which he set forth with a great display of erudition his theory of the church. In the main it is an elaborate treatise on the historic organization of the church, its principal note being its insistence on the divine prerogatives of the Catholic episcopate as against the encroachments of the papal monarchy. In 1619 Dominis published in London from a manuscript Paolo Sarpi's Historia del Concilio Tridentino. This history of the Council of Trent appeared in Italian, with an anti-Roman title page and letter dedicatory to James I. The manuscript had been obtained from Sarpi for George Abbot by his agent Nathaniel Brent.His vanity, avarice, and irascibility soon lost him his English friends; the projected Spanish marriage of Prince Charles made him anxious about the security of his position in England, and the election of Pope Gregory XV (9 February 1621) furnished him with an occasion of intimating, through Catholic diplomatists in England, his wish to return to Rome. The king's anger was aroused when De Dominis announced his intention (16 January 1622), and Star-Chamber proceedings for illegal correspondence with Rome were threatened. Eventually he was allowed to depart, but his chests of hoarded money were seized by the king's men, and only restored in response to a piteous personal appeal to the king.    Once out of England, his attacks upon the English Church were as violent as had been those on the Papacy, and in Sui Reditus ex Anglia Consilium (Paris, 1623) he recanted all he had written in his Consilium Profectionis (London, 1616), declaring that he had deliberately lied in all that he had said against Rome. After a stay of six months in Brussels he proceeded to Rome, where he lived on a pension assigned him by the Pope. On the death of Pope Gregory XV on 8 July 1623 the pension ceased, and irritation loosened his tongue. Coming into conflict with the Inquisition he was declared a relapsed heretic and was confined to the Castel Sant'Angelo. He there died a natural death in September 1624. Even his death did not end his trial. His case was continued after his death, and on 20 December 1624 judgment was pronounced over his corpse in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. His heresy was declared manifest, and by order of the Inquisition his body was taken from the coffin, dragged through the streets of Rome, and publicly burned in the Campo di Fiore together with his works, on 21 December 1624.By a strange irony, the publication of his Reditus consilium was subsequently forbidden in Venice because of its uncompromising advocacy of the supremacy of the Pope over the temporal powers. As a theologian and an ecclesiastic Dominis was thoroughly discredited; as a man of science he was more happy.     In 1611 he published, at Venice, a scientific work entitled: Tractatus de radiis visus et lucis in vitris, perspectivis et iride, in which, according to Isaac Newton, he was the first to develop the theory of the rainbow by drawing attention to the fact that in each raindrop the light undergoes two refractions and an intermediate reflection. His claim to that distinction is, however, disputed in favor of Descartes. In 1625 his work ""Euripus, seu de fluxu et refluxu maris sententia"" was published posthumously in Rome. It is an important source for the strange story of the theory of tides. It contains an exact but qualitative, luni-solar explanation of the phaenomena. This explanation is directly connected with the later developments.    De Dominis was caricatured in Thomas Middleton's 1624 play A Game at Chess. He is portrayed as the cynical 'Fat Bishop of Spalato' who changes faiths as much as it suits him.   "
"Francesco Leonardi (Serbian: Franjo Leonardi, Albanian: Françesko Leonardi;  died 1646) was a Papal missionary who served as Archbishop of Antivari in the mid-17th century. [SEP]    Leonardi was born in the Venetian city of Traú (today's Trogir, in Croatia), in Dalmatia. He finished his theological and philosophical studies in Rome, graduating with a doctorate. Leonardi began as an episcopal vicar, however, due to his education and abilities, he became a delegate of the Congregation of Religious Propaganda under the Roman Curia. He received orders in 1636 to spread Catholicism throughout Dalmatia and the Bay of Cattaro. He was especially devoted to the conversion of the local Paštrović clan to Catholicism. In his report to the Congregation, he stated that the crossover of Montenegro to Catholicism is especially important in the spread of Catholicism in Serbia and the Balkans in general. In 1638, Leonardi met with Mardarius, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Cetinje, to discuss his potential conversion to Catholicism. The duo met once more in 1639 in Cetinje, discussing Mardarius' conversion to Catholicism and him visiting Rome. Mardarius expressed his readiness in accepting the offer, also demanding that the Roman Curia allot the same wages as the bishops under the Ottoman Empire. However, because of his closeness with the Curia, the Ottoman Turks imprisoned Mardarius. Upon his release from prison in early 1640, he met with Leonardi in Maine and converted to Catholicism, acknowledging submission to the Pope. Leonardi also met with Pajsije, the Patriarch of Peć, discussing his possible conversion to Catholicism. In 1644, Pope Innocent X appointed Leonardi as the Archbishop of Antivari. However, during his tenure, Leonardi never visited his archbishopric nor its seat in Antivari.   "
"Thomas Morosini (Italian: Tommaso Morosini; Venice, ca. 1170/1175 – Thessalonica, June/July 1211) was the first Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, from 1204 to his death in July 1211. [SEP] Morosini, then a sub-deacon, was elected patriarch by the Venetians immediately after the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade and the establishment of the Latin Empire. At first, his election was contested as uncanonical by Pope Innocent III. His tenure was troubled and decreased the Latin Church's prestige. His relationship to the court of the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders was strained due to questions of jurisdiction, accusations of embezzlement from the treasury of the Hagia Sophia, and chiefly due to Morosini's exclusive promotion of Venetian clergy to higher ecclesiastical offices. He also failed to reconcile the Orthodox Byzantine Greeks, both clergy and people, to Catholic rule; instead, they transferred their allegiance to the Empire of Nicaea. After his death, the see remained vacant until the election in November 1215 of Bishop Gervasius (Gervais) of Heraclea Pontica.   "
"Georgius Pelino (Albanian: Gjergj Pelini; fl. 1438–1463) was a Catholic priest, the abbot of Ratac Abbey and diplomat of Skanderbeg and Venetian Republic. [SEP]    Pelino's birthdate is unknown, but his birthplace Novo Brdo is stated in a 1441 document. From 1438 (or 1436) to 1463, he was the abbot of Ratac Abbey in nowadays Sutomore. His abbey was under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar, but he was not in good relations with its titulars, due to his ambitions to become himself head of Archdiocese. Many sources mention pharmacist Antonije Beli as Pelino's assistant.    In 1421 Pelino borrowed 1,505 perpers to Balša III when the latter decided to travel to visit Stefan Lazarević. Later, on 15 March 1445, Pelino requested from the Venetian Senate to authorize him to claim this amount from the heritage property of Jelena Balšić. Jelena Balšić also borrowed 205 ducats from Ratac Abbey and in 1446 Pelino added this amount to his claim, promising to forgive a half of it.The Treaty of Vučitrn, signed in Vučitrn on 22 April 1426 between Republic of Venice and Serbian Despotate, formally ended the Second Scutari War. By this treaty Venice ceded Ratac to the Serbian Despotate. Ratac was included into the list of Serbian demands probably based on the pressure of the people from Bar on Serbian negotiators. Stefan Lazarević confirmed the privileges of Ratac Abbey initially granted by the King Milutin. To negotiate this confirmation Pelino traveled to meet Lazarević in his court. In 1438 he traveled to Dubrovnik as ambassador of despot Đurađ Branković.In 1441, together with Gjon Gazulli he is mentioned as a member of a diplomatic mission in Italy. In Autumn 1442 Pelino was expelled from Ratac Abbey by Stephen Vukčić for seven months period. Vukčić put a price on Pelino's head. During this period Pelino appealed to the Venetian Senate to support his appointment on the position of archbishop of Archdiocese of Bar. Venetian Senate promised that it would negotiate with the Pope to appoint Pelino on some vacant position of archbishop or some other position in the church hierarchy. In the meantime the Senate granted Pelino 10 monthly provisions paid from the treasury of Kotor.    The years-long dispute between Pelino and Marin Adamović, a jeweler from Kotor, was ended in 1444. At the beginning of 1445 archbishop of Bar complained to the Venetians about Pelino. This was a beginning of Pelino's long struggle with Bar archbishops and governors to keep privileges his abbey had within Serbian Despotate. Together with Andrea, the Bishop of Arbër, Pelino participated as a negotiator between Skanderbeg and Venice Republic during the peace treaty negotiations that ended Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–1448.In 1448 Pelino was expelled from Ratac Abbey for the second time. In this case by Venetian governor of Bar, Jakov Delfino who also, in the name of all Bar clergy, wrote a letter to pope complaining against Pelino.Pelino often borrowed money to Venetians. In 1450 Pelino borrowed 1,508 perpers to Venetian Republic. In 1451 he again borrowed substantial amount to Venetians.While Venice proveditors of Scutari and Durazzo were helping the Ottoman army during the First Siege of Krujë, as a representative of Skanderbeg, in October 1450 he proposed to the Venice to cede them a sovereignty over the city of Krujë. On November 1450 Venice informed him that his request was not accepted, because it had not enough soldiers to do so. In period 1453-56 Pelino was appointed as Protonotary apostolic and wrote Skanderbeg's charters. Mainly due to Pelino's efforts the peace treaty privileges and payment conditions were renewed in 1456. Based on the privileges granted to Ratac Abbey by Serbian Nemanjić dynasty, Pelino complained to Venetian Senate when governors of Bar starting from 1456 insisted that Ratac should pay tax of one tenth of its income from vine and olive oil. In July 1457 Pelino complained to Venetians that Paštrovići still control four villages conquered during campaign of Altomanović. In 1458 Ratac was finally completely released from the obligations to pay one tenth of its income to Bar and thanks to Pelino's efforts four villages controlled by Paštrovići were returned under control of Ratac Abbey.In June 1457 Pelino brought Skanderbeg's letter to Venetians. In this letter Skanderbeg complained  because Venetians irregularly paying him agreed provisions. Later, in the same year, in the name of Skanderbeg Pelino went in a diplomatic mission to Pope Callixtus III and convinced him to continue to pay allowances to Skanderbeg.In 1458 during the conflict between Skanderbeg and Lekë Dukagjini, he acted as an intermediary between Skanderbeg and Venice, achieving a personal success in forging the bases for a future military alliance between them. In a sign of good will, in 1459 Skanderbeg handed over to Venice the castle of Sati, that he had captured from Lekë Dukagjini that year. Pleased by this act, Venice rewarded Pelino's brothers with a monthly pension. In 1460 Skanderbeg appointed him as his personal ambassador. When Venetian Republic stopped paying provisions to Skanderbeg in 1462 Pelino managed to convince Venetian Senate to continue payment of the provisions of 600 ducats per year and to pay all retained provisions. For his success in negotiations with Skanderbeg Pelino was paid by the Venetians, so he was not only Skanderbeg's diplomat in Venice but also Venice's diplomat at Skanderbeg and actually a mediator between two parties. In 1463 he played an important role in the signing of an alliance treaty between Skanderbeg and the Republic of Venice. On 20 October 1463 Pelino was mentioned for the last time in documents, as Skanderbeg's envoy in Venice. Taking in consideration that on 13 December 1463 Pal Gazulli was again mentioned as Skanderbeg's envoy in Venice, it is assumed that Pelino died in this period.      "

"Bailo or baylo (plural baili or bayli) is a Venetian title that derives from the Latin term baiulus, meaning ""porter, bearer"". In English, it may be translated bailiff, or otherwise rendered as bailey, baili, bailie, bailli or baillie. [SEP] The office of a bailo is a bailaggio (sometimes anglicised ""bailate""). The term was transliterated into Greek as  (baioulos), but Nicephorus Gregoras translated it  (epitropos, steward) or  (ephoros, overseer).In the Middle Ages, a bailo was a resident ambassador of the Republic of Venice. The most famous baili were those at Constantinople, who were, from 1268, the Venetian ambassadors to the Byzantine court and, after 1453, to the Ottoman government. There were also permanent baili at Negroponte, Durazzo and Corfu. Baili were also sent to represent Venetian interests at the courts of Cyprus, Acre (Jerusalem), Armenia and Trebizond. In the mid-thirteenth century, the Venetian consuls in Tyre and Tripoli in the kingdom of Acre were upgraded to the rank of bailo. Venice also sent baili to oversee its colonies at Aleppo, Antivari, Koroni, Modon, Nauplia, Patras and Tenedos.The term baiulus was first used in Venetian documents translated from Arabic in the twelfth century. It was originally used to refer to Muslim officials, but in the thirteenth century came to be applied to special envoys sent by Venice to govern its colonies in Frankish Greece. These governors doubled as diplomats. They operated courts for the Venetian colonists, collected taxes and customs dues and supervised Venetian trade. Each was assisted by a chancery (run by a chancellor) and a Council of Twelve, composed of the leading men of the colony and modeled on the Council of Ten in Venice. Each had a chaplain, a physician and an interpreter (or dragoman). Each sent back regular reports to Venice on the local politics, the affairs of the colony and, most importantly, the prices and quantities of goods in the local market. He was the superior of the consuls operating in the same country.By the end of the 15th century, the office of bailo had mostly disappeared, with those operating on foreign soil being downgraded to consuls and those governing Venetian territories being termed rectors, captains or podestà. The bailates of Constantinople and Corfu, however, survived until the end of the republic in 1797.   "

"Alessio Spani or Lekë Shpani (1442-1495) was an Albanian nobleman.

A member of the Spani family he claimed that he was descended from several imperial Byzantine families. In Gjon Muzaka's 1510 work Breve memoria de li discendenti de nostra casa Musachi  he is mentioned as a descendant of Emperor Theodosius, although it is unclear to whom it refers as there were three Byzantine emperors named Theodosius. The Byzantine author Andreas Angelos Komnenos mentions Alexios III Angelos as his great-great-great grandfather in his work Constitutio Ordinis Constantiniani Equestris. According to that account his father was Michael, Duke of Drivast and his mother Helena Span. The surname Span or Spani probably derives from the Greek word spanos (beardless).

Karl Hopf has also included another son named Alessandro.    Span's activities were closely related to the Venetian ones in Albania. Gabriel Trivisano, proveditor of Venice in Albania, includes Span in the group of the Albanian nobles that were favourable to Venice and informed him about the political conditions in Albania. Span played an important role as an intermediary during the peace negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire represented by Mahmud Pasha in the late 1460s.

"Pantaleone Barbo  was a distinguished diplomat of the Venetian Republic. [SEP] He was the Venetian ambassador to Constantinople, and became the first bailo of Corfu in 1389. Amongst his other diplomatic appointments, he served as Provveditore of Crete in 1363, captain of Crete in 1389, and duke of Crete in 1395. He also served as bailo and captain of Negroponte.    Barbo was sent as Venetian ambassador to Constantinople on the occasion of the death of John V Palaiologos ""to express the Republic's distress 'at the death of our true and perfect friend'"" and to liaise with John V's successor Manuel II Palaiologos.In 1386 Barbo accompanied Venetian diplomat Lorenzo de Monacis to Hungary representing Venice's interests during a crisis involving the succession to the Hungarian throne. The diplomatic mission was successful as described in a report by de Monacis to the Venetian government.In 1389, Barbo accompanied de Monacis again on another diplomatic mission to Hungary when they fell victims to robbery. The two diplomats, having lost all their belongings  during the incident, received 60 gold ducats as compensation by the Maggior Consiglio of Venice.

According to the Doge, ""it would be offensive to God and to all mankind to disperse the Greek population of Tenedos and to destroy everything on the island"". The doge also wanted to keep the island as an aid to maritime navigation and argued that the Ottomans could rebuild it even if the Venetians destroyed it.However the proposal of the Doge did not succeed due to Genoan and Venetian opposition.

Additional sentence proposals included imprisonment of between six months to a year ""in one of the lower prisons"" and exile from Venice and the Veneto for five years. These proposals were rejected by the Senate. Eventually the sentence was reduced after the Tenedos controversy had subsided.

"A bailo, also spelled baylo (pl. baili / bailos) was a diplomat who oversaw the affairs of the Republic of Venice in Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, and was a permanent fixture in the city around 1454.The [SEP] traumatic outcomes of Venice's wars with the Ottomans made it clear to its rulers that in the Ottoman case the city would have to rely chiefly on diplomatic and political means rather than offensive military efforts to maintain and defend its position in the eastern Mediterranean. The bailo's job was very extensive because he was both Venice's political and foreign ambassador. He was very important in maintaining a good relationship between the Ottoman Sultan and the Venetian government. He was also there to represent and protect Venetian political interests.  In Constantinople the bailo worked to solve any misunderstandings between the Ottomans and Venetians. To do this they established contacts and friendships with influential Ottomans and by doing this, they were able to protect their own interests. Unfortunately there were instances where there were difficulties finding replacements. This was often due to not enough qualified replacements, refusal to accept the position and the replacement dying before reaching Constantinople.    Like English bailiff, the Venetian word bailo derives from Latin baiulus, which originally meant ""porter (carrier)"". The Ottoman term was bālyōs or bālyoz.     Sometime between the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the outbreak of the Second Ottoman–Venetian War in 1499, the baili relocated to the center of Galata. After another war the bailo relocated to one of Galata’s suburbs, to an embassy called Vigne di Pera. This house was used as a summer home and as a refuge from the plague. After the War of Cyprus, the embassy in Galata relocated to Vigne di Pera permanently. Most baili preferred this location over the one in Galata because it had less restrictions in after-hours travel, and its location proved ideal in smuggling slaves.Vigne di Pera was a large complex surrounded by wall, with smaller complexes located inside. It had a large enough area to play ball in, a small chapel and housing quarters for the bailo’s postal carriers (to prevent the bailo from getting sick). There were two parts to the embassy, a public and private area. The private area housed the bailo, his company, his Janissary corps, and the secretarial staff. The public area was used as a receiving area for dignitaries and other important people, as well as a banquet hall for special occasions and parties.     One of the major responsibilities of the bailo was to collect information on the Ottoman Empire. They usually got this information though their wide networks of friends, their household and an informal spy network. This informal spy network consisted of moles: those who worked in the Imperial Arsenal in Galata, banished men and women, merchants and their associates and even people who worked within the Ottoman bureaucracy. The baili also set up moles in other foreign embassies.The bailo had the responsibility to promote and protect  Venetian trade. This became the case after the Battle of Lepanto, when the bailo’s head ordered them to protect the integrity of their merchant powers from the English, Dutch and Florentines. The baili barely paid attention to commercial matters. saying it was too complicated to be bothered with, but every time there was a new sultan they made sure any agreements made with the previous sultan were followed though (this was made to protect Venetian citizens, goods and property, and this required a lot of attention from the bailo to make sure they were not being double crossed).Protecting the business interests of the Venetians involved in international commerce was also a function of the bailo. This was done especially if the person requested the bailo in settling debts with other people. They had to make sure business was good and were responsible for the Venetian subjects in Constantinople, especially if they died. Baili also acted as judges on the Venetian subjects because of their superior status. They usually presided over commercial and legal matters. Another responsibility was that he was in charge of all the trade in Ottoman lands and replacing consuls whenever he wanted to.The bailo was forbidden to actually do commerce such as trading themselves or represent other people commercially because situations might arise and fast become complicated and the bailo would be held accountable for whatever that person may have done; also, the integrity of the mission would become compromised. Although forbidden to engage in commercial acts, the bailos did so anyway.    All of the baili were drawn from the ranks of the Venetian patriciate; this was a fundamental requirement, and most were drawn from the top tier of this oligarchy which dominated Venetian political life.Many baili did not marry – this can be attributed to the fact that most held this position to give their family economic prestige, and had other male siblings who carried on the family name. The bailo was also involved in the Latin rite communities of the Ottoman Empire. They did things like getting churches that could be used by Venetians, and representing the Roman Catholics. The baili had active social lives and were present in confraternities, protected the company of the holy sacrament, patronized artists and artisans in the creation of religious objects and decorations for Latin-rite churches of Constantinople and Galata.One spiritual and diplomatic duty was to free Christian slaves unless they voluntarily converted to Islam. The major problem with this is that the bailo couldn’t release too many slaves or they would anger the sultan. The bailo actually had funds reserved for freeing slaves and, because of this, they were often accosted by many people asking for the bailo’s help. These funds either came out of their own pocket or from church donations from Venice.There were many reasons as to why many members of the patriciate did not want to become a bailo. There was a health risk associated with going to Constantinople – the long journey seemed to kill people and more seemed to be dying in the city itself. After several deaths during the voyage to Constantinople, the Venetian government allowed doctors to accompany the baili to keep them from dying. In case of hostilities, the baili were often in danger of being held hostage, but this was just a loose form of house arrest and the bailo was even allowed leave the house, especially if it was for religious purposes. It was rare that baili were executed, but the possibility of this happening was a further deterrent to holding this office.Money was hard to come by and most baili had to fund themselves. This was especially hard if they had no money in the first place. Often the bailo resorted to borrowing money from merchants, but this became increasing difficult as these merchants realized it took almost a year for the bailo to pay them back and started to refuse the bailo’s requests.    Giacomo Casanova mentions in his memoirs that during his stay in Corfu, the bailo of Constantinople, stopped on the island on his way to Constantinople aboard a 72-gun frigate named Europa. Having a greater rank than that of the Provveditore of Corfu, the flag of the bailo, bearing the colours of the captain-general of the Venetian Navy, was raised during his one-week stay on the island, while the flag with the colours of the Provveditore was lowered.

Crangenor (Kondungallor), and Cochin. Of Kannur, he noted it as being ruled by a gentle king, and serving as a hub of the cardamon trade. He noted the population's habit of chewing Betel.He wrote about pearl diving off the coasts from Cao Comeri to Baste de Chilao (Chennai) and Ceylon. He discusses the politics of Ceylon and the limited control that the Portuguese had over only the town of Colombo.He went to Negapatan (Nagapattinam) and San Tome. Travelling on a Portuguese galleon he passed the Andaman islands, inhabited by ""people of the jungle"". In northeastern India, he visited Orifa (Orissa), the city of Satagan (Sonargaon) in Bengal on Gulf of Martavan (Martaban), and Sion (Sirian), a city conquered by the king of Pegu. He sailed to Malacca and passed the channel of Nicobar to the island of Sumatra.He returned through Baghdad and Aleppo  to Europe, and landed again at Venice in November, 1581. He then wrote in Italian an account of his voyages, published at Venice in 1587.While Marco Polo's travels were centuries old by Federici's time, the latter explorer is generally contemporary with travels by the fellow-Venetian Niccolò de' Conti and Gasparo Balbi. The Genoese Hieronymo di San Stefano and Varthema of Bologna, occurred at the beginning of the 16th century.

"Marco Barbarigo (fl. 1388–d. 1428) was a Venetian nobleman, who married Helena Thopia and thus inherited the rule of Croia (Krujë) (in modern Albania), which he initially held under Venetian and later, after quarrelling with Venetian noblemen, Ottoman suzerainty, until in late 1394 when he was defeated by Venetian subject Niketa Thopia (his wife's cousin) and forced into exile at the court of Đurađ II Balšić. [SEP] He was appointed the Venetian governor (as ""count"" or ""captain"") of Cattaro (Kotor) in ca. 1422.    Barbarigo was a Venetian businessman.  He married Helena Thopia, the daughter of Albanian magnate Karl Topia, who had ruled as ""Prince of Albania"" from Durazzo and had since 1386 served as a Venetian vassal. After Karl's death in 1388, Barbarigo inherited the castle of Croia and the surrounding region through his wife. He ruled from the strong fortress of Croia and held the possessions under Venetian suzerainty.After the Ottomans had occupied Scutari (by early 1393), they defeated Demetrius Jonima, who then set up a meeting between Barbarigo and the Ottomans. As Barbarigo had recently quarrelled with the Venetians, and likely felt an Ottoman threat, he accepted Ottoman suzerainty. He had a meeting with Beyazid. He retained Croia and his lands which stretched to Durazzo, and began to plunder Venetian holdings in the vicinity of Durazzo. Venice ordered Niketa Thopia, the governor of Durazzo, to answer the plundering; Thopia heavily defeated Barbarigo. The Ottomans, presumably disappointed, installed their vassal Konstantin Balšić as governor of Croia; Barbarigo was exiled, taking refuge at the court of Đurađ II Balšić, who at the time was also an Ottoman subject. Konstantin soon married Barbarigo's wife Helena, who had the hereditary rights to Croia. In chronicles, Helena is said to have been unfaithful, transferring Croia to her lover, Konstantin. Đurađ II had declined an offer of 1,000 ducats to give up Barbarigo to the Venetians. Afterwards, Đurađ II broke ties with the Ottomans and seized rival Konstantin's stronghold Dagno in 1395, with Venetian assistance.In 1400, Barbarigo attacked Venetian merchant Phillip Barelli on the Cape of Rodon, and wed his wife, after which there is no more mention of Barelli in history.Around 1422, he was appointed overseer of Cattaro (Kotor). He succeeded Antonio Boccole. Stefan Lazarević, the ruler of the Serbian Despotate, had been ceded Zeta from his nephew Balša III (Đurađ II's successor) in April 1421, but the Venetians did not recognize him, holding on to the occupied Zetan coast (including the Bay of Kotor) and Bojana, including Drivast recaptured by them after Balša's death. The Venetians had no intention to cede Balša's former possessions to Despot Stefan and even requested Ottoman support in case of an attack. The Second Scutari War followed, which ended inconclusive in August 1423 with the Treaty of Sveti Srdj; in it, Kotor accepted Venetian suzerainty. He was succeeded as governor of Cattaro by Stefano Querini, who held office until 1425. Marco Barbarigo died in 1428.      "

Janko had brothers Jovan, Stjepan, Pavle, and Andrija, and probably was among the youngest brothers.

"Stanislav ""Stanko"" Sočivica (c. 1715 – fl. 1777) was a Serbian hajduk (brigand) active in the Ottoman territories in western Balkans (sanjaks of Herzegovina, Bosnia and Montenegro). Born in a village close to Bileća, his family owned a farm subject to a harsh Ottoman bey family. [SEP] After murdering the beys and taking their collected taxes, the family subsequently relocated to Venetian Dalmatia from where Sočivica and his brothers began their brigandage. After decades of brigandage, and the capture of his wive and children, he retired to the Habsburg Monarchy, where he was appointed commander of the Pandurs by Emperor Joseph II himself, in 1775.       Sočivica was born in c. 1715 in the village of Simijova northwest of Bileća in the Sanjak of Herzegovina (Ottoman Empire). Ivan Lovrić (fl. 1756–77) wrote the biography of Sočivica, while his life story was mentioned by Alberto Fortis (1741–1803), based on Sočivica's own narrative. He was of normal stature, had a long face, and blue eyes. His father, Vuk, was a farmer, whose land was owned by an infamous family of rich Turks, the Umetalčić, who were very harsh towards the family: they not only constantly insulted them, but also beat them severely. Stanko, a turbulent and ferocious person, plotted with his three brothers against their masters, but their father who was mild and pacific advised them not to act, for several years. Two of his brothers were named Ilija and Nikola. The three Umetalčić brothers, having headed from Poplat (Berkovići) to nearby Vranjska to collect haraç (tax), had by chance decided to lodge at the Sočivica farm, carrying with them a purse of 18,000 sequins that they had collected on the way. Stanko convinced his two brothers that this was a chance for vengeance, and enrichment, and persuaded them to murder the three guests. They then had them buried in a deep ditch by the farm.After the murders, the family did not flee; in retaliation, the Pasha of Trebinje and the captain of the guards arrested up to 50 Christians, some of whom were executed, the other made slaves, but no suspicion fell on the brothers. In about a year, however, there were some doubts; Stanko's rashness, and the sum of money they suddenly had, forced them to leave their home and decamp. Their father died on the way.        The family arrived in Imotski, which at the time was under the sovereignty of the Republic of Venice (Venetian Dalmatia), and built a house and opened up a shop with excellent and expensive merchandise, with the Ottoman money, in 1745. The merchant life did not suit Stanko's activeness, thus, he and an entourage of 10 men turned to Montenegro, where they by the course of the summer massacred 40 Turks. It is thought that he never committed an offence against subjects of Venice or Austria, but entirely directed his fury against the Turkish people.After several expeditions, joined by one of his brothers, he returned to Imotski where he resided for 9 years, working in the trade established by his family. He made excursions from time to time, and assassinated Turks. One of his brothers was in the band together with distinguished hajduk Lazar Pecirep. Stanislav Sočivica and Lazar Pecirep were the most distinguished hajduks of their time.    Sočivica's brother, who had accompanied him on his expeditions, joined the most furious hajduks (brigands) in the country, and became a blood brother (pobratime) with an Orthodox Morlach, who, in spite of the brotherhood, got him drunk and delivered him to the Pasha of Travnik where he was tortured to death. After hearing of his brother's death, Sočivica immediately went to the house of the blood brother, where he was received by his father. The father told a story in a manner posing his son as entirely innocent, and when the blood brother appeared he displayed great kindness, then went out under the pretence of seeking the finest lamb in his flock to treat Sočivica; his real intention was to deliver him to the Turks stationed in Duvno, 19 km from the house. As the blood brother had not yet returned, the house retired to rest, all except Stanko. He was tormented with bad feelings, and rose from his bed in search for a light, but could find none throughout the house. Suspicion and rage arose, and he sought his arms, but could not find them, and he called loudly, but to no answers. He went to the bedside of the father, demanding his arms. The father, who expected his son returning with Turks, sought to gain time by equivocating, Sočivica then rashly crushed his head with a small axe, then went to an old female servant, who complied with him. As soon as he regained his arms, he left the house and lurked at a distance, to watch the event and ascertain the blood brother's treachery, of which he soon gained proof of. Sočivica then assembled a few friends, surrounded and set the house on fire. 17 people died in the flames, and a woman who attempted to escape was shot together with her infant in her arms. From this time on, the Ottomans pursued Stanko with maximum rancour, and Sočivica in the meantime multiplied his murders and robberies.In August 1754, the same year when he had burnt the house, he narrowly escaped the pursuit of a party of Croats, who were out in search of him, and concluding that he was no longer safe in Venetian territory, he sent for his family to join him in Karlowitz (Sremski Karlovci), to which he travelled to by foot.    As he was pursued on every side, he retired with his family to Sremski Karlovci, in the Military Frontier of Habsburg Austria (modern Serbia). He lived an innocent life there for 3 years, together with his two brothers, wife, son and daughter.An undisclosed person betrayed him into the hands of the same Pasha that killed his brother, and his wife and children were later captured in the same manner. The three Sočivica brothers were imprisoned at a fort beyond Udbina, at the Ottoman–Venetian–Austrian frontier, and then escorted by 100 cavalrymen before the Pasha of Travnik, to be relocated to the prison in Travnik. They were given two choices, conversion into Islam, or impalement, accepting the former. His two brothers were released, and one of them was bestowed the title of aga, while Stanislav, known for his public antagonism towards the Ottomans, remained imprisoned. His two brothers took the first opportunity to flee the Ottomans, upon which the enraged Pasha annulled the conversion of Stanislav, who had been given the name Ibrahim, and ordered for a more strained imprisonment with constant overwatch. His new strategy was to tell the guards of buried treasures, and that he would show the Pasha the locations in return of privileges that he had before his brothers' escape. For a month, Sočivica took the guards to different locations where he had either kept a sum of money, or places where he claimed he had mistaken. On 26 November 1758 Sočivica and his family, which had been lured to meet up with Sočivica as a free man, were brought before the Effendi. He later managed to escape during the journey. As his family members were still prisoners, he negotiated for their release with the Pasha, but in vain. As all methods failed, he resorted to write to the Pasha:  I am informed, O pasha of Bosnia, that you complain of my escape; but I put it to yourself, what would you have done in my place? Would you have suffered yourself to be bound with cord like a miserable beast, and led without resistance by men, who, as soon as they arrived at a certain place, would in all probability, have put you to death? Nature impels us to avoid destruction, and I have only acted in obedience to her laws. Tell me, pacha, what crime have my wife and children committed, that, in spite of law and justice, you should retain them like slaves? Perhaps you hope to render me more submissive; but you cannot surely expect that I shall return to you, and hold forth my arms to be loaded with fresh chains. No; you do but deceive yourself, and render me more terrible than before. Hear me then, pacha: you may exhaust on them all your fury, without producing the least advantage. On my part I declare, I will wreak my vengeance on all the Turks, your subjects, who may fall into my hands; and I will omit no means of injuring you. – For the love of God, restore to me, I beseech you, my blood. Obtain my pardon from my sovereign, and no longer retain in your memory my past offences. I promise that I will then leave your subjects in tranquillity, and even serve them as a guide when necessary.  If you refuse me this favour, expect from me all that despair can prompt. I will assemble my friends, carry destruction wherever you reside, pillage your property, plunder your merchants; and from this moment, if you pay no attention to my entreaties, I swear that I will massacre every Turk that falls into my hands. The Pasha did not give much attention to the letter, and Stanko exerted himself in accomplishing the vow he made. He devastated the country, showing proof of his heroism; so much that the people were forced to request the pasha for help from the devastation, by sending back his wife and children. The Pasha, however, was unrelentless, and Stanko could only free his family with force and strategy.    Sočivica's men captured a Turk who had earlier helped one of his brothers to escape, and the brother, in opposition to the chief and the rest of the band, was anxious to return the favour. Although the Turk was destined to die, the grateful brother, while Stanko was at prayers, set him free. The other hajduks were outraged, and one of his nephews even punched him; the brother then drew a gun and killed him on the spot. Sočivica expelled his brother, and after the funeral of his nephew, felt such a humiliation that he decided to retire.However, his habits were not so easily changed. After a short retirement he suddenly resumed the banditry, plundering on the highway. After his many massacres and robberies, he only had a possession of 600 sequins, which he confided to a friend and a cousin, however, both ran off with the money.Later, in 1775, Emperor Joseph II, while passing by Grazach, where Sočivica resided, wished to see him. Joseph II brought him and interrogated him, and made him repeat the main events of his life, then gave him a considerable sum of money and appointed him the harambaša of the Pandurs. He lived at Grazach in 1777, at the time when his biography was first written. In 1800, it was not known whether he was dead.    Stanko managed to have his wife and son released from captivity in Ottoman Travnik, and had them brought to the Serbian Orthodox Dragović monastery, in Venetian territory, where a monk learnt his son how to read and write.

"Sir William Waller (c. 1597 – 19 September 1668) was an English soldier and politician, who commanded Parliamentary armies during the First English Civil War, before relinquishing his commission under the 1645 Self-denying Ordinance. [SEP] Elected MP for Andover in 1640, then 1642, in June 1647 he was one of the Eleven Members accused of destabilising the kingdom. He was suspended in Pride's Purge of 1648, and arrested several times between 1650 and 1659. At the 1660 Restoration, he was elected to the Convention Parliament, but retired from politics when it dissolved. He died at Osterley Park, London in September 1668. Waller was one of many who served in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms with great reluctance, but did so based on deeply held religious or political principles. He is perhaps best remembered by a letter written in 1643 to his close friend and Royalist opponent, Sir Ralph Hopton.  That great God who is the searcher of my heart knows with what a sad sense I go upon this service, and with what a perfect hatred I detest this war without an enemy;... We are both upon the stage and must act such parts as are assigned us in this tragedy, let us do it in a way of honour, and without personal animosities.    William Waller was born in Knole, near Sevenoaks in Kent, son of Sir Thomas Waller and his wife Margaret Lennard, the daughter of Margaret Fiennes, 11th Baroness Dacre. He attended Magdalen Hall, Oxford, but did not graduate.He married three times; Jane Reynell (1622–1633), Lady Anne Finch (1638–1652), and Lady Anne Harcourt (1652–1661). In all, he had three sons and three daughters.     The family held various offices in the 16th century, including constable of Dover Castle and MP for Dover, but lost their money. Waller became a professional soldier, and in 1617, he joined the army of the Venetian Republic, where he met the English mercenary leader, Sir Horace Vere. In 1620, he and Sir Ralph Hopton were members of the personal bodyguard for Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, sister of the future Charles I. After her husband Frederick was defeated at White Mountain in November, they escorted her to safety in Frankfurt.On his return in 1622, he was rewarded with a knighthood, while he inherited the right to wine import duties from his grandmother, which brought him the then substantial sum of £1,000 – £3,000 per year. This allowed him to marry Jane Reynell, from a wealthy Devon family; she died in 1633, followed by her father in 1634, then their son Richard in 1636. Waller inherited most of her estates, and he purchased a quarter-share in the Providence Island Company. A devout Presbyterian, this directly connected to others who shared his beliefs, and later became prominent supporters of Parliament, among them John Pym, Henry Darley, Lord Saye, and Lord Brooke.His second wife, Lady Anne Finch, was related to another influential Kent politician, the Earl of Winchilsea, and shared his religious beliefs. They purchased Winchester Castle in 1638, and lived a 'retired life' in the country, but as the political conflict between Charles and Parliament increased, Waller felt it his duty to participate. In April 1640, he was elected to the Short Parliament as Member of Parliament for Andover, then re-elected to the Long Parliament on 3 May 1642.     A firm supporter of Parliament, when the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Waller was appointed a colonel, capturing Portsmouth, Farnham, Winchester and other key locations in southern England. At the beginning of 1643, Waller was promoted Major-general and placed in charge of operations in the region of Gloucester and Bristol.He was then called upon to oppose the advance of his old friend Sir Ralph Hopton, leader of the Royalist Western army, After the inconclusive Battle of Lansdowne on 5 July, Hopton linked up with Prince Maurice, and their combined force destroyed William Waller's Western Association army at Roundway Down on 13 July. The biggest Royalist success of the war, it secured the West Country, apart from isolated garrisons in Plymouth and elsewhere.Although defeat at Roundway had little impact on Waller's military reputation, there were increasing signs on all sides of war weariness, including anti-war demonstrations on 7 to 9 August in London. At a strategy meeting in Oxford, the Royalist high command agreed Prince Rupert would capture Gloucester, the last major Parliamentary position in the west, then move against London. This would be supported by Hopton advancing into Hampshire and Sussex, whose iron foundries were Parliament's main source of armaments.To counter this, Waller assembled a new army at Farnham Castle, consisting of Trained bands from the South-Eastern Association of Kent, Sussex and Hampshire, bolstered by others from London.    Throughout the war, both sides relied on these militia; service was normally limited to 30 days, within their home area, but as the largest and best equipped, London units were often used by Parliament to fill gaps. Waller's army included several regiments mustered to repel Prince Rupert's advance on London, which ended at Newbury in late September. An attack on Basing House in November failed, with many shouting 'Home! Home!'.Under instructions from the Earl of Essex to retake Alton, then Arundel, Waller persuaded the London Bands to help him capture Alton on 13 December. When he asked for their help with Arundel, they refused, and were sent home on 15 December. However, he successfully captured Arundel on 6 January, before a heavy snow fall ended operations for the next few weeks.By the end of February, Waller's army had been increased to 5,000 infantry and 3,500 horse; he was ordered to slip past Hopton and retake the west. One of his commanders, Sir Richard Grenville, deserted in early March, and shared this with the Royalist command, who sent Hopton reinforcements. Waller defeated him at Cheriton on 29 March 1644, ending the Royalist threat in the south-east, then joined Essex to threaten the Royalist capital of Oxford.  To avoid being trapped in Oxford, a Royalist field army nominally commanded by Charles retreated to Worcester; Essex ordered Waller to follow him, while he went west to relieve the siege of Lyme Regis. On 29 June, Waller clashed with Charles at Cropredy Bridge; his losses were minimal, but his men were demoralised. His army disintegrated, causing panic in London, and allowing Charles to pursue Essex into the West Country.In September, Essex and his army were trapped at Lostwithiel; 5,000 infantry were forced to surrender, although Essex and the cavalry escaped. At Second Newbury on 27 October, the Royalists lifted the siege of Donnington Castle; lack of co-ordination among the Parliamentary forces under Waller, Essex and Manchester allowed Charles to re-enter Oxford.Parliament was split into peace and war factions. The 'Peace Party' was dominated by English Presbyterians, with Scottish support; concerned by political radicals like the Levellers, they wanted an immediate, negotiated settlement. The 'War Party' fundamentally mistrusted Charles, and saw military victory as the only way to secure their objectives. They also objected to the Scottish alliance, especially the demand for a unified, Presbyterian church of England and Scotland; Oliver Cromwell claimed he would fight, rather than accept such terms.This conflict became public in recriminations over the failure to exploit Marston Moor, Essex' capitulation at Lostwithiel, and Manchester's alleged unwillingness to fight at Second Newbury; Waller supported these criticisms. In December, Sir Henry Vane introduced the Self-denying Ordinance, requiring any officers in the army or navy who were also members of Parliament to resign from one, or the other. This automatically removed Manchester and Essex, since they could not resign their titles, although later amended to allow them to be re-appointed, 'if Parliament approved.' Waller supported the Ordinance, and resigned his commission in April 1645.    Considered for command in Ireland, Waller also briefly explored returning to Venetian service, but this ended his active military career. Although he backed the creation of the New Model Army, like other Presbyterians, he came to see it as a threat, and supported attempts to disband it when the war ended in 1646. In June 1647, he was one of the Eleven members accused by Cromwell and other Independents of 'plotting to destabilise the kingdom', and fled abroad in August.He stayed in The Hague, where he renewed his acquaintance with Elizabeth of Bohemia, before returning home in June 1648. He was arrested in 1650, allegedly for conspiring to restore Charles II, then released in early 1652. He purchased Osterley Park in 1654, and while frequently questioned under the Protectorate, avoided implication in the 1655 Penruddock uprising.At the 1660 Restoration, he was elected for Middlesex to the Convention Parliament, but subsequently retired from political life. He spent some of his time writing A Vindication of the Character and Conduct of Sir William Waller, which was not published until 1793.He died on 19 September 1668, and was buried in Westminster Chapel.

"The Capitano delle Navi (""Captain of the Ships"") was a senior commander of the ships of the line of the navy of the Republic of Venice. [SEP]    The Venetian navy had traditionally been a galley-based force. The first organized tactical formations of sailing ships began being formed in the late 15th century. The position of Capitano delle Navi was established as the commander of the larger sailing ships built by the Venetian government, but he also assumed control—under the overall authority of the Captain General of the Sea—over all sailing ships in the battle fleet, which were mostly merchant vessels, chartered in Venice or abroad (usually Holland) for naval service.During the 17th century sailing ships of the line began to play a more important role and comprised a larger and larger portion of the Venetian battle fleet, particularly during the War of Candia. The increase in numbers necessitated the creation of more squadrons, initially by the appointment of a second Capitano delle Navi or of a Vice Capitano delle Navi, but in 1657 two new positions, the Almirante and the Patron delle Navi were created to command the second and third sailing ship divisions, while the Capitano delle Navi commanded the first division.At the outbreak of the Morean War in 1684 the Republic mobilized 24 sailing ships along with 30 galleys, and during that conflict and the subsequent Seventh Ottoman–Venetian War, the sailing ships played the main role in fleet actions. During the latter two wars when the Venetians sent as many as 36 ships of the line into battle, the senior position of Capitano Straordinario delle Navi was created, who now commanded the first division of 9 ships, while the Capitano delle Navi commanded the second.The post of Capitano delle Navi remained the highest peacetime rank for the commanders of the sailing fleet (armata grossa). Appointment to the post was usually for three years. As distinctive signs, the flagship of the Capitano delle Navi carried a single lantern aft, the standard of Saint Mark on the starboard side aft, and on the mainmast a square ensign of Saint Mark.

He served as commander-in-chief of the sailing fleet and commanded the first division of 9 ships, while the Capitano delle Navi commanded the second, etc.The post of Capitano Straordinario delle Navi was a wartime appointment only. As distinctive signs, his flagship carried a single lantern aft, the standard of Saint Mark on the starboard side aft, and on the mainmast a square ensign of Saint Mark. In peacetime, these were the insignia of the flagship of the Capitano delle Navi. Following the Peace of Passarowitz in 1718, the Venetian navy was reduced in size and limited to its peacetime duties; the only time a Capitano Straordinario delle Navi was appointed again was in 1784, when Angelo Emo was sent to lead a naval expedition against the Beylik of Tunis.

"The Captain of the Gulf (Venetian: Capitan del Golfo; Italian: Capitano in/del Golfo) was a senior naval command of the Republic of Venice. [SEP] The post was established around 1330, when a squadron of ships was set up to patrol the ""Gulf of Venice"" (the Adriatic Sea) and provide protection for commerce there. Neither the squadron nor the post of Captain were permanent in the sense of a modern, standing formation. Every winter, the standing committees of the Great Council of Venice established the annual orders for the so-called ""guard fleet"", or ""fleet of the Gulf"". The Great Council then voted on the proposals, the size of the fleet, and the appointment of a Captain of the Gulf and the captains (sopracomiti) for the galleys to be outfitted in Venice. The commanders of the galleys equipped by Venetian colonies were decided by the local colonists. In the 16th century, the Captain of the Gulf, at the head of a squadron that in peacetime numbered 7 to 12 galleys, patrolled the seas around the Venetian Ionian Islands.In wartime, the Great Council authorized the creation of a fleet under the Captain-General of the Sea, who led the fleet on overseas campaigns, e.g. in the Aegean Sea or the Levant; the Captain of the Gulf and all other naval commanders were then placed under the Captain-General's orders. In battle, the Captain of the Gulf usually commanded one of the wings of the Venetian fleet, or the vanguard.When the Venetian navy acquired ships of the line in the late 17th century, the Captain of the Gulf remained as one of the senior commanders (Capi da Mar) who led the squadrons of the galley fleet (armata sottile), along with the Provveditore d'Armata, the Capitano delle galeazze and the Governatore dei condannati. Towards the end of the Republic, the Captain of the Gulf had his base at Cattaro. Like all Capi da Mar, he hoisted his ensign on a bastard galley, with striped red-and-white sails and tents. As his distinctive signs, the flagship of the Captain of the Gulf carried a single lantern and the standard of Saint Mark on a plain-topped staff aft, and on the foremast a square ensign of Saint Mark.His staff included a chancellor (cancelliere) or a secretary nominated by the Council of Ten, an adjutant (ammiraglio), a quartermaster (sopramasser), and a standard-bearer. For his personal service he had a head of household (maestro di casa), a steward (scalco), a cook (cuoco), a wine steward (canever), and two orderlies (fanti di pizzuol). In addition he had at his disposal a boat (felucca) with twelve boatsmen (caiccheri) and a rowed frigate with a captain (padrone), two steersmen (timonieri), two artillerymen (bombardieri) and 18 rowers (galeotti).

Already as a youth he enlisted in the Venetian navy and participated in the War of the Morea in 1696–1697 as a ship of the line captain (Governator di Nave) under the provveditore Grimani.He was then elected as provveditore straordinario di Terraferma at Orzinuovi in 1701, at Brescia in 1704, and at Bergamo in 1706.In 1717, during the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian War, he was appointed Capitano Straordinario delle Navi (commander of the sailing fleet), replacing Andrea Corner. He thus took over command of 28 ships of the line in three divisions (Red, Yellow, and Blue), 18 galleys, 2 galleasses, 10 galliots, 4 fireships, and 2 corvettes. In addition, Venice's allies in the Holy League provided 7 Portuguese, 5 Papal, and 4 Maltese ships of the line, as well as 5 Spanish, 4 Papal, 3 Maltese, 2 Tuscan, and 2 Genoese galleys. Flangini hoiste dhis ensign on the newly built 70-cannon battleship Leon Trionfante, and on 12 May scored a partial victory at the Battle of Imbros, in which he forced the Ottoman fleet of 42 ships to retreat.Four days later, the two fleets met again in the sea between Mount Athos and the island of Agios Efstratios, and in the ensuing battle, the Venetians defeated the Ottomans. Six Ottoman ships of the line were badly damaged, and the Ottoman fleet suffered 2,500 killed or wounded. As the Ottoman fleet began its retreat, a musket ball hit Flangini in the neck. Heavily wounded, he sailed to Thermia (Kythnos), but again led the Venetian fleet in battle on 22 June, directing the action from the deck of his flagship until he collapsed and died. His final words were reportedly ""Verdè, San Marco ne aiuta"".His body was transported to Venice, where his funeral took place. His brother Constantino received the title of a Knight of the Order of the Golden Stola in his stead.

"The governatore dei condannati (""commander of the convicts"") was a senior commander of the navy of the Republic of Venice.

The post of governatore dei condannati was also created at this time. The use of convicts to row the galleys increased over time, except for the flagships and the galeasses. Finally, as the number of galleys in the Venetian fleet diminished in favour of sailing ships of the line, after 1721 all Venetian galleys were exclusively manned by convicts.Like all squadron commanders of the rowed fleet (armata sottile)—the Provveditore d'Armata, the Capitano delle galeazze, and the Capitano in Golfo—he hoisted his ensign on a bastard galley, with striped red-and-white sails and tents. As his distinctive signs, the flagship of the governatore dei condannati carried a single lantern and the standard of Saint Mark on a plain-topped staff aft, and on the foremast a square ensign of Saint Mark with an egg-shaped tail.His staff included a chancellor (cancelliere) or a secretary nominated by the Council of Ten, an adjutant (ammiraglio), a quartermaster (sopramasser), and a standard-bearer.

He was the son of Gianfrancesco Pisani and Paolina Contarini.During his youth, he was banished from Venice on the orders of the Council of Ten (25 August 1682), for having perpetrated indecent acts against the Sisters of Sant Catherine the Virgin Martyr in Brescia. In order to redeem himself, he enlisted as a volunteer in the Imperial army operating in Hungary during the Siege of Buda. In the next year, he returned to Venice, enlisting in the Venetian navy under the captain (Governator di Nave) Pietro Zaguri.In 1693, he was appointed paymaster under the Doge and Captain General of the Sea Francesco Morosini. In 1695, he took part in the naval Battle of the Oinousses Islands, under the command of Captain General Giovanni Antonio Zeno against the Ottoman fleet, and in the next year he fought in the Battle of Andros under Captain General Alessandro Molin.On his return to Venice he was elected to the Venetian Senate. As senator, he occupied several different magistratures, until returning to military duties in 1715, with the outbreak of the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian War, when he was appointed Provveditore Generale delle Isole, and later Captain General of the Sea. In 1716, he participated in the successful defence of Corfu, and recaptured Butrint and Santa Maura.In 1717, he distinguished himself in the battle off Passavas, along with his brother Carlo: aboard a small felucca, Pisani passed through the enemy ships in full action, reorganized his own ships of the line, and encouraged his troops.

The office usually had a tenure of three years, but in wartime, the nomination of a new Capitano Generale da Mar was usually accompanied also by the election of a new Provveditore Generale. From the first half of the 16th century, he also appears as the governor of the Venetian Ionian Islands. Eventually this appointment became regularized, as the Provveditore Generale del Levante; with his seat at Corfu, the Provveditore Generale da Mar was the senior civil and military governor of the Ionian Islands in peacetime.Typically he hoisted his ensign on a bastard galley, although in later times he was allowed to use a sailing ship of the line instead. As a sign of his command, the poop deck of his vessel bore three lanterns.In wartime, due to his absence at the head of the fleet, he was sometimes replaced by a Provveditore Generale delle Tre Isole (""Superintendent general of the Three Islands""), referring to Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, renamed to Provveditore Generale delle Quattro Isole after the addition of Lefkada to the Venetian domains in 1684.The office was abolished after the Fall of the Republic of Venice and the start of French rule in the Ionian Islands in June 1797.

In 1503, hired by Ferdinand II of Spain, he was determinant in the victory at the Battle of Garigliano over the French army, which started the Spanish domination over southern Italy. At the beginning of 1505 he was employed by the Venetians and was granted a cavalry captaincy by the Senate with an annual pay of 150 gold pounds. In 1507, together with Nicolò Orsini, Bartolomeo was hired by the Republic of Venice. The following year he defeated the Imperial Army of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor in Cadore, at Mauria and Pontebba, conquering Gorizia and Trieste. In the same year Pordenone also fell and the Serenissima assigned its signory to d'Alviano himself (the town was ruled by the d'Alviano family until 1539). In 1509 (the year he began the construction of new city walls at Padua), however, he was crushingly defeated at the Battle of Agnadello, being also wounded in the fray. D'Alviano was charged of the result, as he allegedly attacked the enemy without the authorisation of Orsini, then commander-in-chief. Captured by the French, he remained a prisoner until 1513. In 1513, after the alliance between France and Venice against the Duchy of Milan, he was freed, and later fought under the French commander Louis de la Trémoille. He was defeated at the Battle of Vicenza by the Spanish Viceroy of Naples Ramón de Cardona. Later d'Alviano again conquered, and sacked, Pordenone, which in the meantime had fallen again to the House of Habsburg. He was subsequently a protagonist of the French victory at the Battle of Marignano(September 1515), in which he attacked the Swiss mercenaries with a corps of only 300 knights. Later he managed to conquer also Bergamo, but died in October of the same year during the siege of Brescia.He was buried in the church of Santo Stefano in Venice.

In 1527 he was able to obtain the seignory of Perugia, after eliminating his brother and his uncle. During the War of the League of Cognac, Malatesta left Perugia to Philibert of Orange, chief of the Imperial army in Italy, to assume the defence of the Republic of Florence. A secret agreement with Pope Clement VII and the Imperials stated that he would receive the city back after his condotta for Florence ended. His treason was revealed on 3 August 1530, at the Battle of Gavinana, in which the Florentine force under Francesco Ferrucci was destroyed by the Imperial army. Ferrucci's exclamation: ""Ahi traditor Malatesta!"" has remained famous. Baglioni was thus able to return to Perugia on 20 September. He died in Bettona the following year.   "
"Gianfrancesco I Gonzaga (1395 – 23 September 1444) was Marquess of Mantua from 1407 to 1444. [SEP] He was also a condottiero.    Gianfrancesco was the son of Francesco I Gonzaga and Margherita Malatesta.  He inherited the rule of Mantua in 1407, when he was 12. In his first years, he was under the patronage of his uncle Carlo Malatesta and, indirectly, of the Republic of Venice. In 1409 he married Paola Malatesta, daughter of Malatesta IV Malatesta of Pesaro, by whom he had two sons, Ludovico, who succeeded him as Marquess of Mantua, and Carlo. He was the first Gonzaga to bear the title of marquess, which he obtained from Emperor Sigismund on 22 September 1433.He fought for the Papal States and the Malatestas in 1412 and 1417, respectively, and was capitano generale (commander-in-chief) of the Venetian Armies from 1434. Later he left the alliance with Venice and entered at the service of the Visconti of Milan, starting an unsuccessful war against Venice which caused the loss of several Mantuan territories. During his reign the famous humanist Vittorino da Feltre was invited to Mantua, as well as numerous artists like Pisanello and others, starting the traditional role of the city as a capital of Italian Renaissance. He founded the first workshop in Italy for the manufacture of tapestries. Cecilia Gonzaga, his daughter, was a humanist and scholar who received instruction from Vittorino. He pushed for his daughter to marry Oddantonio da Montefeltro, the first duke of Urbino, but renounced the arrangement later when the Duke turned out to be a cruel ruler.   "
"Don Giovanni de' Medici (13 May 1567, in Florence – 19 July 1621, in Murano) was an Italian military commander, diplomat and architect. [SEP] Medici was born the illegitimate son of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and of Eleonora of Albizzi. Medici was later legitimated by his father. He was born 5 years after the death of his brother, Giovanni, and was given the same name. He moved to Spain where he began his military career. In 1598 he was a Grandee of Spain and Florentine ambassador in Madrid. In 1600 he was Master of the Field for the Imperial army, but his most important appointment was as Commander-in-Chief of the army of the Republic of Venice (1616–1617). He married Livia del Vernazza, with whom he had two sons; Gianfrancesco Maria (1619–1689) and another that was born posthumously but died as an infant. Giovanni was also a painter and an architect, and collaborated with Matteo Nigetti in the design of the Principi Chapel for the church of San Lorenzo in Florence. On his return home he caught the smallpox at Padova. He died at Murano in 1621.    Don Giovanni took special care in dealing with artists, he was an architect, he designed the construction of the Chapel of the Princes and the Church of San Lorenzo, but he also had a special relationship with the commedia dell'arte, in fact from 1612 to 1621 he oversaw relations with the comedy troupe of Confidenti, with whom he had extensive correspondence with famous comedians Flaminio Scala and Nicholas Barbieri Beltrame in art, as with other patrons such as Gonzaga and the owners of theatres in which Confidenti had to act.

"Nolfo da Montefeltro (born Sighinolfo; c. 1290 – 1364) was count of Montefeltro from 1323 to 1360. [SEP] He was the son of Federico I da Montefeltro, who had been slain by the people of the city in revolt against him.  In 1323 Nolfo, now a leader of the Ghibelline part in the Marche, reconquered the city by defeating the Papal commander, Ferrantino Malatesta. His first move as lord was the assassination of all his father's enemies.  In 1333 he was named advisor by John of Bohemia and captain of the Papal Army. Nolfo annexed Borgo San Sepolcro and the fortress of San Leo, and was hired as condottiero by the Pisane, for which he occupied Lucca in 1342. In 1348 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Republic of Venice's army against the counts of Gorizia; he was also made imperial vicar of the county of Urbino. In 1351 he was hired by Giovanni Visconti, lord of Milan. The following year he captured Cagli, but was pushed back in 1354 by the Papal commander Gil de Albornoz, sent in Italy to reconquer the fractionated Papal States.  After signing a treaty of peace, he was made Papal vicar in his lands. Nolfo died in 1364.   "
"Niccolò di Pitigliano (1442–1510) was an Italian condottiero best known as the Captain-General of the Venetians during the Most Serene Republic's war against the League of Cambrai. [SEP] He was a member of the powerful feudal family of the Orsini, belonging to its Pitigliano line.       Niccolò di Pitigliano was born in Pitigliano, in the Maremma, the son of Aldobrandino Paioletti ll,  Count of Pitigliano and his wife Bartolomea. He was the descendant of a Romano [""Romanello""] Orsini, Count of Nola, who had acquired the Signoria of the tiny Tuscan citystate  of Pitigliano in 1293 by marrying Anastasia de Montfort, heiress of the Aldobrandeschi Lords of the city. His parents both came from different branches of the Orsini clan. Equipped with the reputation that comes from a famous name, the connections and dynastic links with many of the ruling families of Italy, and with their own private fief as a base, both Niccolò Paioletti, and his father Aldobrandino Paioletti made careers as mercenaries taking Condotte (mercenary contracts) with Florence, Siena, the Pope, and the Kingdom of Naples at various times.    A chronological list of the Niccolò di Pitigliano's early contracts shows him moving among the same employers and taking service with the same State more than once. Niccolò di Pitigliano's significant Condotte were as follows:  1458 – Papacy 1463 – Kingdom of Naples 1473 – Florence, with the rank of Field Marshal of the Republic 1481 – Kingdom of Naples 1482 – Papacy 1485 – Florence, with the rank of Captain General of the Republic (Florence's highest military rank) 1489 – Papacy, as Captain General of the Church 1495 – Venice    From 1495 until the end of his life Niccolò di Pitigliano remained in Venetian service as Governatore Generale delle Milizie Veneziane (Governor General of Venetian Forces). The highpoint of his career was the role that he played in the War between the Venetian Republic and the League of Cambrai. In the first decade of the sixteenth century Pope Julius II planned to curb the power of Venice in northern Italy and had, to this end, created the League of Cambrai (named after Cambrai, where the negotiations took place), an alliance against the Republic that included, besides himself, Louis XII of France, Emperor Maximilian I, and Ferdinand I of Spain. On 15 April 1509, King Louis XII of France left Milan at the head of a French army and moved rapidly into Venetian territory. To oppose him, Venice fielded an army under the command of Niccolò di Pitigliano and his cousin Bartolomeo d'Alviano (also a scion of the Orsini clan). Disagreements between Pitigliano and Alviano as the best way to stop the French advance prevented the two from uniting their forces to oppose the French. Consequently, when Louis crossed the Adda River in early May and Alviano advanced to meet him, Pitigliano, believing it best to avoid a pitched battle, moved away to the south. On 14 May, Alviano confronted the French at the Battle of Agnadello; outnumbered, he sent requests for reinforcements to his cousin, who replied with orders to break off the battle and continued on his way. Alviano, disregarding the new orders, continued the engagement; his army was eventually surrounded and destroyed. Pitigliano managed to avoid encountering Louis; but his mercenary troops, hearing of Alviano's defeat, had deserted in large numbers by the next morning, forcing him to retreat to Treviso with the remnants of the Venetian army.The Venetian collapse was complete; Louis proceeded to occupy Venetian territory as far east as Brescia without encountering any significant resistance. The major cities that had not been occupied by the French—Padua, Verona, and Vicenza—were left undefended by Pitigliano's withdrawal, and quickly surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries arrived in the Veneto.    Julius, having in the meantime issued an interdict against Venice that excommunicated every citizen of the Republic, invaded the Romagna and seized Ravenna with the assistance of the Duke of Ferrara, who had joined the League and seized the Polesine for himself.The newly arrived Imperial governors, however, quickly proved to be unpopular.  In mid-July, the citizens of Padua, aided by detachments of Venetian cavalry under the command of the proveditor Andrea Gritti, revolted; the landsknechts garrisoning the city were too few in number to mount effective resistance and  Padua was restored to Venetian control on 17 July.The success of the revolt finally pushed Maximilian into action. In early August, a massive Imperial army, accompanied by bodies of French and Spanish troops, set out from Trento into the Veneto.  Because of a lack of horses, as well as general disorganization, Maximilian's forces would not reach Padua until September, giving Pitigliano the time to concentrate such troops as were still available to him in the city. The Siege of Padua began on 15 September; although French and Imperial artillery successfully breached Padua's walls, the defenders managed to hold the city until Maximilian, growing impatient, lifted the siege on 30 September and withdrew to Tyrol with the main part of his army.In mid-November, Pitigliano returned to the offensive; Venetian troops easily defeated the remaining Imperial forces, capturing Vicenza, Este, Feltre, and Belluno. Although a subsequent attack on Verona failed, Pitigliano managed to destroy a Papal army under Francesco II of Gonzaga in the process. A river attack on Ferrara by the Venetian galley fleet under Angelo Trevisan failed, however, when the Venetian ships, anchored in the Po River, were sunk by Ferrarese artillery; and a new French advance soon forced Pitigliano to withdraw to Padua once again. The War of the League of Cambrai continued, but in January 1510 Niccolò di Pitigliano died in Lonigo. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges.    Niccolò di Pitigliano was married twice. Firstly, in 1467, to Elena dei Conti Montalcino (died in Nola in 1504), with nine children including:  Francesca (born 1469, died 1562), who married Don Sigismondo Carafa, Prince of Aliano in 1500 Ludovico (died 1534) who succeeded him as Count of Pitigliano.His connection with the Carafa family is shown by his presence in the Dispute of St. Thomas painted by Filippino Lippi in the Carafa Chapel, in the basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. Secondly to Guglielmina, a commoner of humble birth, last attested to in a will of 1529.   "
"Roberto Sanseverino d'Aragona (1418 – 10 August 1487) was an Italian condottiero, count of Colorno from 1458 to 1477 and count of Caiazzo from 1460 until his death in 1487. [SEP]    He was the son of Leonetto Sanseverino (d. 1420) and of Elisa Sforza, sister of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan. He was granted the surname d'Aragona by the king of Naples, Ferdinand of Aragon. He acted as a general in the service of his uncle, the duke of Milan during the 1440s and 1450s.  He went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1458. On his return, he went to the aid of the king of Naples against the Neapolitan barons during (the first congiura dei baroni or ""Conspiracy of the Barons"", 1459 to 1462) He then passed into the service of Florence against Venice, participating in the battle of Molinella in 1467 In 1471, he again entered the service of Milan, now under Galeazzo Maria Sforza.  Together with the duke of Savoy he fought in the Burgundian Wars against Charles the Bold in 1476 but was forced to return to Milan upon the assassination of Galeazzo Maria Sforza. He made an enemy of Bona of Savoy's counsellor Cicco Simonetta and was forced into exile together with Ludovico Sforza, and was condemned to death by beheading in absentia and his goods were confiscated and given to Ercole d'Este. He then became captain-general of the Republic of Genoa, fighting against Milan in 1478, but in 1479 he was permitted to return to Milan following the reconciliation of Ludovico with Bona. His goods were returned to him along with his fiefs in Lugano, Balerna and Mendrisio. In 1482, he was hired by Venice and fought in the War of Ferrara.  With the peace of Bagnolo of 7 August 1484, Sanseverino was elected captain-general of the Italian League for nine years, on an annual salary of 120,000 ducats. In October 1485, he was given leave by the Venetians to fight the Aragonese and their allies in the  service of the Holy See. This military campaign proved to be a failure, and dismissed by the Pope, Roberto fled back to Venice, where he returned to command the Venetian troops against Sigismund of Habsburg. In the  Battle of Calliano of 10 August 1487, Roberto Sanseverino was wounded, fell into the river and drowned. His body was recovered, brought to Trento and buried in a solemn funeral in the cathedral crypt. His remains were later transferred to the church of San Francesco in Milan.

"Marshal Johann Matthias Reichsgraf von der Schulenburg (8 August 1661 – 14 March 1747) was a German aristocrat and general of Brandenburg-Prussian background who served in the Saxon and Venetian armies in the early 18th  century and found a second career in retirement in Venice, as a grand collector and patron. [SEP] His sister was Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal. His father was Gustavus Adolphus, Baron von der Schulenburg.    Schulenburg was born in Emden near Magdeburg. Between 1687 and 1688 Schulenburg fought with the Imperial troops against the Turks in Hungary. On his return he rose in the ranks of the army of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1699 he became a Colonel in the German regiment in the service of Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, and was severely wounded in 1701. In 1702 he joined the Saxon Army and fought in the Great Northern War against Charles XII of Sweden and suffered defeats in the Battle of Klissow and the Battle of Fraustadt. In 1707 he returned to Western Europe and fought under Prince Eugene of Savoy at the Battle of Oudenaarde and the Battle of Malplaquet in the wars of Spanish Succession. The latter service brought him to the attention of Venice. He was recruited by Venice into the successful defence of Ulcinj in 1711 and five years later Corfu during the 1716 siege against the same invading Ottoman Turks; he was decorated by the Serenissima for his outstanding success with a statue and a pension of 5000 ducats a year. A Vivaldi opera, Juditha triumphans, was commissioned in celebration of the victory.     In his retirement in Venice from 1718, the Reichsgraf von der Schulenburg proved a remarkable collector of art while residing in the Palazzo Loredan on the Grand Canal of Venice. The Reichsgraf began as a serious collector in 1724, at the age of sixty-three, with a purchase of eighty-eight paintings and a bas-relief by Pierre Puget from a Venetian picture-dealer, Santi Rota, who had obtained them from the collection of Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga, the last ruler of the Duchy of Mantua, deposed by Habsburg Austrian empire; Gonzaga's works of art included works by Raphael, Correggio, Giorgione, Giulio Romano, and Castiglione. In addition Schulenburg had access to many royal families, including the Hanoverians, Bourbons, and Habsburgs; and served them as an intermediary and bon-vivant host in the Venetian republic. His portrait was painted by Bartolomeo Nazari, Giuseppe Nogari, Giacomo Ceruti, Gian Antonio Guardi (in Ca' Rezzonico), Francesco Simonini, and Piazzetta, and he was sculpted by Antonio Corradini and Gian Maria Morlaiter. Schulenburg supported Gian Antonio Guardi with a monthly salary, 1730–36, and on a commission basis thereafter. In general, Guardi worked at making portraits of foreign aristocracy and royalty to impressively adorn the walls at Ca' Loredan, and at copying masterpieces of the Venetian past including works of Paolo Veronese and Tintoretto. Francesco Simonini was commissioned to produce a series of paintings commemorating Schulenburg's battles. Canaletto painted a view of Corfu, the site of his victories. He also employed Giambattista Pittoni, 1733–38, for history paintings, and as advisor and restorer. Finally, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta had a close relationship with the Marshal, both as painter as an agent for buying both Flemish and genre paintings, two types of works popular with Schulenburg; Piazzetta made an inventory of the collection in 1739. Schulenburg's paintings were mainly Italian works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with some Flemish and Dutch paintings. He owned six paintings by Giacomo Ceruti. He owned vedute by Michele Marieschi, Luca Carlevaris, Giovanni Battista Cimaroli, Antonio Joli, Marco Ricci, and Francesco Zuccarelli; thus he overlapped to some degree with the collecting of the contemporary British ambassador, Joseph Smith. Many of his works were transferred to his estates in Germany, like Emden, Hehlen and Beetzendorf. Schulenburg did not have children and, though he willed his collection en bloc to his nephew Count Adolf Friedrich von der Schulenburg-Beetzendorf with the stipulation that they be kept together, in the Palais Schulenburg in Berlin, his will was not honoured, and after his death his collection was dispersed. A distinguished customer was Frederick II of Prussia. A group of 150 pieces were sold at auction in London in April 1775.   "
"Taddeo d'Este (ca. 1390 – 21 June 1448) was a condottiere, a freelance military leader, who was known for his defense of the Republic of Venice in 1439 against Milanese forces under Niccolò Piccinino. [SEP]  Unlike many other condottieri of the day, who often changed sides, he served Venice almost exclusively throughout his thirty-year military career. During most of this period Venice was constantly at war with one or more of the neighboring states in northern Italy.    Taddeo d'Este was born around the last decade of the fourteenth century in Este, the second son of Obizzo II d'Este, of the younger branch of the family that ruled Ferrara. His mother belonged to the noble family of Collalto. Taddeo became a mercenary at an early age, fighting for Venice, and gave the republic his loyalty for the next thirty years during the wars in which the city struggled to gain territory in the Terraferma, on the mainland.  However, he was never given independent command for any length of time.    Taddeo d'Este was active in the struggle for territory between Venice and the Patriarch of Aquileia. In 1414 Taddeo led a squad of fifteen lances (cavalrymen) in a fight at Zadar against the armies of Sigismund of Luxembourg. The next year he was given permission to return to Este to look after family affairs, since his father had just died. When the truce with Sigismund broke down, in April 1417 he was sent back at the head of 50 lances.  In September 1418 he was leading a force of 70 lances in the village of Brugnera, a defensive position along the Treviso-Udine line. In November 1419, with 100 horsemen, he was sent to defend Cividale del Friuli against Hungarian troops under Louis of Teck, the Patriarch of Aquileia.  He organized the defense successfully, then managed to break out and defeat the Hungarians in open battle. By the end of the month he was able to raise the Venetian banner over the castles of Gorizia and Duino.By June 1420 most of Friuli had been conquered and another truce had been arranged with Sigismund. Taddeo returned on leave to Venice and in September married Magdalene, daughter of Filippo Arcelli, governor general of the Friuli army.  He was required to return to Friuli immediately after his marriage. In January 1421 he was dispatched to Istria.  When Arcelli became ill and retired to Padua to regain his health, d'Este was appointed commander of the troops.  After recovering, Arcelli returned to Istria and resumed command, but was wounded in battle and died in July 1421.  Taddeo d'Este again took command. He damaged the castle of Sanvincenti to the east of Rovigno. He took the Pietrapelosa castle in Istria in August 1421 and during the next few months defeated the army of Aquileia; Istria became divided between the Republic of Venice and the Habsburg County of Pazin.Although Taddeo d'Este was recognized as the most senior of the commanders after Arcelli's death, he was not officially the leader.  By the autumn of 1421 the Venetian republic had imposed economy measures on the army, reducing troop levels to their lowest in a long time, with only 400 cavalry. However, in May 1422 an increase in forces was allowed.     By early 1422 the conquest of Istria was complete.  Taddeo returned home, retaining some of his men but not engaging in warfare for several years.  He used the time to reorganize his estates and to buy houses and land in the Este countryside and the city of Padua. In March 1426 a new conflict broke out between Venice and Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan.  Taddeo was asked to lead a company of 100 lances. He was one of the first to enter the fortress of Brescia when it was captured. When the peace of Ferrara in April 1428 brought temporary peace, for a while Taddeo fought in the service of the Pope, helping with the recapture of Bologna.In 1431 Taddeo d'Este was again fighting for the republic against the Patriarch of Aquileia, who with the encouragement of Milan had raised a force of over 6,000 German and Hungarian troops with which to try to recover part of his former domain. Taddeo was sent to Friuli, where he engaged in defensive actions against superior forces until the main Venetian force arrived and decisively and permanently defeated the partiarch at Rosazzo. In November 1432 Taddeo d'Este was defeated in Lombardy, captured and taken to Milan. He was released in April of the next year in exchange for a huge ransom after peace had been arranged between Venice and Milan.  The Venetians confirmed Taddeo as leader of 200 cavalry and gave him command of the garrison of Orzi Nuovi in Lombardy. In May 1434 his son Bertoldo was born, destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a soldier for Venice.In August 1434 Taddeo d'Este was engaged in fighting in Romagna with the troops of Bologna, and was taken prisoner, being released after the intervention of the Marquess of Ferrara. In March 1435 he was given the task of foiling an attempt by Marsilio da Carrara to capture Padua.  After he had succeeded, in April 1435 he was admitted to the ranks of the Venetian nobility, with his children and heirs, and admitted to the Great Council of Venice. The Venetians awarded him a palace in their city of Padua.     In 1438 war with Milan broke out again.  Taddeo d'Este and Francesco Barbero conducted a long and gallant defense of Brescia against Milanese troops under Piccinino. Gattamelata broke out, making a skilled escape via mountain routes, leaving Taddeo with just 1,000 men to conduct the defense.  The siege of Brescia lasted until December 1438, when Gattamelata made a feint that drew Piccinino away. The fighting continued, and in September 1439 d'Este was forced to surrender to greatly superior forces and was imprisoned in Peschiera.In 1441 d'Este was back in Venice attending the celebrations of the marriage of Jacopo, son of Doge Francesco Foscari. In the Piazza San Marco his company competed for lavish prizes in lengthy tournaments with the companies of the condottieri Francesco Sforza and Gattamelata.His first wife having died, he married again in 1442 to Margherita Pio. In the 1440s Leonello and Taddeo d'Este were challenged by the canons of S. Giacomo, Monselice, who claimed they had been levying tithes in the parish of S. Maria, Solesino, by force for several years.In June 1443 Taddeo d'Este was commanded to take his company of 800 cavalry to Ravenna, where he placed himself under the command of Francesco Sforza, then serving as captain general of the anti-Papal league. In June 1445, acting as commander of the army but without the formal title, Taddeo was sent to Bologna with 1,000 cavalry and 400 infantry. The next year he managed to arrange for a part of the Bolognese forces to transfer to Venice, and after some further fighting was able to bring the war with Bologna to a close. He then had to return to Lombardy where a renewed struggle with Milan had begun.In 1447 d'Este seized and held Piacenza for Venice.  He defended the town with 2,000 lances, 2,000 infantry and 6,000 armed citizens. The town was besieged by Milanese forces under Francesco Sforza.  In addition to Sforza's men the Milanese army had 10,000 soldiers and the condottieri under leaders such as Francesco Piccinino, Guidaccio Manfredi, Luigi dal Verme and others had 15,000 cavalry and infantry. The walls were broken down by cannon fire, and flooding of the river Po meant that boats could approach the city walls. After fierce fighting, Taddeo d'Este, Alberto Scotto and the Venetian governor Gherardo Dandolo were forced to surrender and were taken captive. The town was thrown open to pillage and the inhabitants were treated with great cruelty. Due to his personal friendship with Sforza, d'Este was soon released.Taddeo d'Este died suddenly while attempting to take Mozzanica on 21 June 1448. His state funeral was held in Brescia. His body was returned to Este, where it was buried in the family tomb in the church of S. Francesco. His male line died out in 1463.   "

"Manuel Bochalis (Albanian: Manuel Bokali, Greek:  ) was an Albanian military commander in the service of the Despotate of the Morea and the Republic of Venice. [SEP] He was a son-in-law of the mesazon George Palaiologos. In 1453 he was governor of Leontari in Arcadia, but in the Morea revolt of 1453–1454 he fought against the Despot Thomas Palaiologos, was defeated and blinded. In 1459, during the civil war between Thomas Palaiologos and his brother and co-despot, Demetrios Palaiologos, Bochalis sided with the latter. Along with his father-in-law he captured Leontari, the capital of Thomas Palaiologos, but was forced to abandon the town, incurring many casualties, once Thomas arrived with his army.During the Ottoman invasion of the Despotate in 1460, Bochalis led the defence of Gardiki Castle, where the inhabitants of Leontari had fled. When the Ottomans arrived, Sultan Mehmed II offered terms, but Bochalis rejected them. However, the crowd of refugees, some 6,000, made a prolonged resistance impossible: in the extreme heat of summer, water and supplies were quickly consumed, and after only a day of resistance to the Ottoman assault, Bochalis surrendered in exchange for promises of safety. Despite the promise to not harm, them, Mehmed ordered all defenders, including women and children, executed. Bochalis and his family were saved thanks to the intervention of Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha Angelović, who was second cousin to Bochalis' wife. With Mahmud's aid, Bochalis and his family, including his father-in-law George Palaiologos, were escorted away, killed their Ottoman guards and escaped to Corfu, from where they moved to the Kingdom of Naples.During the First Ottoman–Venetian War, Bochalis returned to fight for the Republic of Venice in the Morea, but was captured in 1468 by the Ottomans at Kalamata and executed by impalement.

"Emmanuel or Manolis Mormoris (Greek:  ) was a 16th-century Greek noble, rebel and military leader of the Republic of Venice. [SEP] He was the military commander of a Greek revolt in Ottoman-ruled Epirus during the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1570-1573.    The Mormoris family was one of the noble Greek families that originated from Nauplion, southern Greece. After the Ottoman conquest of the city (1540) a branch escaped to the Venetian-controlled island of Crete. Various members of the family participated in the armed struggles against the Ottoman Empire. The father of Emmanuel Mormoris, Jacomo, was a cavaliere in the Venetian army and commander of the Stratioti units of Crete.Shortly before 1570 Emmanuel Mormoris was sent by the Venetian provveditore generale (governor-general) of Crete to Sfakia, a region in western Crete, to convince some local rebel to submit to Venetian rule.     During the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1570-1573 Mormoris took action in the region of Epirus.  As soon as military operations began, Mormoris proposed the capture of the coastal fortress of Sopot across Corfu. After a successful siege on June 7, 1570, Mormoris was appointed commander of the fortress and the surrounding region.The capture of this strategic location triggered a general revolt under the leadership of Mormoris. Soon after the anti-Ottoman movement was spread to the adjacent regions of Argyrokastron (modern Gjirokastër), Delvina and Parga with the military guidance of the local Greek nobility and a number of Stratioti, such as Petros Lantzas and Georgios Renesis. In addition, the inhabitants of nearby Himara also supported the uprising and submitted voluntarily to Venetian rule, while making use of the advantageous mountainous terrain of their homeland.Mormoris proceeded the siege of the coastal fortress of Nivice. After operations lasting a year, it was finally taken in spring 1571. Mormoris was assisted by his brother Zorzis Mormoris, who commanded units of Stratioti in Margariti, Santa Maura (Lefkada), and Corfu. However, due to the developments of the ongoing Ottoman-Venetian War, Venice withdrew its support to the rebels. Thus, during the Ottoman counter-offensive the revolutionaries had to lift the siege of Kardhiq. Sopot was recaptured by the Ottomans at the same year (1571).Emmanuel Mormoris was captured during the Ottoman advance and taken prisoner to Constantinople. He was released in June 1575 during a prisoner exchange between the Venetian and Ottoman authorities.    At 1583 Mormoris, already promoted to colonel, was placed in command of the Venetian infantry units in Crete. In 1590-1591 he was sent to Italy to suppress the revolt of the lord of Montemarciano, Alfonso Picollomini. The latter was executed in March 1591. The following year he returned to Crete to deal with various rebellions in the island. In the summer of 1593 he was placed in Kefallonia where he supervised the construction of the Venetian fortress in Asos.   "
"Petros Lantzas (Greek:  ; died 1608) was a Greek rebel, spy, and privateer. [SEP] He initially worked for the Republic of Venice and from 1574 was employed by the Spanish Empire. Lantzas was involved in various plots to overthrow Ottoman rule in Greek-inhabited regions. In 1608 he devised a plan for the assassination of the Ottoman Sultan by placing a present containing explosives in front of him.    Petros Lantzas was born on the island of Corfu, then part of the Republic of Venice (but now in Greece). During the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1570-1573 he supported the rebellion of Emmanuel Mormoris in Ottoman-ruled Epirus. As such, Lantzas made preparatory skirmishes and raided Turkish ships in the regions of Lepanto and Preveza. He also attacked inland regions and penetrated as far as Delvinë. At the end of the war (1573) he was appointed governor of the coastal town of Parga, opposite of Corfu, by the Venetians.However, in 1574 Lantzas was dismissed from office and banished by the Venetian authorities. Though the reason for this turn of events is not clear, an anonymous letter sent to the local Venetian provveditore (governor-general) alleged that Lantzas was ostensibly buying munitions from the Spanish to allow the locals to defend themselves against the Turks, but according to the letter he was in fact selling these munitions to the Turks for his own profit. The letter goes on to ask for Lantzas to be assassinated. Meanwhile, being unhappy with the Venetian–Ottoman peace settlement, he transferred to Spanish service. He served the Viceroy of Naples and became a notable member of the Greek community of Naples.    Venice decided to sue for a unilateral peace with the Ottomans in 1573. As a result, the Greek collaborators of the Venetians and their agents in Corfu and the Ottoman Empire turned to the Kingdom of Naples, then part of the Spanish Empire. On the other hand, Spain actively encouraged insurrections against the Ottoman Empire and acceded to the petitions of a number of rebels and potential rebels.In the following years Lantzas served the Spanish as a corsair and spy. In July 1576 he went to Himara, where the local population was willing to raise a revolt against Ottoman rule. As part of this Lantzas, together with the rebels from Himara, led an attack against the nearby Ottoman fortress of Sopot, but did not meet with success.Lantzas' assignment was to supervise the military movements of the Ottomans, as well as those of the Venetians, and to direct the shipment of weapons, provisions, spies, and saboteurs who were sent repeatedly to Epirus, the Ottoman capital of Constantinople, and other parts of the Ottoman Empire. He led pirate raids against Ottoman ships, while from 1577 he began attacking Venetian ships, thus creating diplomatic tensions between Habsburg Spain and Venice. This activity aroused the wrath of Venice, which attempted to assassinate him. As a result of this activity Lantzas was dismissed from his post as the captain of the royal frigates in 1578, though he continued to serve the Viceroys of Naples until the first decade of the 17th century.In 1578, under the guidance of Lantzas, plans were proposed to the Viceroy of Naples and the Spanish king Philip II for a military intervention in favor of a Greek insurrection in Cyprus, which had been occupied by the Ottomans since 1571. In August 1596 Lantzas supported another revolt in Himara led by the archbishop of Ohrid, Athanasios Rizeas.Later, Lantzas proposed to engage in a number of clandestine operations by moving to Constantinople. In 1608 he devised a plan to assassinate the Ottoman Sultan by placing a present containing explosives in front of him.Lantzas died in 1608 during a trip to Ragusa on the Adriatic shore.      "
"Marcantonio Diedo (fl.1728), (or Marco Antonio Diedo) was a Venetian naval commander who served as Supreme Governor of the Island of Corfu and as Provveditore Generale da Mar 1728-31 (""Superintendent General of the Sea"")). He served as commander of the Venetian fleet (Capitano delle Navi (""Captain of the Ships"")) in the Battle of Imbros (June 1717) and Battle of Matapan (July 1717) against the Ottoman Fleet.     Diedo is memorialised on a 1728 Venetian monument affixed to the Defensive Wall of the New Fortress of Corfu Town, displaying above the Lion of Saint Mark (the symbol of Venice) and the arms of Diedo.

"Giovanni Renesi (Albanian: Gjon Renësi, 1567-) was an Albanian military captain and mercenary. [SEP] He was involved in the organization of spy networks in the Ottoman Empire in support of the Catholic powers of southern Europe and he participated in several plans for large-scale revolts against the Ottomans.    Giovanni Renesi was born around 1567 in the town of Zara (modern Zadar). He came from an Albanian Catholic family, which belonged to the Renesi fis of Lezha in northern Albania. They had settled in Zara as refugees after the Ottoman conquest of Albania and joined the stradioti regiments of Venice like many other Albanian refugees in Dalmatia. His family had produced many military captains, administrators and governors in the Stato da Màr. His father and his brother were both military commanders of the Venetian Republic. Renesi served the Venetian Republic as a stradiot until 1607, when he was banished from the Venetian Republic for murder in a blood feud. Following these events, Renesi would regularly inform the Venetians of his future activities, which he probably did in the hope that they would lift the ban pending on him. A Venetian report in 1617-18 describes him as man of pale skin colour who had a lean body, a black beard and who dressed in ""French style"" (alla francese).    At the beginning of 1607, Renesi was in Turin and met with Carlo Emanuele I of Savoy. He proposed to the duke to take part in a rebellion against the Ottoman Turks, which was promoted by the voivode Grdan of Nikšić and the patriarch Jovan II of Peć. Near the end of 1607 and beginning of 1608, Renesi participated in a mission in Mljet, led by Carlo Emanuele who sent out spies to the island and to Ragusa with the intention of supporting rebel leaders who had gathered in order to oppose Ottoman rule. Renesi had as role to negotiate directly with the leaders of the possible uprising rebels.At the end of the summer of 1608, Renesi arrived in Dalmatia with the envoys of Carlo Emanuele, and informed Grdan about the duke's decision in relation to their previously planned rebellion. Carlo Emmanuele assured his support for the uprising for the months of January or February 1609, depending on the weather conditions. However, the intervention announced by Carlo Manuele for January-February 1609 did not take place and the duke lost all interest in the Balkans. Renesi together with the other representatives of the uprising villages, were forced to seek support from another prince, the Duke of Mantua, Vincenzo I Gonzaga.Renesi arrived in Mantua at the end of 1609, accompanied by a Dutch merchant and two noblemen from Ragusa. They presented the plan to the duke and informed him that Maurice of Nassau was also desiring to participate in it. The talks with the Duke of Mentua prevailed until his death on February 18, 1612. Later in the same year, Renesi went to Milan to propose to another governor, Marquis de la Hinojosa, the undertaking of the uprising in Montenegro and Albania. Renesi tried to convince the duke by offering him, in case of victory, two of the most important strongholds in the region. Hinojosa encouraged Renesi to go to the court of Madrid as ambassador of the Albanians and the Serbs.Renesi sent a letter to the bishop of Vigevano Lombardy who relayed it to the Spanish court in Madrid where Renesi asked for military support for the uprising.In 1614, Renesi was in Parma, to propose the Duke Ranuccio I Farnese to assume leadership of the rebellion. Farnese sent him in the Balkans with money. On July 14 during the Convention of Kuçi, Renesi informed the local leaders of the Duke of Parma's support for their plans and they accepted to recognize Farnese as their lord. These plans were abandoned when he returned to Italy as internal European conflicts stopped any plans for a future campaign against the Ottoman Empire. On August 1615, the pretender to the Ottoman throne, Sultan Yahya, and the Duke of Nevres met in Paris. Renesi was also present and Sultan Yahya gave him a decree of appointment addressed to the archbishops, nobles and leaders of the Balkans. In the decree Renesi was presented as Sultan Yahya’s ambassador and was authorized to negotiate in his name. The Duke of Nevres gave Renesi a passport which allowed him to travel freely. Renesi left Paris on April 1616, with orders to meet with the Dukes of Tuscany and Mantua before going to the Balkans.In 1617, on Farnese’s request, Renesi went to Madrid. Farnese ordered his ambassador to Spain, Flavio Atti, to meet with the Duke of Lerma, the secretary Antonio de Aróstegui, the Marquis of Hinojosa and with the confessor of King Filipe II. During the meeting, Renesi told Hinjora that there were many provinces involved in the uprising and he explained to him that they were inhabited by Albanians and Slavs, and not by Greeks. Hinojosa offered to undertake the uprising in a union with Rome and Venice. Renesi argued that the undertaking of the rebellion would involve the initial costs of two armies and 12,000 soldiers. The negotiations at the Spanish court lasted until the end of October 1617, but no results were achieved.   "
"Christine de Pizan or Pisan (French pronunciation: [kʁistin də pizɑ] (listen)), born Cristina da Pizzano (1364 – c. 1430), was a poet and author at the court of King Charles VI of France and several French dukes. [SEP] Venetian by birth, Christine served as a court writer in medieval France after the death of her husband. Christine's patrons included dukes Louis I of Orleans, Philip the Bold, and John the Fearless. Her best known works include The Book of the City of Ladies and The Treasure of the City of Ladies, both written when she worked for John the Fearless of Burgundy. Her books of advice to princesses, princes, and knights remained in print until the 16th century. In recent decades, Christine's work has been returned to prominence by the efforts of scholars Charity Cannon Willard, Earl Jeffrey Richards, Suzanne Solente, Mathilde Laigle and Marie-Josephe Pinet.    Christine de Pizan was born in 1364 in Venice, Italy. She was the daughter of Tommaso di Benvenuto da Pizzano. Her father became known as Thomas de Pizan, named for the family's origins in the town of Pizzano, southeast of Bologna. Her father worked as a physician, court astrologer and Councillor of the Republic of Venice. Thomas de Pizan accepted an appointment to the court of Charles V of France as the king's astrologer and in 1368 Christine moved to Paris. In 1379 Christine de Pizan married the notary and royal secretary Etienne du Castel.She had three children. Her daughter became a nun at the Dominican Abbey in Poissy in 1397 as a companion to the King's daughter Marie. Christine's husband died of the plague in 1389, and her father had died the year before. Christine was left to support her mother and her children. When she tried to collect money from her husband's estate, she faced complicated lawsuits regarding the recovery of salary due her husband. On 4 June 1389, in a judgment concerning a lawsuit filed against her by the archbishop of Sens and François Chanteprime, councillors of the King, Christine was styled ""damoiselle"" and widow of ""Estienne du Castel"".    In order to support herself and her family, Christine turned to writing. By 1393, she was writing love ballads, which caught the attention of wealthy patrons within the court. Christine became a prolific writer. Her involvement in the production of her books and her skillful use of patronage in turbulent political times has earned her the title of the first professional woman of letters in Europe. Although Italian by birth, Christine expressed a fervent nationalism for France. Affectively and financially she became attached to the French royal family, donating or dedicating her early ballads to its members, including Isabeau of Bavaria, Louis I, Duke of Orléans, and Marie of Berry. Of Queen Isabeau she wrote in 1402 ""High, excellent crowned Queen of France, very redoubtable princess, powerful lady, born at a lucky hour"".  France was ruled by Charles VI who experienced a series of mental breakdowns, causing a crisis of leadership for the French monarchy. He was often absent from court and could eventually only make decisions with the approval of a royal council. Queen Isabeau was nominally in charge of governance when her husband was absent from court, but could not extinguish the quarrel between members of the royal family. In the past, Blanche of Castile had played a central role in the stability of the royal court and had acted as regent of France. Christine published a series of works on the virtues of women, referencing Queen Blanche and dedicating them to Queen Isabeau.Christine believed that France had been founded by the descendants of the Trojans and that its governance by the royal family adhered to the Aristotelian ideal. In 1400 Christine published L'Épistre de Othéa a Hector (Letter of Othea to Hector). When first published, the book was dedicated to Louis of Orléans, the brother of Charles VI, who was at court seen as potential regent of France. In L'Épistre de Othéa a Hector Hector of Troy is tutored in statecraft and the political virtues by the goddess of wisdom Othéa. Christine produced richly illustrated luxury editions of L'Épistre de Othéa a Hector in 1400. Between 1408 and 1415 Christine produced further editions of the book. Throughout her career she produced rededicated editions of the book with customised prologues for patrons, including an edition for Philip the Bold in 1403, and editions for Jean of Berry and Henry IV of England in 1404. Patronage changed in the late Middle Ages. Texts were still produced and circulated as continuous roll manuscripts, but were increasingly replaced by the bound codex. Members of royal family became patrons of writers by commissioning books. As materials became cheaper a book trade developed, so writers and bookmakers produced books for the French nobility, who could afford to establish their own libraries. Christine thus had no single patron who consistently supported her financially and became associated with the royal court and the different fractions of the royal family – the Burgundy, Orleans and Berry – each having their own respective courts. Throughout her career Christine undertook concurrent paid projects for individual patrons and subsequently published these works for dissemination among the nobility of France.In 1402 Christine became involved in a renowned literary controversy, the ""Querelle du Roman de la Rose"". Christine instigated this debate by questioning the literary merits of Jean de Meun's popular Romance of the Rose. Romance of the Rose satirizes the conventions of courtly love while critically depicting women as nothing more than seducers. In the midst of the Hundred Years' War between French and English kings, Christine published the dream allegory Le Chemin de long estude in 1403. In the first person narrative she and Cumaean Sibyl travel together and witness a debate on the state of the world between the four allegories – Wealth, Nobility, Chivalry and Wisdom. Christine suggests that justice could be brought to earth by a single monarch who had the necessary qualities.In 1404 Christine chronicled the life of Charles V, portraying him as the ideal king and political leader, in Le Livre des fais et bonnes meurs du sage roy Charles V. The chronicle had been commissioned by Philip the Bold and in the chronicle Christine passed judgement on the state of the royal court. When praising the efforts of Charles V in studying Latin, Christine lamented that her contemporaries had to resort to strangers to read the law to them. Before the book was completed, Philip the Bold died, and Christine offered the book to Jean of Berry in 1405, finding a new royal patron. She was paid 100 livre for the book by Philip's successor John the Fearless in 1406 and would receive payments from his court for books until 1412.In 1405 Christine published Le Livre de la cité des dames (The Book of the City of Ladies) and Le Livre des trois vertus (Book of Three Virtues, known as The Treasure of the City of Ladies). In Le Livre de la cité des dames Christine presented intellectual and royal female leaders, such as Queen Zenobia. Christine dedicated Le Livre des trois vertus to the dauphine Margaret of Nevers, advising the young princess on what she had to learn. As Queen Isabeau's oldest son Louis of Guyenne came of age Christine addressed three works to him with the intention of promoting wise and effective government. The earliest of the three works has been lost. In Livre du Corps de policie (The Book of the Body Politic), published in 1407 and dedicated to the dauphin, Christine set out a political treatise which analysed and described the customs and governments of late medieval European societies. Christine favoured hereditary monarchies, arguing in reference to Italian city-states that were governed by princes or trades, that ""such governance is not profitable at all for the common good"". Christine also devoted several chapters to the duties of a king as military leader and she described in detail the role of the military class in society.    France was at the verge of all out civil war since 1405. In 1407 John I of Burgundy, also known as John the Fearless, plunged France into a crisis when he had Louis of Orléans assassinated. The Duke of Burgundy fled Paris when his complicity in the assassination became known, but was appointed regent of France on behalf of Charles VI in late 1408 after his military victory in the Battle of Othee. It is not certain who commissioned Christine to write a treatise on military warfare, but in 1410 Christine published the manual on chivalry, entitled Livre des fais d'armes et de chevalerie (The Book of Feats of Arms and of Chivalry). Christine received 200 livre from the royal treasury in early 1411 for the book. In the preface Christine explained that she published the manual in French so that it could be read by practitioners of war not well versed in Latin. The book opened with a discussion of the just war theory advanced by Honoré Bonet. Christine also referenced classical writers on military warfare, such as Vegetius, Frontinus and Valerius Maximus. Christine discussed contemporary matters relating to what she termed the Laws of War, such as capital punishment, the payment of troops, as well as the treatment of noncombatants and prisoners of war. Christine opposed trial by combat, but articulated the medieval belief that God is the lord and governor of battle and that wars are the proper execution of justice. Nevertheless, she acknowledged that in a war ""many great wrongs, extortions, and grievous deeds are committed, as well as raping, killings, forced executions, and arsons"". Christine limited the right to wage war to sovereign kings because as head of states they were responsible for the welfare of their subjects. In 1411 the royal court published an edict prohibiting nobles from raising an army.After civil war had broken out in France, Christine in 1413 offered guidance to the young dauphin on how to govern well, publishing Livre de la paix (The Book of Peace). Livre de la paix would be Christine's last major work and contained detailed formulations of her thoughts on good governance.  The period was marked by bouts of civil war and failed attempts to bring John the Fearless to justice for assassinating his cousin. Christine addressed Louis of Guyenne directly, encouraging him to continue the quest for peace in France. She argued that ""Every kingdom divided in itself will be made desolate, and every city and house divided against itself will not stand"". Christine was acquainted with William of Tignonville, an ambassador to the royal court, and referenced Tignonville's speeches on the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War. Christine's drew a utopian vision of a just ruler, who could take advice from those older or wiser. In arguing that peace and justice were possible on earth as well as in heaven, Christine was influenced by Dante, who she had referenced in Le Chemin de long estude. Christine encouraged the dauphin to deserve respect, by administering justice promptly and living by worthy example. Christine urged young princes to make themselves available to their subjects, avoid anger and cruelty, to act liberally, clement and truthful. Christine's interpretation of the virtuous Christian prince built on the advice to rulers by St Benedict, Peter Abelard and Cicero.  In 1414 Christine presented Queen Isabeau with a lavishly decorated collection of her works (now known as British Library Harley 4431). The bound book contained 30 of Christine's writings and 130 miniatures. She had been asked by the queen to produce the book. Noted for its quality miniature illuminations, Christine herself and her past royal patrons were depicted. As a mark of ownership and authorship the opening frontispiece depicted Queen Isabeau being presented with the book by Christine.In 1418 Christine published a consolation for women who had lost family members in the Battle of Agincourt under the title Epistre de la prison de vie Humaine (Letter Concerning the Prison of Human Life). In it Christine did not express any optimism or hope that peace could be found on earth. Instead she expressed the view that the soul was trapped in the body and imprisoned in hell. The previous year she had presented the Epistre de la prison de vie Humaine to Marie of Berry, the administrator of the Duchy of Bourbon whose husband was held in English captivity.Historians assume that Christine spent the last ten years of her life in the Dominican Convent of Poissy because of the civil war and the occupation of Paris by the English. Away from the royal court her literary activity ceased. However, in 1429, after Joan of Arc's military victory over the English, Christine published the poem Ditié de Jehanne d'Arc (The Tale of Joan of Arc). Published just a few days after the coronation of Charles VII, Christine expressed renewed optimism. She cast Joan as the fulfilment of prophecies by Merlin, Cumaean Sibyl and Saint Bede, helping Charles VII to fulfill the predictions of Charlemagne.Christine is believed to have died in 1430, before Joan was tried and executed by the English. After her death the political crisis in France was resolved when Queen Isabeau's only surviving son Charles VII and John the Fearless' successor as Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, signed the Peace of Arras in 1435.

"Franciscus Patricius (Croatian: Franjo Petriš or Frane Petrić, Italian: Francesco Patrizi; 25 April 1529 – 6 February 1597) was an Italian philosopher and scientist of Croatian descent from the Republic of Venice. [SEP] He was known as a defender of Platonism and an opponent of Aristotelianism. In Croatia he is mostly referred to as Franjo Petriš or Frane Petrić (sometimes Petris, Petrišević and Petričević). His family name in Cres was known as Petris. Patricius studied at the University of Padua Aristotelian Philosophy, but turned to Platonism while still a student. He became a sharp, high-profile opponent of Aristotelianism, with whom he grappled extensively in extensive writings. After many years of unsuccessful efforts to secure material livelihood, he finally received an invitation in 1577 to the Ducal Court of Este in Ferrara. At the university there a chair for Platonic philosophy was set up especially for him. In the years that followed, he gained a reputation as a professor, but was also involved in scientific and literary controversy; he tended to polemic and was in turn violently attacked by opponents. In 1592 he accepted an invitation to Rome, where thanks to papal favor a new chair was created for him. A serious conflict darkened the last years of his life with the ecclesiastical Censorship, which banned his main work, the Nova de universis philosophia. As one of the last Renaissance humanists, Patricius was characterized by extensive education, varied scientific activity, a strong will to innovate and exceptional literary fertility. He critically examined established, universally recognized teachings and suggested alternatives. In particular, he wanted to replace the prevailing Aristotelian natural philosophy with his own model. He opposed the traditional view of the meaning of historical studies, which was usually restricted to moral instruction, with his concept of a broad, neutral, scientific historical research. In Poetry he emphasized the importance of Inspiration and fought against conventional rules, which he considered to be arbitrary, unrealistic restrictions on creative freedom. In the Early Modern Period, Patricius's strongly controversial philosophy of nature found considerable echo despite the church's condemnation, but remained an outsider position. Modern research recognizes his contributions to the constitution of modern concept of space and to historical theory.    Francesco Patricius came from the town Cres on the homonymous island in front of Istria (Italian  Cherso ). At that time the island belonged to Republic of Venice, but a large part of their population was Croatian. Francesco was an illegitimate son of the priest Stefano di Niccolò di Antonio Patricius (Stjepan Nikola Antun Petriš or Petrić), who belonged to the lower nobility. His mother was Stefano's partner Maria Radocca. In older literature, Francesco's father was mistakenly identified with the judge of the same name, Stefano di Niccolò di Matteo Patricius, and his mother Maria was identified with Maria Lupetino, the judge's alleged wife. Also incorrect is the claim related to the erroneous genealogy of a relationship of the philosopher with the famous theologian Matthias Flacius.According to Francesco, his family was originally based in Bosnia and, according to their coat of arms, was of royal descent. As a result of the Turkish conquest of her homeland, she emigrated, and so an ancestor named Stefanello came to Cres. This happened, if the communication is correct, in the second half of the 15th century.Following a humanistic custom, the philosopher Latinized his name and called himself  Patricius  or  Patritius . Since he lived in Italy and published his works there, the name form  Francesco Patricius  has established itself internationally, but in Croatia variants of the Croatian form are preferred. The addition ""da Cherso"" (from Cres) serves to distinguish it from the Siena humanist Francesco Patricius (Franciscus Patricius Senensis), who lived in the 15th century.       Francesco Patricius was born on 25 April 1529 in Cres. He initially spent his childhood in his hometown. His uncle Giovanni Giorgio Patricius (Ivan Juraj Petriš), who commanded a Venetian warship, took the only nine-year-old boy on a war campaign against the Turks in February 1538. So it turned out that Francesco participated in the Battle of Preveza, in which the Christian fleet was struck. He almost fell into Turkish captivity. He spent several years at sea. In September 1543 he went to Venice to acquire a professional qualification. Initially he went to a commercial school according to Giovanni Giorgio's will, but his inclination was for humanism. Since his father showed understanding for this, the youngster received Latin lessons. Later the father sent him to study at Ingolstadt, where the seat of the Bavarian University was. There he acquired knowledge of Greek. In 1546, however, he had to leave Bavaria because of the turmoil of the Schmalkaldic War.In May 1547 Patricius went to Padua, whose university was one of the most respected universities in Europe. Initially, at the request of his practical-thinking father Stefano, he studied medicine with Giambattista Montano, Bassiano Lando and Alberto Gabriele, but only very reluctantly. When Stefano died in 1551, he was able to drop out of medical training. He sold the medical books. He continued to be interested in humanistic education. During his studies, he attended philosophical lectures by professors Bernardino Tomitano, Marcantonio de 'Passeri (Marcantonio Genova), Lazzaro Buonamici and Francesco Robortello. Among his friends and fellow students was Niccolò Sfondrati, who later became pope as Gregory XIV. Philosophy classes were a disappointment for Patricius, because Padua was a stronghold of Aristotelian, whose representatives continued the tradition of medieval Scholastic. This was a direction that Patricius firmly rejected and fought violently later. Under the influence of a Franciscan scholar, he turned to Platonism. The Franciscan recommended the Neoplatonic teaching of the humanist Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499). The reading of Ficino's writings, especially his major philosophical-theological work, the  Theologia Platonica , was pioneering for Patricius. He later expressed his distance to Padua's scholastic-Aristotelian teaching practice by writing in an autobiographical letter in 1587 as self-taught represented. In his student days he already wrote and published philosophical and philological writings; he had a collection of his youth works printed in Venice in 1553.    In 1554, Patricius had to go with him because of a lengthy dispute over thein Uncle Giovanni Giorgio return to Cres. There he experienced an unpleasant time, which was characterized by illness, isolation and the family conflict. At that time he apparently belonged to the spiritual class - at least until 1560. He tried unsuccessfully to secure his livelihood in the long term To get home to an ecclesiastical. After this failure, he went to Rome in 1556, but his efforts for a benefice also failed there. Then he moved to Venice. The young scholar unsuccessfully sought employment at the glamorous courtyard of the house Este in Ferrara. After all, he gained a foothold in the Venetian humanist circles: he joined the Accademia della Fama, a scholarly community in which he found like-minded people.    The philosopher entered the service of the nobleman Giorgio Contarini in 1560, who belonged to one of the most distinguished genders of Venice. First, he had to teach Aristotelian ethics to his employer. Patricius soon won Contarini's trust and was given an important assignment: he was sent to Cyprus to inspect and then report on the family property, which was administered by a brother of Contarini. When he described the situation on his return in the summer of 1562, Contarini sent him again to Cyprus and gave him authorization to carry out measures for improvement. As the new administrator, Patricius ensured by Melioration a significant increase in the value of the land, which could now be used for growing cotton. However, the measures required were costly and poor harvests also reduced income, so that the client could not be satisfied. Contarini's Cypriot relatives, who Patricius discredited with his report, took this opportunity to take revenge and to blame the administrator on the head of the family. When Patricius's justification was not accepted, he asked to be released in 1567.Subsequently, Patricius initially stayed in Cyprus. He now entered the service of the Catholic Archbishop of Nicosia, the Venetian Filippo Mocenigo, who entrusted him with the administration of the villages belonging to the Archdiocese. But already in 1568 he left the island threatened by the Turks together with the archbishop and went to Venice. In retrospect, he saw the years in Cyprus as lost time. After all, he used the stay in the Greek-speaking world for an important humanistic concern: he searched for Greek manuscripts with considerable success, which he then bought or had written down, or perhaps even copied himself.    Upon his return, Patricius returned to science. He now went to Padua again, where he apparently no longer worked at the university but only gave private lessons. Among his disciples was Zaccaria Mocenigo, a nephew of the archbishop. It was very important to him to exchange ideas with the well-known philosopher Bernardino Telesio, with whom he later remained in correspondence.During this time, Patricius's relationship with the archbishop deteriorated. He made contact with Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y de la Cerda, the viceroy of Catalonia, who was an enthusiastic book collector. The beginning of this connection was promising: the viceroy invited him to Barcelona and offered him the prospect of employment as a court philosopher with an annual salary of five hundred ducat. As a result, Patricius made his first trip to Spain. In Barcelona, however, he was very disappointed because the financial promise was not kept. For these circumstances, the philosopher was forced to return in 1569.  One of the benefits of the trip, however, was the prospect of making a living in the long-distance book trade. The export of books from Italy to Barcelona seemed lucrative; Patricius had been able to reach an agreement with business partners there before he left. Shipping started and actually proved worthwhile at first, but the company eventually failed because of the philosopher's inexperience and lack of business talent. A serious blow hit Patricius in 1570 when the Turks in Cyprus captured a shipment of goods belonging to him and intended for export to Venice, for which he had spent 3,500 ducats. As a result, he got into such trouble that he turned to his former employer, Contarini, who he still owed him 200 ducats. When the latter refused to pay, a lengthy process appeared which Patricius apparently lost.In order to restructure his financial situation, Patricius turned to book production. In August 1571 he entered into a contract with the heir to the manuscript of a script by the late scholar Girolamo Ruscelli about Emblems,  Le imprese illustri . He took over the editing, and the work was published the following year by a Venetian printer. However, Patricius was unable to meet his contractual obligations due to his precarious financial situation. This resulted in a conflict, which was difficult to resolve. After this unpleasant experience, Patricius founded his own publishing house,  all'Elefanta . There he published three books in 1573, but then the publisher went in. The philosopher then went on a new trip to Spain in 1574 to sue his former business partners and sell Greek manuscripts. In February 1575 he was received by Antonio Gracián, the secretary king Philip II, Who gave him for the royal library in the El Escorial 75 Codices. From a humanistic point of view, however, this commercial success was questionable, because the escorial was considered a ""book grave"" by the scholars. When the legal proceedings for the failed book trade dragged on without any foreseeable result, Patricius returned home after thirteen months.Upon his return, Patricius settled in Modena in 1577, where he entered the service of the respected musician and poet Tarquinia Molza, to whom he gave Greek lessons.    In Modena, Patricius received the invitation to the ducal court of Ferrara that had been sought two decades ago. At the turn of the year 1577/1578 he arrived in Ferrara. He was warmly received by Herzog Alfonso II. D'Este, an important cultural patron. His advocate there was the Ducal Council - from 1579 secretary - Antonio Montecatini, who valued him very much, although he was a representative of the Aristotelianism that Patricius had fought against from a Platonic perspective. At Montecatini's suggestion, a chair for Platonic philosophy was set up for Patricius at the University of Ferrara. The starting salary of 390 lire was later increased to 500. The time of material worries was over.With the move to Ferrara, the new professor began an enjoyable and profitable phase of life. He was highly regarded both at the glamorous court of Alfonso and in the academic environment. He was friends with the Duke. Patricius also had a good personal relationship with the famous poet Torquato Tasso, who lived in Ferrara, even though he had a controversy with him in a controversial event. In the fourteen years of his work in Ferrara, he published numerous writings.However, Patricius's dedicated opinions on philosophical and literary issues also caused controversy and led to disputes. Because of Aristotle's criticism, a written polemic with the Aristotelian Teodoro Angelucci eased. In the literary field, Patricius was involved in a dispute over the criteria of poetic quality, in which Camillo Pellegrino and Torquato Tasso took the opposite view.     Patricius's academic career finally peaked thanks to the benevolence of Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini, who invited him to Rome in October 1591. In January 1592 Aldobrandini was elected Pope and took the name Clement VIII. He gave an enthusiastic welcome to the scholar who arrived in Rome on 18 April 1592. At the Sapienza University of Rome a chair for Platonic philosophy was created for Patricius. The professor had his residence in the house of Cinzio Passeri Aldobrandini, who was a nephew of the Pope and a well-known patron and was raised to Cardinal in 1593. On 15 May, he gave his inaugural lecture on Plato's ""Timaios"" ""to a large audience. The allowance granted to him - 500 ducats basic salary, with allowances a good 840 ducats"" - was the highest on the Sapienza. It was a sign of the special papal favor that the Platonist received. Among his listeners and interlocutors was Torquato Tasso, now living in Rome, who did not regret the conflict in Ferrara.Despite his excellent relationship with the Pope, Patricius soon became a target of church censorship. The occasion was his major philosophical work  Nova de universis philosophia , which he published in Ferrara in 1591. There the censor Pedro Juan Saragoza discovered a number of statements which he considered heretical or at least suspicious and which he denounced in an expert report. Among other things, he declared the statement that the earth was rotating to be erroneous because this was incompatible with the Scriptures. According to the consensus of the theologians, it can be gathered from the Bible that the fixed star sky revolves around the immovable earth.In October 1592 the index congregation, the fauthority responsible for the Index of Forbidden Books. In November 1592, she summoned the author of the suspect document and allowed him to read Saragoza's report, which was unusual for the accused at the time. Patricius responded to the censor's attack with a letter of defense, the  Apologia ad censuram , in which he basically declared his submission, but defended his position aggressively and assumed Saragoza incompetence. He found no understanding. He later tried unsuccessfully to satisfy the panel with written explanations of his teaching and concessions. Even after the Congregation decided in December 1592 to list the  Nova de universis philosophia  in the new version of the index, the author continued his rescue efforts, while the publication of the new index of 1593 was delayed. The main disadvantage was that the censor responsible last, the Jesuit Francisco de Toledo, was a well-known representative of the patriotic scholastic Aristotelianism. In July 1594 the congregation banned the distribution and reading of the work and ordered the destruction of all traceable copies. Scripture was listed in the updated edition of the index, which appeared in 1596, and in subsequent editions. However, the author was expressly encouraged to submit an amended version for approval. The aged and conflict-ridden philosopher tackled the revision, but was unable to finish it because he died on 7 February 1597 with a fever. He was buried in the Roman church Sant'Onofrio al Gianicolo next to Torquato Tasso.   "

"Gian Rinaldo Carli (1720–1795), also known by other names, was an Italian economist, historian, and antiquarian. [SEP]    ""Gian Rinaldo Carli"" is the modern Italian form of his name, which may also appear as ""Gianrinaldo Carli"" or ""Gian-Rinaldo Carli"". His Delle Monete was credited to ""Conte Don Gianrinaldo Carli-Rubbi"". In this name, conte is the Italian form of ""count"", don is an honorific derived from the Latin dominus (""lord, master""), ""Gian"" is the most common Italian diminutive for Giovanni, and his surname has been hyphenated with his wife's. His Degli Anfiteatri was credited to ""Commendatore Conte Don Gianrinaldo Carli"", where commendatore is the Italian form of ""commander"", from his knightly honors. He signed his name in Latin as ""Johannes Rinaldus Comes Carlius"". In early English sources, his name also appears as ""Giovanni Rinaldo, Count of Carli"", and ""Giovanni Rinaldo, Count of Carli-Rubbi"".     Giovanni Rinaldo Carli was born at Capo d'Istria in the Republic of Venice (now Koper in Slovenia) on April 11, 1720, the eldest child of Count Rinaldo Carli and Cecilia Imberti.He distinguished himself as a student and young scholar. In 1744, at the age of 24, he was appointed by the Venetian Senate to the University of Padua's newly established professorship of astronomy and navigation. At the same time, he was entrusted with superintendence over the Venetian marine. During these years he was part of a major dispute in Italian academia over the existence of sorcerers, with the vast majority of the academics siding with the Girolamo Tartarotti against the Marquis of Maffei and Count Carli's sharp scepticism. He filled his offices ably for seven years before resigning them to study economics and history. He works on economics attracted the attention of Leopold of Tuscany, afterwards emperor, who placed him at the head of his economics council and board of public instruction in 1765. In 1769, he became privy councillor and, in 1771, president of a new council of finances. In his old age, he was relieved of the duties of these offices while continuing to receive their income. During his leisure, he produced works on Italian history and other topics.Count Carli died of illness at Cusano in Milan on February 22, 1795.   "

"The Podestà of Constantinople was the official in charge of Venetian possessions in the Latin Empire and the Venetian quarter of Constantinople during the 13th century. [SEP] Nominally a vassal to the Latin Emperor, the Podestà functioned as a ruler in his own right, and answered to the Doge of Venice. The podestà was also officially known as Governor of One-Fourth and One-Half of the Empire of Romania and was entitled to wearing the crimson buskins as the emperors.       The Venetians had enjoyed their own quarter in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople since the 1082 chrysobull of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. How that colony colony was governed is unknown; most likely it elected its own local elders, but occasionally consuls sent from Venice, or passing captains of the Venetian fleet, may have assumed some political responsibility.The Venetian position in Constantinople was immensely strengthened as a result of the Fourth Crusade, in which the Venetian fleet, and the Doge Enrico Dandolo, played a critical role. In the aftermath of the Sack of Constantinople and the establishment of the Latin Empire, he secured for Venice terms that made it paramount in the new state: the Republic claimed three eighths of the former Byzantine possessions, ensured recognition of the privileges the Republic had enjoyed under the Byzantine emperors, secured a dominant voice in the election of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, and pushed through its own candidate, Baldwin of Flanders, as the first Latin Emperor. Dandolo himself remained in Constantinople and received the exalted Byzantine title of Despot. Until his death on 29 May 1205, in the aftermath of the disastrous Battle of Adrianople, he remained the ruler of the local Venetians, and one of the most important statesmen of the Latin Empire.     After Dandolo's death, the Venetians of Constantinople elected Marino Zeno as ""By the Grace of God Podestà and lord of one quarter and one half [quarter] of the whole Empire of Romania"" in the Doge's stead. The use of such lofty titles was also a stake for influence given the existing power vacuum in the Latin Empire following Adrianople.Already in the first act of the new official, dated 29 June 1205, he appears with his own privy council, with a composition similar to the council of the Doge in Venice: judges (judices communi), councillors (consciliatores), a treasurer (camerarius), and a prosecutorial magistrate (avocatorio). According to the 16th-century historian Daniele Barbaro, for a while after Dandolo's death it was seriously considered to move the capital of the Republic from Venice to Constantinople. Although in all probability a later invention, it is an indication of the size and eminence of the Venetiam community in Constantinople become at this time, as well as the dominant role the Venetian played in the affairs of the Latin Empire.When Pietro Ziani was elected Doge in Venice to succeed Dandolo, on the one hand he (reluctantly) recognized the fait accompli of Zeno's election and confirmed him in his office, but also moved quickly ""to redress the balance"" between the mother city and its colony in Constantinople. In the first of these actions, October 1205, Zeno ceded Durazzo, Vagenetia, and Corfu, territories belonging to the Venetian share of the Empire of Romania and strategically located at the exit of the Adriatic, directly to Venice, although in reality the area was held by the Greek ruler of Epirus, Michael I Komnenos Doukas, whom the Venetians recognized in these possessions in 1210 as a Venetian vassal. At about the same time, Ziani issued a decree allowing any Venetian or allied citizen to privately occupy and govern any formerly Byzantine territory, with the right to pass this possession on to his descendants. This decree effectively bypassed the Podestà as the nominal head of the Venetians in the Latin Empire: men like the Venetian Marco Sanudo, who founded the Duchy of Naxos, were thus subordinated directly to the Latin Emperor.After 1207, the title ""Lord of one fourth and one half of the Empire of Romania"" (dominator quartae partis et dimidiae Imperii Romaniae) was applied to the Doge rather than the Podestà, who became simply ""the Podestà of the Venetians in Constantinople"" (in Constantinopoli Venetorum Potestas). The Doges retained that title until the 1358 Treaty of Zara, and although some of the Podestàs used it, it was only in their capacity as the Doge's representative.    Based on an agreement concluded in October 1205, the Podestà and his councillors (consiliarii) formed part of the executive council (consilium) of the Latin Empire, which was responsible for defence and foreign policy matters, as well as adjudicating disputes between the Emperor and his feudal lieges, alongside the Emperor and the ""Frankish magnates"" (magnates Francigenarum). However, the Venetian position was ambiguous: as Filip Van Tricht explains, Venice was ""at one and the same time an independent state and a feudal partner in the empire"". Thus the Podestà conducted his own negotiations and concluded trade agreements with neighbouring rulers, although this independence did not extend to other areas of foreign policy, and the commercial agreements appear to have been largely aligned with the Latin Empire's policy at the time.The tension between Venice and the Emperor is evident in the frequent attempts by the emperors and powerful barons of the Latin Empire to intrude in nominally Venetian jurisdictions, and restrict and even revert Venetian claims and rights deriving from the Empire's foundational treaties of 1204–1205. This tendency arose very quickly: already by 1208, the executive council stipulated in 1205 had ceased to play its intended role, and the Emperor ceased involving the Podestà or the Venetians in his decisions. This development was aided on the one hand by the stabilization of the Empire's military situation after its catastrophic early years, and by the relative weakness of the Podestà and his councillors, given their brief and circumscribed tenures, vis-a-vis the Emperor and his barons.    In 1261, when Constantinople was retaken by the Byzantines under Michael VIII Palaiologos, the office of Podestà ceased to exist and the Venetians were expelled from the city. In the Treaty of 1265/68 with Palaiologos, under which the Venetians were allowed to return, and the subsequent treaties, the Venetian colony in the city was now headed by an official known as the Bailo (baiulus or rector).    Marino Zeno, 1205–1207 Ottaviano Quirino, c. 1209 Marino Dandolo, unknown date, but probably between Quirino and Tiepolo Jacopo Tiepolo, in 1219–1220/21; during his tenure he concluded a treaty with the Empire of Nicaea, and received the title of Despot.

"The Bailo of Corfu  was the leader of the Venetian delegation to the island of Corfu who oversaw the affairs of the island while under Venetian rule and protected the commercial and military interests of the Republic of Venice. [SEP] The first mention of a bailo in Corfu is in 1386 and is found in a Greek chronicle. The bailo of Corfu is also mentioned in a document by historian Marco Guazzo from 1544.Amongst the Venetian provincial administrators, the Duke of Candia was the foremost, followed in order of seniority by the leaders of Negroponte, Corfu, Modon and Coron and Argos-Nauplion. The bailo of Corfu also administered the affairs of the Venetian dependencies of Butrinto and Lepanto in the mainland. Pantaleone Barbo was the first bailo of Corfu. The bailo of Corfu also made reports and recommendations to Venice regarding the construction of fortifications on the island.    To protect its military and commercial interests the Republic of Venice had established missions in key locations in the Ionian Sea and the Aegean. The Venetian missions were called reggimenti and their leaders were elected by the Senate of Venice or its Great Council. The leaders were elected for terms ranging between approximately 16 months to three years.The general title of the leaders was Rettore, translated as rector. However the specific title awarded the rector varied depending on the location they administered. Thus in the Kingdom of Candia the leader was called Duca, in Zante the term was Conte and in Corfu the leader of the regiment was given the title of Bailo.Being elected Rettore was an honour and established that the elected leader had the confidence of his peers in the Senate and Great Council and, although a mission in the overseas protectorates of Venice was expensive and dangerous, many Venetian noblemen lobbied for the position. Cuprus, Candia and possibly Corfu were considered the top locations of the Venetian realm. The position of Bailo of Corfu was considered prestigious. In one occasion when Gian Matteo, after retiring as Rettore of Cattaro, lost the election to the position in Corfu, he was consoled by Pietro, a Venetian nobleman: ""God be praised that those who have taken away Corfu could not take away your virtue and valour. Perhaps this is for the best, so that you would not have to continually fight and defend yourself from Barbarossa.""    During the Ottoman invasion of Albania, the bailo of Corfu sent intelligence to the Venetian Senate advising them of the Ottoman gains after they took Rugina, known at the time as the ""Lady of Valona"", and Valona proper. The Venetians were very concerned about the Ottoman incursions which threatened the dominion and commerce of Venice and its dependencies in the Adriatic and the Strait of Otranto. The bailo of Corfu also sent messages to Venice regarding his ideas about fortifications. In 1538 in one such message the bailo of Corfu remarked: ""[P]lease pay no attention to the last scheme forwarded to you by the military governor here, it is 'criticised by everyone' and I have had to dismiss the engineer Zanin 'who, though he seems stupid when he speaks, being from the Bergamasco, is in mind and deed full of excellent ideas and of sense and experience – but he does have the defect of being unable to communicate his ideas to anyone else ... Could we not have Michel [Michele Sanmicheli] ... who was so much praised by the late Duke of Urbino?'""    This list is derived from Karl Hopf, Chroniques gréco-romanes inédites ou peu connues (Berlin: Weidmann, 1873), pp. 392–96. In 1386, Venice was represented at Corfu by three provveditori: Michele Contarini, Saracino Dandolo and Marino Malipiero. There followed a series of baili that lasted down to the end of the republic:   "

[SEP] He was the original publisher of Luca Pacioli's mathematical works, Summa de arithmetica and De divina proportione, and of what is thought to be the first printed version of the Quran in Arabic.    Born in Brescia in the mid-fifteenth century, Paganini moved to Venice at a young age. In Venice he entered the field of publishing in 1483, working with publishers Bernardino Benali and Giorgio Arrivabene. In 1487 he printed and published his first independent work, a copy of the Roman Missal (published for the first time in 1474). In the following years he devoted himself to the printing of various works on theology and jurisprudence, including an exceptional Bible with accompanying illustrations and commentary by Nicholas of Lyra. His publications also included significant works on mathematics and politics. In 1517 he returned with his son Alessandro and his wife to Brescia, where he founded his own print shop in the monastery on Isola del Garda; he later settled in the town of Toscolano, which today is part of the municipality of Toscolano-Maderno.

He studied at the University of Padua and, having embraced a priestly life, moved to Venice where he became a secretary of nuncio Giovanni Battista Agucchi. Bolizza wrote Agucchi's funeral oration with a dedication to his mentor Claude de Mesmes, comte d'Avaux, the French ambassador to the Republic of Venice. A member of the Bolizza family, his ancestor and family progenitor was Zuane Bolizza, mentioned in 1538.

"Alberto Fortis (1741–1803) was a Venetian writer, naturalist and cartographer. [SEP]    Born Giovanni Battista Fortis (his religious name was Alberto) in Padua on either 9 or 11 of November 1741. He journeyed extensively in Venetian Dalmatia. His best known work is Viaggio in Dalmazia (Travels into Dalmatia), originally published in 1774 and first published in London in 1778.The highlight of the book is the description of ""Morlachia"", a term used by Fortis for the rural Dalmatian interior to distinguish it from the coastal towns under the influence of Venice. In his book, Fortis presented his literary discovery ""Hasanaginica"" as a Morlach (Vlach) ballad. Larry Wolf believed Fortis wrote the ballad as a poetry of South Slavs rather than a poetry of the Morlachs. Fortis believed that the Morlachs preserved their old customs and clothes. Their ethnographic traits were traditional clothings, use of the gusle musical instrument accompanied with epic singing. He also published several specimens of Morlach songs. Morlachs were speaking a language close to Romanian but they were Slavicized and finally many of them Islamized, under Turkish occupation. Fortis noted that Morlachs called themselves ""Vlachs"". Alberto Fortis's account of the Morlachs, translated into French, English and German brought the Morlachs to the attention of Europe.The Croatian writer Ivan Lovrić, who wrote Notes on 'Travels in Dalmatia' of Abbe Alberto Fortis, accused Fortis of many factual errors, which he attempted to rectify. Travels into Dalmatia played an important role in bringing the Dalmatian culture to the attention of Europe during the rise of Romantic notions about folklore. Dalmatian hinterlands became epitomized by Hasanaginica, a folk ballad that was first written down by Fortis.In 1795 Fortis was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in London. He died in Bologna eight years later on 21 October 1803.   "

"Simeon Končarević (Serbian Cyrillic:  ; about 1690 – 26 August 1769) was a Serbian Orthodox bishop in Venetian Dalmatia, serving from 1751 to 1757, before emigrating from Dalmatia to Imperial Russia with Jovan Horvat, the leader of the migrating Serbs. [SEP] Končarević is the author of the ""Chronicle of the Dalmatian (Orthodox) Bishop Simeon Končarević"" which is unfortunately lost but which is preserved in the works by Nikodim Milaš.    Simeon was born in Karin to a Serbian Orthodox couple, V. Rev. Jovan and Pavlina Končarević. Simeon was educated in Zadar, Venice, and Kyiv Mohyla Academy (now National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy) where he became fluent in Latin, Italian and Russian. He was appointed the parish priest of Benkovac in 1720 by Stevan Ljubibratić, the Serbian Orthodox bishop of Dalmatia (1716–20) who was expelled the same year by the Venetian government on the grounds that he had been invested by a foreign cleric. In Venetian Dalmatia, the Serbian clergy were forced to recognize the local Catholic bishop as their superiors. Serbs had to allow the local Catholic diocesan bishop to visit and inspect, randomly, any Orthodox church and forced the erection of a Roman Catholic altar beside the already existing Orthodox altar (and iconostasis) so that the Catholic services could be conducted at will. Končarević stopped Andrea Balbi, an Italian Catholic bishop, from making such a canonical visitation to the Serbian church in Benkovac by standing at the entrance and brandishing a sabre, in 1728. Due to this, Končarević was imprisoned in a dungeon. After his release, he convoked an assembly of priests on 16 June 1731, the 22 participants deciding that the Serbian Orthodox priesthood did not recognize ""no Latin bishops"". The Orthodox clergy petitioned the state and wrote also to the Serbian Patriarch asking to appoint a bishop for Dalmatia. It took two more decades before a bishop was invested. In the meantime, the Dalmatian Serbs put up a valiant fight to preserve their national identity. Eventually, Končarević decided to become a monk in the Krupa monastery on Christmas day in 1751. He was consecrated by Bishop Gavrilo Mihić Mihailović (1741–1752) of the Metropolitanate of Dabar–Bosnia and two other bishops, with the permission of Patriarch Atanasije II Gavrilović of Peć.    Being a spokesman and patriot of the people, Bishop Simeon Končarević was expelled from Dalmatia two years later (1753). In a worrying development, the dissatisfied Serb population began to migrate to the neighbouring territory of the Habsburg Empire. Such political unrest and the danger from the Uniates movement caused the departure of hundreds of people from North Dalmatia, under the leadership of Bishop Končarević, to Russia as well. A long time passed until the Serbs in Dalmatia were allowed to have their own bishop. Only under Napoleonic French domination were the Orthodox Serbs allowed to organize their church life and to have their own bishop. Following that dispensation, Metropolitan Benedikt Kraljević (1810–1829), a refugee from Bosnia as well, was appointed Bishop of Dalmatia. Upon the departure of the French, Bishop Benedikt, under heavy pressure from the Austrian authorities and the Roman Catholic Church, gave in to the Union. The Orthodox Serbs refused to accept the Uniate Church, and Bishop Benedikt was forced to abandon the Episcopal Throne.    The Serbs always demanded an Orthodox bishop, instead of a Catholic one, asking for help in this matter from the Metropolitan of Karlovci, Stefan Stratimirović, and pleading to Russia as well. It was all in vain. After the death of Simeon Končarević in 1769, Serbian bishops were not appointed any more because of the constant opposition of the archbishop of Zadar, Mateo Karaman, and of the Dalmatian clergy, which lasted until the fall of the Venetian Republic.

He was born on the island of Crete, as a member of an Italian colonial family, which then was part of the Republic of Venice, known as the Kingdom of Candia, in the city of Heraklion (then called Candia, hence his appellation). He left the island through one of his mother's relatives at the service of the Crown of Aragon, who took him to the Kingdoms of Italy. During his period in Italy he was training to become a Condottieri and trained in the arms; he fought against the Turks and in the Italian campaigns including the Battle of Pavia, before transferring to the Iberian peninsula to serve the Spanish Catholic Queen and King.

While residing at Cuzco, he made arms and ammunition for Pizarro, who was then fighting against Almagro. After the defeat of Almagro at Battle of Las Salinas, Candia undertook the conquest of Ambaya beyond the Andes, but was unsuccessful, being finally arrested by order of Hernando Pizarro. Disgusted at his treatment, and deserted by his old friends, he then joined the followers of Almagro and, with the aid of sixteen other Greeks, brought the guns that were taken by young Almagro to the battle of Chupas, where Candia supported the local natives by performing badly in the battle. Almagro suspected treason and ordered his troops to kill Candia after attacking him with his own hands.    Based on his special assignment to engage with local natives by the Spanish Crown edict, Candia took special attention to communicating with the Incas and other vassal natives, that helped him to record his greatest discovery of the Golden Temple of the Sun built by Huayna Capac.

It is the members of the Labia family of the mid 18th century to whom the palazzo owes its notability today, it was inhabited by two brothers with their wives, children and mother.   The brothers Angelo Maria Labia and his brother Paolo Antonio Labia employed Giovanni Battista Tiepolo at the height of his powers to decorate the ballroom which was decorated by The Banquet of Cleopatra. Employing Tiepolo seems to have been the most remarkable thing the brothers ever achieved. Angelo Maria became an Abbé, merely in order to escape the political obligations of an aristocrat of the Republic. Curiously his holy employment did not prevent him marrying. His wife however was a commoner, which indicates an almost morganatic status to the marriage. Angelo's chief interests were constructing a marionette theatre, which concealed real singers behind its scenes. The marionettes often performed satirical plays which Angelo wrote himself. In later life he failed to endear himself to Venetian society by becoming an informer to the dreaded inquisition. His younger brother Paolo, married conventionally into the old Venetian aristocracy, a class prepared to accept the Labia's money and hospitality if not equality. Paolo too never assumed any public duties. It appears that it was their mother, Maria Labia, who was the intellectual driving force of the family, in her youth a great beauty, she was painted by Rosalba Carriera. The French traveller and social commentator Charles de Brosses reported that in old age she had a lively wit, flirtatious nature and possessed the finest collection of jewels in Europe. This collection was also portrayed in some of Tiepolo's work in the palazzo."
"The Humoj or Omoj was an Albanian noble family that served as pronoiars of the Republic of Venice in the region of Baleč and Drivast (modern day Albania) in the 15th century. [SEP]     When Baleč came under control of the Republic of Venice it became a pronoia of Radič I Humoj who later controlled the fortress of Petra in the region of Polat. According to the Venetian reports, Radic Humoj was a prominent pronoier in the region of Scutari in July 1403. Donato de Porto, a governor of Scutari, appointed Radic as pronoier of Baleč in period 1402—1403 and Senate confirmed his decision on 16 September 1404.Radic Humoj, like many other local Venetian pronoiers, supported Balša III during his war with the Venetian Republic in order to save his position and property. Balša III had some initial success at the beginning of 1405 and captured the whole Scutari region except the Scutari fortress itself. The Venetians managed to recapture Scutari region in the second half of 1405 and to take control over former Radic's possessions. Although Radic Humoj again pledged loyalty to Venice, they refused to return to him his previous pronoias. Only after Radič had been killed while fighting for Venice and after the governor of Scutari informed the Senate about his merits, the Venetian Senate decided on 19 September 1410 to appoint Radic's sons on his earlier position.After Radic's death, the Venetians gave Baleč to his brother Andreas (who was then voivoda of the area north of the Shkoder) and his son Kojcin. This was confirmed by the Venetian Senate on 13 February 1419. During the Second Scutari War Andreas Humoj joined Serbian despot while other members of Humoj family remained loyal to Venetians.Kojčin Humoj was married to a daughter of Zuan Anglezi, a Venetian officer in Shkoder fortress, and they had two sons, Radičlc (Radic II Humoj) and Marin. Radic II Humoj married a daughter of Peter Spani in 1433 and became pronoier of the village Serel in Bar district. When Kojcin died, Venice gave his pronoia to somebody else and promised to the young Radic II Humoj in November 1441 to give him some pronoia as soon as the pronoier in charge would have died. Since 1441, Radic and Marin were pronoiers of Gleros near Shkoder, which once belonged to the Bonzi.When Radič Humoj rebelled against the Venetians, Peter Spani requested the Venetian Senate to give him control over Radic's fortress Petra.In 1443 Michael Humoj and his three brothers were pronoiars of the village with four houses, Passo Bianco in Drivast. When Passo Bianco became object of dispute among the Humoj  brothers, the Venetian Senate decided in 1445 that only Michael would have remained pronoiar of that village.    Andrea and Kojcin Humoj, together with Simeon Vulkata, led the pro-Venetian alliance against Skanderbeg, fighting particularly fiercely for the control over Baleč and Drivast in 1447. Members of many local families participated in war on the Venetian side. These were Vasilije Ugrin, Zapa family (Jovan and his brother), Pedantari family (seven Pedantari brothers and many other), Moneta family (three sons of Rajko Moneta), Malonši family (Petar with his two sons), Buša Sornja from Dagnum and many others. Koja Humoj was killed during a charge on Sati (castle).    Between 1456 and August 1457 a small war was waged between two branches of the Dukagjini family. Between Ottoman supported Lekë and Pal Dukagjini on one side and Draga Dukagjini, son of Nicholas Dukagjini, supported by Venice. In this war Humoj family, together with Skanderbeg and Moneta family served Venetian forces.Andrija Humoj travelled to Venice in 1464 to affirm his family's claims in front of the Venetian Senate emphasizing the deeds of his ancestors. He again visited Venice in 1472 and during the Siege of Shkodra in 1474 when all of Humoj ownership titles were confirmed once more. The members of Humoj family did not enjoy their confirmed positions for long because many of them, like many members of the Moneta family also, died fighting against the Ottoman Empire until the Ottoman capture of Shkoder in 1479. Among them were Koja, Tanush, Duka, Michael und Piero Humoj. In January 1478, before the siege has started, the wife of Koja Humoj and their daughter went to Venice together with wives and children of many other noblemen from Scutari, including the wife of Rajko Moneta and five children. When Andreas Humoj committed a treason he was sentenced to death by the Venetian commander-in-chief Triadan Gritti and executed by a man from Tuzi.After the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Constantinople which ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire, the members of Humoj family together with the rest of the citizens of Shkoder emigrated to Italy.    Marin Barleti mentions Blasius Humoj as a knight in Shkoder in his work The Siege of Shkodra (Latin: De obsidione Scodrensi, Venice, 1504). Girolamo de Rada mentions Cola Humoj as one of the knights fighting in the Siege of Shkoder along with Milosao, the prince of Shkoder.

"Lombardo, the name of a family of Venetian sculptors and architects; their surname was apparently Solaro, and the name of Lombardo was given to the earliest known, Martino, who emigrated from Lombardy to Venice in the middle of the 15th century AD and became celebrated as an architect. [SEP] Martino Lombardo had two sons, Moro and Pietro, of whom the latter (c. 1435-1515) was one of the greatest sculptors and architects of his time, while his sons Antonio (died 1516) and Tullio (died 1532) were hardly less celebrated. Tullio's son Sante Lombardo (1504–1560) is purely known as an architect.      Pietro's work as an architect is seen in numerous churches, the Ca' Vendramin Calergi (1481, with Mauro Codussi), the doge 's palace (1498), the facade (1485) of the scuola of St. Mark's, Venice and the cathedral of Cividale del Friuli (1502); but he is now more famous as a sculptor, often in collaboration with his sons; he executed the tomb of the doge Mocenigo (1478) in the church of San Giovanni e Paolo at Venice, and a bas-relief for the tomb of Dante at Ravenna, and in 1483 began the beautiful decorations in the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice, which is associated with his workshop.     Antonio's masterpiece is the marble relief of St. Anthony making a new-born child speak in defence of its mother's honour, in the Santo at Padua (1505).     Tullio's best-known works are the four kneeling angels (1484) in the Church of San Martino, Venice, a coronation of the Virgin Mary in San Giovanni Crisostomo and two bas-reliefs in the Santo, Padua, besides two others formerly in the Spitzer collection, representing Vulcan's Forge and Minerva disputing with Neptune.

"The Moneta family was a 15th-century noble family of Zeta, Serbian Despotate and Venetian Republic in the region of Scutari (modern day Albania). They first served Zeta's Lord Balša III and Serbian despot Stefan Lazarević before they became pronoiars of the Venetian Republic in 1423. [SEP] Their religion was Eastern Orthodox and they ruled the land between rivers Bojana and Drin. The most notable members of the Moneta family include Rajko Moneta, his wife Jelena and their three sons. First Rajko and then his sons participated in numerous military conflicts including the Second Scutari War, the Albanian–Venetian War (1447–1448) and the Ottoman sieges of Scutari, first in 1474 and then 1478/1479. After Scutari was captured by the Ottomans in 1479 Nicholas, one of the sons who became voivode of Scutari, went to Venice to join his wife and their five children who took refuge in Venice in 1478 before the last Ottoman siege of Scutari started.    Rajko Moneta was a nobleman in service of Balša III. He was married to Jelena, a daughter of Jelisanta, a granddaughter of Olivera Mrnjavčević and a great-granddaughter of King Vukašin Mrnjavčević. Rajko controlled four big villages and large areas of land. Balsha III took many Venetian prisoners when he captured Drivast at the end of August 1419 and exchanged them for his three noble men captured by Venice, one of them being Rajko Moneta. After death of Balsha III Rajko Moneta served despot Stefan Lazarević, but decided to leave him in 1423, during the Second Scutari War.    As Venetian pronoier Rajko Moneta controlled four salt ponds in Grbalj valley near Kotor. After the Second Scutari War Venice did not allow anybody to sell salt from Grbalj anywhere else except at Kotor market, not even to loyal Venetian vassal Nicholas Moneta.Olivera Mrnjavčević, a great-grandmother of Rajko's wife Jelena, built the Church of the Holy Virgin Mary in Lorenc (unknown place which did not belong to Scutari region) sometime before 1371. The property of the church was later increased with the gifts of Balša III. Based on the jus patronatus this church was inherited by the descendants of Olivera, Jelena and her sons Jacob and Nicholas. Nicholas and Jacob Moneta complained to Venetian Senate because the governor of Scutari gave two churches which belonged to Olivera's legacy to two abbots of his choice.In 1443 the Venetians gave tax benefits to Rajko Moneta to stimulate settling of the village of St. Vraza (Serbian:  ).Members of the Moneta family (three sons of Rajko Moneta) participated in the Albanian–Venetian War (1447–1448) as Venetian pronoiers struggling against Skanderbeg.Between 1456 and August 1457 a small war was waged between two branches of the Dukagjini family. Between Ottoman supported Lekë and Pal Dukagjini on one side and Draga Dukagjini, son of Nicholas Dukagjini, supported by Venice. In this war Moneta family, together with Skanderbeg and Humoj family served Venetian forces.Nicholas Moneta was a wealthy Venetian patrician and voivode of Scutari who fought against the Ottomans during the Siege of Krujë (1466–1467) (joined by Skanderbeg and some members of the Dukagjini family). Nicholas Moneta and two other Orthodox Christians were authorized by the Senate to be procurators of Serbian churches on Skadar lake. Jacob Moneta (Serbian:  ) borrowed supplies and money to Venetian governors. Once he borrowed some money to Zuan Contarini to pay the salary to the Venetian mercenaries in Krujë.    Jacob and Nicholas fought against the Ottomans during two sieges of Scutari, one in 1474 and another in 1478–1479. Marin Barleti in his work about the siege of Shkodra describes Jacob Moneta as Venetian officer who fought against the Ottomans. During the Siege of Shkodra (1478—1479) Nicholas was a commander of cavalry. In January 1478, before the siege has started, his wife and their five children went to Venice together with wives and children of many other noblemen from Scutari, including the wife of Koja Humoj and their daughter. The Venetian Senate helped Nicholas' wife with initial donation of 15 ducats and monthly payments of 5 ducats, which was the biggest donation granted to some refugee family from Shkodër. After the Ottomans captured Scutari Nicholas joined his family in Venice. The descendants of Rajko Moneta who took refuge in Venice lived in poverty.   "
"The Ottoboni were an aristocratic Venetian family, who gained prominence in Rome after the 17th century, mainly due to the papacy of Alexander VIII and his cardinal nephew, Pietro Ottoboni, known for his patronage of musicians and painters. [SEP] Cardinal Ottoboni's acceptance of a role representing France at the Holy See was objected to by the Serene Republic, whose senate had not been consulted first. A recent infraction of the rule that no Venetian citizen should serve a foreign power without the express leave of the Serenissima rankled at Venice: Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani had moved to Vienna in 1699 and was appointed viceroy of Naples in 1708.

"The Marquis of Pietrapelosa is a title held by the Gravisi family of Koper (Capodistria), since 1440. [SEP] The name comes from the castle of Pietrapelosa (also called Kostel), at the center of the estate. The Gravisi-Barbabianca Palace and Gravisi-Buttorai Palace in Koper were both family residences.    The first Marquis was Nicolò Gravisi, who foiled a plot in 1435 to betray Padua to Marsilio da Carrara and in return in 1439 received a pension of 400 ducats from the Republic of Venice. From 1440 the pension was reduced to 250 ducats in exchange for the Marquisate of Pietrapelosa, which gave an annual income of 150 ducats. It was the largest estate in Istria, a collection of villages between Koper, Buzet and the border with the Habsburg county. Nicolò Gravisi renovated the Pietrapelosa castle for use as a summer residence. In 1635 a fire destroyed the interior of the castle, but it was restored and inhabited until the 18th century.    Nicolò Gravisi had four sons, each of whom founded branches of the family. In 1446 the Gravisi were admitted to the nobility of Capodistria with the title of Marquis. In 1662 this was confirmed in Venice, and later in Austria by the Emperor Francis I. The family included both scholars and soldiers. Pietro Gravisi (1520–88) commanded a galley during the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, and fought in the War of Siena and against the Ottomans.Lucrezio Gravisi (1558-1613) was a cavalry commander in the army of the Polish King Sigismund III Vasa, who made him a knight for his services in Prussia and Russia.Several of the rectors of the school in Koper were from the family. Giuseppe (1704–74) was a writer and poet. One of the more notable members of the family was the scholar Girolamo Gravisi. Gravisi was born at Pietrapelosa on 15 June 1720. He was a humanist who read widely in Hebrew and Greek, studying theology and also literature. Among his surviving work is a 16-page manuscript on the Lutheran reformer Matthias Flacius, declared a heretic by the Catholic church. Gerolamo's son Dionysius was born in 1750. He was also a scholar and a poet. He made a translation of Voltaire's Alzira which was performed in many theaters in Italy. Dionysius was sickly since childhood and died in Venice in 1768.In 1782 the two branches of the Gravisi family controlled 36% of the olive presses in Koper.  After the olives were badly damaged by cold in the winter of 1782-83, the Senate of Venice called on the patricians in Koper to advance studies of agriculture, particularly of olive groves. Eventually, Marquis Girolamo Gravisi wrote a Memoir on the olive trees in 1794-95. The Republic of Venice fell to the French army led by Napoleon in 1797, with Trieste occupied in April 1797.  The pension paid to the Gravisi was stopped, and the Gravisi started a long correspondence with the Austrians and the French to get it restored. In October 1808 Girolamo Gravisi was named by the French viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais as a candidate for the Senate of the new Kingdom of Italy. He died in Koper on 31 March 1812 aged 92.The Gravis family owned the castle of Pietrapelosa until the final abolition of the feudal system in 1869.

"The Spani (or Span family) was a northern Albanian noble family and clan. [SEP] The center of the family was Drivast, which it ruled holding the titles of Duke and Count. In the late 15th century, a large part of it settled in Venetian territories, primarily Venice itself and Dalmatia. Members of this family lived in a wider region ranging from northern Albania and Montenegro to western Kosovo.    The Spani family was of Albanian origin. The surname Span or Spani probably derives from the Greek word spanos (beardless). In Croatia and Serbia, the surname is transliterated as Spanić and Spanović. Serbian historians including J. Erdeljanović and Petar Šobajić linked the surname with the descendants of the Romanized Illyrian population of Montenegro, although that is considered unlikely as the name is neither related to a particular population nor are all its bearers related.As a family with noble status, the Spani first appear in 1304–1305 as part of the nobility of the Angevin Kingdom of Albania. The territories the family ruled varied from time to time, but Drivast seems to have been their center. In the 1380s, the Balšići had taken over Spani territory, along with much of the rest of northern Albania, all the way to Mirdita and Alessio.After Alfonso V (r. 1416–1458) signed the Treaty of Gaeta with the Albanian leader Skanderbeg in 1451, he signed similar treaties with other chieftains from Albania: Gjergj Arianiti, Gjin Musachia, George Strez Balšić, Peter Spani, Paul Dukagjini, Thopia Musachi, Peter of Himara, Simon Zenevisi and Carlo Tocco who were all, like Skanderbeg, recognized as vassals of the Kingdom of Naples. In the early subdivisions of Albania during the Ottoman era, the region ruled by Pjetër Spani was known in Ottoman Turkish as Petrishpani or I-shpani. Of the branches that migrated to Venetian territories, the one in Venice became extinct by the late 16th century, while the Dalmatian branch mainly found in Korčula was elevated into the ranks of local nobility. In 1455, during the Ottoman conquest of Novo Brdo, Alessio Spani (Serbian:  ) was the last Serbian despot's voivode in the town.    A branch of the family claimed descent from several imperial Byzantine families. In Gjon Muzaka's 1510 work Breve memoria de li discendenti de nostra casa Musachi, Alessio Span is mentioned as a descendant of Emperor Theodosius, although it is unclear to whom it refers as there were three Byzantine emperors named Theodosius.    At the beginning of the 15th century, most notable members of Span family were Marin and his son Peter. Peter's father Marin is mentioned in 1409 as already dead. In 1415, Peter did not have any sons so he decided that he will be inherited by his nephew Marin, a son of his brother Brajko, and ceded several fortresses to him. When the Venetians recaptured Drivast in 1442, Peter Span lost all of his possessions.Peter's brother, Stefan, was appointed by Venetians as the lord of village Podgora in 1406. After Podgora was given to Hoti, Venetians compensated this lost to Stefan and gave him two small villages (Bistriola and Charochi). When Balša III died in 1421, Stefan joined Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarević who recognized his rule over three villages in Drivast.Marin Span was commander of Skanderbeg's forces which lost fortress Baleč to Venetian forces in 1448 during Skanderbeg's war against Venice.

Born to a noble family of Venice on 29 April 1658, Giovanni Francesco Barbarigo was the nephew of Cardinal Gregorio Barbarigo. [SEP] Giovanni Francesco first entered the diplomatic service and was twice sent as representative of the Venetian Republic to the court of King Louis XIV of France. However, he soon turned to an ecclesiastical career, where, if not the great ardor of his vocation, at least illustrious family traditions called him.In 1674 he became Primicerius of the Church of St. Mark at Venice, and the same year, was named by Pope Innocent XII Bishop of Verona. Faced with the difficulties and practical problems of his daily apostolic work, he always returned to the great model that could not help but occupy his mind, that of his great uncle Gregory Barbarigo, who in turn, had taken Charles Borromeo as his model. Thus, in his religious action and in his ecclesiastical activity, the methods and themes that dominated the Venetian Church in its counter-reformation action are seen again. He greatly increased the number of clerics; paying particular attention to the seminaries of the diocese.Prayer, preaching, personal witness of faith, as practical ideals of action of the Counter-Reformation, he was able to translate and apply with commitment and dedication to his Episcopal See. He personally visited hospitals and provided relief in the most diverse situations, such as during an epidemic that struck his diocese in 1702. He provided for the rest of the territories entrusted many missions, which he assigned entirely to the fathers of the Society of Jesus. On every occasion he became a strong supporter of the rights and prerogatives of the Church with regard to power and civil order, defending ecclesiastical immunities with particular attention.He was transferred to Brescia in 1714, created cardinal in 1720, and in 1723 became a successor of his uncle in the See of Padua. He was zealous in promoting the cause of beatification of Gregorio Barbarigo, and lent his encouragement to the production of literary works. To his suggestion was due the inception of the ecclesiastical history of Verona, and the works of St. Zeno, Bishop of Verona (362-380), were reprinted at his expense in Padua, in 1710.Giovanni Francesco Barbarigo died in 1730.

"The Master of the Barbarigo Reliefs was an Italian sculptor active around Venice between about 1486 and about 1515.

These may be seen today in the Ca' d'Oro in Venice; they were formerly on the altar, serving as a double tomb for the Barbarigo family, which once stood in the church of Santa Maria della Carità, which now houses part of the Gallerie dell'Accademia.  The tombs were dismantled in 1808, but other pieces survive, including a kneeling effigy of Doge Agostino Barbarigo in marble and a relief in limestone depicting the Resurrection; another kneeling effigy, depicting Doge Marco Barbarigo, is also known to have at one time existed as part of the tomb.  The complete tomb design is shown in an engraving from 1692; according to this the bronzes were placed on the altar of the central bay, flanked by the kneeling figures on either side.  Further effigies, depicting figures reclining on a bier, were placed in each adjoining bay.  Documentary evidence indicates that work on the sculpture was begun around 1486, at Marco Barbarigo's death; the reliefs were probably completed by 1515.   "

"Francesco Barozzi (in Latin, Franciscus Barocius) (9 August 1537 – 23 November 1604) was an Italian mathematician, astronomer and humanist. [SEP]    Barozzi was born on the island of Crete, at Candia (now Heraklion), at the time a Venetian possession. He was  the son of Iacopo Barozzi, a Venetian nobleman, and Fiordiligi Dorro. Barozzi was educated at Padua, and studied mathematics at the University of Padua.  The estate on Crete, inherited from his father, yielded him an income of 4,000 ducats, though he seems to have lived in Venice for most of his life.  He was thus able to function as an independent scholar, and does not appear to have held any academic posts, although he did lecture on the De sphaera of Sacrobosco at the University of Padua in 1559. Barozzi translated many works of the ancients, including Proclus’s edition of Euclid's Elements (published in Venice in 1560), as well as mathematical works by Hero, Pappus of Alexandria, and Archimedes.     Barozzi helped in the general reappraisal of the geometry of Euclid, and corresponded with numerous mathematicians, including the German Jesuit Christopher Clavius.  His original works include Cosmographia in quatuor libros distributa summo ordine, miraque facilitate, ac brevitate ad magnam Ptolemaei mathematicam constructionem, ad universamque astrologiam institutens (1585), which he dedicated to the Duke of Urbino.  This work concerns the cosmography and mathematical systems of Ptolemy.  Barozzi also discussed 13 ways of drawing a parallel line in his Admirandum illud geometricum problema tredecim modis demonstratum quod docet duas lineas in eodem plano designare, quae nunquam invicem coincidant, etiam si in infinitum protrahantur: et quanto longius producuntur, tanto sibiinuicem propiores euadant (1586). In his Opusculum: in quo una Oratio et due Questiones, altera de Certitude et altera de Medietate Mathematicarum continentur, Barozzi stressed that ""the certitude of mathematics is contained in the syntactic rigor of demonstrations."" Barozzi dedicated this work to Daniele Barbaro.   "

"Palazzo Bembo is a palace in Venice, Italy, on the Grand Canal, close by the Rialto Bridge and next to the Palazzo Dolfin Manin. [SEP]    It was built by the noble family of Bembo in the 15th century. Although it was remodeled several times over the centuries, externally it still maintains the original structure.  The building is on the San Marco side of the Grand Canal, wedged in between Rio di San Salvador and Calle Bembo. Palazzo Bembo is the birthplace of Pietro Bembo (1470–1547), a Venetian scholar, poet, literary theorist, and cardinal. He was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language, specifically Tuscan, as a literary medium. His writings assisted in the 16th century revival of interest in the works of Petrarch. Bembo's ideas were also decisive in the formation of the most important secular musical form of the 16th century, the madrigal. Today the building hosts a hotel and a contemporary art exhibition venue.    The Palazzo’s red façade is decorated with poliforas and combines old Venetian elements with influences from the Byzantine architecture. The facade is considered to be an example of the Venetian Gothic-Byzantine style, a style of architecture originated in 14th-century Venice with the confluence of Byzantine styles from Constantinople, Arab influences from Moorish Spain, and early Gothic forms from mainland Italy. Palazzo Bembo’s 17th century restoration took on influences from that period as it is exhibited in its polychromy, three-part façades, and loggias.    With the thriving of Venice Biennale in the city, Palazzo Bembo is currently known for its Venice Biennale art exhibitions organized by Personal Structures, an international contemporary art platform.

Blessed Matteo da Gimara (c. 1376 – 7 January 1450) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop and a professed member from the Order of Friars Minor; he served as the Bishop of Agrigento from 17 September 1442 until his resignation in mid-1445. [SEP] He was forced to resign due to clerical opposition to his tenure and rumors spread against him forced this resignation. He was noted for his concern towards the poor as well as for his preaching abilities; he was known to have preached in various Italian cities and had support from Pope Eugene IV who was a benefactor. Matteo also preached across Spain on several occasions being close to the monarch (he is alleged to have Spanish origins) before returning to the Italian peninsula to preach and assume his episcopal duties.He was honored for his saintliness in life and death and it later led to Pope Clement XIII approving his equipollent beatification on 22 February 1767.    Matteo Guimerà was born in Agrigento sometime in 1376 and is said to be descended from a Spanish line. It has been debated that his name is Matteo de Zizilia due to an entrance record into the Order of Friars Minor at Bologna dated 30 July 1394 while other hagiographers have suggested that he was named after his grandfather with the surname Sciascia; others suggest Limbeni is his surname.He was sent to Bologna for his theological studies and later to Barcelona in Spain where he was ordained as a priest in 1400.He joined the Order of Friars Minor either in 1391 or 1392 at the San Francesco d'Assisi convent before making his religious profession in 1394. It was after his ordination that he was tasked with preaching in Tarragona and then served as a novice master from 1405 until 1416 (he returned home in 1417). Per King Alfonso V he returned home in the hopes of meeting Saint Bernardino da Siena; the two were said to have met at the order's General Chapter in Mantua in 1418 to which Matteo encouraged and began aiding Bernardino in his Franciscan Observance movement. He also served as the order's provincial vicar from 1425 until 1427 and then as the order's commissioner general for the Sicilian Province from 1432 until 1440. Pope Martin V allowed him in 1425 to establish three convents for the Franciscans and he and Saint Giovanni da Capistrano defended their friend Bernardino before the pope when Bernardino was accused of being a heretic in relation to his devotion to the Sacred Name; Bernardino was acquitted of all the charges leveled against him. This accusation was voiced at the end of Lent in Viterbo in 1426 which prompted Matteo and Giovanni to rush to Rome to plead their case before the pope. Matteo also founded convents in Valencia and Barcelona during the time he spent in Spain from 1427 until 1428 but returned back to his homeland where he founded a convent in Siracusa in 1429 and another at Caltagirone later in 1432. He returned to Spain in 1430 when Queen Maria of Aragon asked him to help make peace between her husband John II (the King of Castile) and his brother. King Alfonso V of Aragon held him in such high esteem that he helped to secure Matteo for a nomination to an Italian bishopric; Pope Eugene IV appointed him in a papal bull on 17 September 1442 as the Bishop of Agrigento. This came after he preached for Lent in 1428 in Valencia and left for the Italian peninsula in April 1430 after concluding his preaching in Tarragona. Matteo was consecrated to the episcopate on 30 June 1443 and set to work to reform clerical standards and to aid the poor in his diocese. His consecration was postponed for several months due to his own opposition to the appointment; he accepted at the pope's insistence and in obedience to him. His care for the poor led some disgruntled clerics to claim that he squandered ecclesial goods for his own benefit. He in fact renounced all ecclesial proceeds to the poor but kept what was needed for him and for the well-being of the diocesan staff. But the disgruntled clerics who opposed him sought to remove him from the diocese and claimed he was engaging in carnal relations with a woman in order to force the pope to take action. He was tried in a papal court but was found innocent; Eugene IV restored his bishopric to him (the pope was a consistent benefactor for Matteo) but the bishop resigned his see even though the allegations were disproved. It is said that Bernardino's counsel also helped him in his decision to resign. The pope provided him with a pension following his resignation as a consolation. Matteo died following a brief illness in Palermo on 7 January 1455 and was interred in the Santa Maria di Gesù church.    Pope Clement XIII beatified Matteo on 22 February 1767.

"Creator Omnium was a bull issued by Pope Eugene IV in 1434 which excommunicated anyone who enslaves Christians of the Canary Islands. [SEP]    Christianity had gained many converts in the Canary Islands by the early 1430s; however the ownership of the lands had been the subject of dispute between Portugal and the Kingdom of Castille. The lack of effective control had resulted in periodic raids on the islands to procure slaves. As early as the Council of Koblenz in 922, the capture of Christians as slaves by other Christians had been condemned.In 1424 Prince Henry of Portugal sent a fleet to invade Gran Canaria. The expedition failed. By 1432 he tried to persuade his father, John I of Portugal, to finance another attempt. However, when his brother, Duarte inherited the throne in 1433, the new king agreed. A landing on Gran Canaria was made in 1434, but repulsed by the native Guanches, and the expedition then plundered the Castilian missions on Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.A complaint was lodged by Fernando Calvetos, the Castilian bishop of San Marcial del Rubicón in Lanzarote, supported by the archbishop of Seville. Calvetos informed the pope of the pillaging carried out by the Portuguese ""pirates"". Pope Eugene IV issued Regimini gregis on 29 September 1434, and Creator Omnium, on 17 December 1434, forbidding any further raids on the Canaries and ordered the immediate manumission of all Christian converts enslaved during the attack.     Creator Omnium alludes to the common humanity between converters and converted. Eugene excommunicated anyone who enslaved newly converted Christians, the penalty to stand until the captive was restored to their liberty and possessions. J. Gordon Melton says that the bull neglects to provide similar protection to those should resist conversion.It is not clear to what extent raiders made a distinction between Christian and non-Christian. Michael Stogre holds that Nicholas intended the ban to protect non-Christians as well, in keeping with the view of Innocent IV that the flock of Christ included ""pagan sheep"" that he ultimately hoped to Christianize.Portuguese soldiers continued to raid the islands during 1435 and Eugene issued a further edict Sicut Dudum that prohibited wars being waged against the islands and affirming the ban on enslavement.

"Illius qui se pro divini is a papal bull issued by Pope Eugene IV in December 1442. [SEP] Eugene granted plenary indulgence to the knights and friars of the Order of Christ, and all other Christians, who fought in the crusade against the Saracens under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator. A clause in the bull ensured that the indulgence would be valid even if Henry was not present in the crusade.   "
"Sicut dudum (English: Just as Long Ago) is a papal bull promulgated by Pope Eugene IV in Florence on January 13, 1435, which forbade the enslavement of local natives in the Canary Islands who had converted or were converting to Christianity. [SEP] Sicut dudum was meant to reinforce Creator Omnium, issued  the previous year, condemning Portuguese slave raids in the Canary Islands.      Christianity had gained many converts in the Canary Islands by the early 1430s. The ownership of the lands had been the subject of dispute between Portugal and the Kingdom of Castille. The lack of effective control had resulted in periodic raids on the islands to procure slaves. Acting on a complaint by Fernando Calvetos, bishop of the islands, Pope Eugene IV issued a papal bull, Creator omnium, on 17 December 1434, annulling previous permission granted to Portugal to conquer those islands still pagan. Eugene excommunicated anyone who enslaved newly converted Christians, the penalty to stand until the captives were restored to their liberty and possessions.    Slave raids continued in the islands during 1435 and Eugene issued a further edict (Sicut dudum) that affirmed the ban on enslavement, and ordered, under pain of excommunication, that all such slaves be immediately set free:  We order and command all and each of the faithful of each sex, within the space of fifteen days of the publication of these letters in the place where they live, that they restore to their earlier liberty all and each person of either sex who were once residents of said Canary Islands, and made captives since the time of their capture, and who have been made subject to slavery. These people are to be totally and perpetually free, and are to be let go without the exaction or reception of money. Eugene went on to say that, ""If this is not done when the fifteen days have passed, they incur the sentence of excommunication by the act itself, from which they cannot be absolved, except at the point of death, even by the Holy See, or by any Spanish bishop, or by the aforementioned Ferdinand, unless they have first given freedom to these captive persons and restored their goods."" The specific reference to Spanish bishops and Bishop Ferdinand of San Marcial del Rubicón in Lanzarote suggests that the Portuguese were not the only ones engaged in slave raids in the Canaries. Joel S. Panzer views Sicut dudum as a significant condemnation of slavery, issued sixty years before the Europeans found the New World.Eugene tempered Sicut dudum with another bull (15 September 1436) due to the complaints made by King Duarte of Portugal, that allowed the Portuguese to conquer any unconverted parts of the Canary Islands. The king suggested that Portugal be authorized to evangelize and civilize the islands, as other less reputable persons were unlikely to heed the pontiff. Political weakness compelled the Renaissance Papacy to adopt an acquiescent and unchallenging position when approached for requests for privileges in favour of these ventures. Without a navy of his own to police the islands, the Pope opted in favor of the Portuguese as the lesser of two evils.In 1476 Pope Sixtus IV reiterated the concerns expressed in ""Sicut dudum"" in his papal bull, Regimini gregis, in which he threatened to excommunicate all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians.

"Crucifixion is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Giovanni Bellini, created around 1455–1460. [SEP] It is housed in the Museo Correr in Venice. The work was originally in the church of San Salvador of Venice, and is part of the Mantegna-influenced phase of Bellini's early career.    The painting shows the crucified Jesus, portrayed with a very pale skin, on a broad landscape background. The deep blue sky is populated by cherubims who are weeping his death. In the lower part are Mary and St. John.  The background shows several details, including a lake with a wooden bridge, a quarry, small houses and a series of small working figures. Such a fragmented, detailed composition was typical of Jacopo Bellini, the artist's father, and was replaced by a more coherent one in Bellini's later works. Other elements typical of his early works are the rather crude painting strokes, the thin figures and the sharp lines.    Transfiguration of Christ (Bellini)   "

The palace was renovated, modified and extended over the following centuries, finally taking on its current aspect in the 18th Century. In fact many of the valuable interior decorations date back to the 18th Century. Past guests to the palace included important historic figures such as Tsar Paul I of Russia, Joséphine de Beauharnais and Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. Palazzo Pisani Moretta remained in the Pisani family until it died out in 1880 but the building is still owned privately. The interior rooms were decorated by Baroque artists such as Tiepolo, Jacopo Guarana, Gaspare Diziani and Giuseppe Angeli.

"Francesco Pisani (1494 – 28 June 1570) was an Italian Cardinal, born in Venice, the son of Alvise Pisani the noted banker, who was Procurator of S. Mark's, a member of the Council of Ten, and a Councilor of the Doge of Venice; and Cecilia Giustinian. [SEP]  He had a brother named Giovanni (Zuan), who also became Procurator of S. Marks' and was a Venetian diplomat; he was married to the sister of Doge Andrea Gritti.  He was a strong supporter of the alliance between Venice, France and the Papacy, called the League of Cognac.  He shared the imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in the Castel S. Angelo during the Sack of Rome and its aftermath.  He spent eighteen months in exile in Naples while Clement made his peace with the Emperor Charles V.    Nothing is known about his education. Francesco had been named a Protonotary Apostolic, the highest grade of monsignor, giving him the rank of a prelate. He was created a cardinal-deacon by Pope Leo X, in the Consistory of 1 July 1517, at the request of Doge Leonardo Loredan, and assigned the Deaconry of S. Teodoro.  The red hat is said to have cost his father 20,000 gold ducats and a ruby. The new cardinal was not in Rome at the time, and the red hat was brought to him in Venice; it was presented on Sunday, 23 August 1517. On 27 August 1518, the Venetian Council voted to give possession of the Benedictine abbey of S. Stefano di Spalato, on the death of its abbot, to Cardinal Pisani.  Pisani was appointed Bishop of Padua on 8 August 1524.In 1526, during the invasion of the city of Rome on 20-21 September, led by Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, Pisani sheltered the Venetian Ambassador in the Palazzo Venezia.  On 28 September 1526, he was named Administrator of the diocese of Città Nova (Aemonensis, in Istria), which he finally resigned in 1535.    On 27 February 1527, Cardinal Pisani was granted the Deaconry of S. Maria in Porticu. He was promoted Cardinal-Deacon of San Marco, the traditional Venetian church in Rome, which is normally the titulus of a cardinal-priest, on 3 May 1527 by Pope Clement VII, just three days before the Sack of Rome began.  He kept the Deaconry of S. Maria in Porticu in commendam.  Two days later he was finally consecrated bishop.On the morning of 6 May, as the assault on Rome began, Cardinal Pisani was at the Vatican Palace, to participate in the Pope's morning Mass.  He was with the Pope to witness the assault, and fled with the Pope through the covered passage to the Castel S. Angelo.   He was Pope Clement's fellow prisoner in the Castel S. Angelo during the Sack of Rome in May 1527, and its aftermath.  In September 1527, Giovanni (Zuan) Pisani, the brother of Cardinal Francesco, reported to the Signoria of Venice that he had word that the Pope had appointed his brother Archbishop of Vienne, and that the Pope was writing to the King of France for his consent.  Pope Clement finally concluded a treaty (i.e. surrendered) to the Spanish at the end of November.  At the beginning of December 1527, the two leaders of the French and Venetian factions in the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Pisani and Cardinal Trivulzio, were taken to Gaeta, and from there sent to Naples as hostages for the Pope's good behavior.  It was reported to the Signoria of Venice that, on 2 December 1527 Cardinal Pisani freely renounced the See of Padua in favor of his nephew Alvise di Giovanni Pisani; the Signoria ordered the Rector of Padua to hand over the diocese either to Alvise (Luigi) Pisani or his Procurator.  The younger Alviso was only twelve years old, and his uncle the Cardinal continued to administer the diocese until his own death.  On 27 January 1528, Cardinal Pisani was appointed Administrator of the diocese of Treviso.  Nonetheless, Cardinal Francesco was a hostage for the good behavior of the Pope, being kept in Naples for eighteen months. Pisani's father, Alvise, was Commissary General of the French-Venetian armies fighting the Spanish in the Kingdom of Naples, where he died of disease in August 1528.    In 1529 Cardinal Pisani obtained the Deaconry of Sant' Agata in Suburra, probably in commendam, since he continued to style himself Cardinal Deacon of S. Marco.  He held the Deaconry until 1545.On 1 April 1535 Cardinal Francesco Pisano, Cardinal Deacon of S. Marco, who was possessor of the faculty of disposing of certain benefices in the Cathedrals of Padua and Treviso, which had been granted him by Popes Clement VII and Paul III, renounced those privileges in order to conform with the desire of the Signoria of Venice.In 1550 Cardinal Juan Alvarez de Toledo was promoted from the Deaconry of S. Maria in Porticu to the priestly titulus of S. Sisto. Consequently, the Deaconry of  S. Maria in Porticu was given back to Cardinal Pisani in commendam, and he held it until he was promoted to the Cardinal-Bishopric of Albano.Cardinal Pisani was nominated Administrator of the diocese of Narbonne by King Henri II of France, which was confirmed on 11 May 1551.    On 10 April 1555, as senior Cardinal Deacon, Cardinal Pisani crowned Pope Marcellus II (Cervini). It was Wednesday in Holy Week, and therefore the ceremony was very simple.  Cervini had been elected earlier on the same day, and immediately consecrated a bishop in the Cappella Paolina by the Bishop of Ostia, Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa.  Pope Marcellus II died during the night between April 30 and May 1, after a reign of only twenty-two days.On 23 May 1555, Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa was elected pope, and chose the name Paul IV. He was crowned on the steps of the Vatican Basilica on Sunday, 26 May, by Cardinal Francesco Pisani, the prior Diaconum.    With his election to the Papacy, Cardinal Carafa left the See of Ostia vacant.  It was filled by Cardinal Jean du Bellay.  Bellay's seat at Porto was then filled by Cardinal Rodolfo Pio de Carpi, Bishop of Tusculum.  The then vacant See of Tusculum was taken by Cardinal Juan Álvarez de Toledo, leaving his seat at Albano vacant.  Cardinal Pisani was promoted Cardinal-bishop of Albano on 29 May 1555 by Pope Paul IV, then, on the death of Cardinal Alvarez, he was promoted Cardinal-bishop of Frascati (Tusculum)  on 20 September  1557. Pius IV promoted him Cardinal-bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina on 18 May 1562 when Rodolfo Pio became Bishop of Ostia, and then Cardinal Pisani himself became Cardinal-bishop of Ostia on 12 May 1564.Cardinal Francesco Pisani participated as Bishop of Tusculum (Frascati) in the Conclave of 1559, an event that lasted nearly four months.  It was notorious for the extreme laxity of security. On 5 December, the traditional rule that went back to Pope Gregory X (1274) was put into effect, limiting the cardinals to one dish at a meal was put into effect. Finally on Christmas Day, after the French and Spanish factions had both exhausted their resources, Cardinal Giovanni Angelo de' Medici was elected by acclamation, and a formal scrutiny was taken the next day. He chose to be called Pius IV.On 10 June 1564, Pope Pius IV granted the Serene Republic of Venice the Palazzo of S. Marco in Rome, on the condition that the Cardinal of S. Marco could reside there, and that the transfer was not to take place until after the death of Cardinal Francesco Pisani, Bishop of Ostia, or with his consent.Cardinal Pisani also took part in the Conclave of 1565-1566, this time as Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals.  He was the senior cardinal present, and the only cardinal who survived from the reign of Leo X.  He was considered papabile, but he had no great following.   On 7 January 1566, mostly through the work of Cardinals Carlo Borromeo and Alessandro Farnese, the cardinals elected Cardinal Michele Ghislieri, who took the throne name Pius V.The Cardinal was a patron of the arts.  He commissioned a house on the mainland in Montagnana, the Villa Pisani, from Andrea Palladio. He also commissioned an altarpiece for the Cathedral of Montagnana, Santa Maria Assunta, from Paolo Veronese, who was resident in Montagnana in 1555.  The subject was the Transfiguration of Christ. Cardinal Pisani died in Rome, at his palazzo of S. Marco, on 28 June 1570, at the age of seventy-six, having been a cardinal for fifty-three years.  He was buried in the Basilica of S. Marco in Rome.A statue of Cardinal Francesco Pisani, not done from life, is No. 70 in the Prato della valle in Padua; the statues were carved ca. 1775-1883.   "
"Luigi Pisani (1522 – 3 June 1570) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal. [SEP]    Luigi (Alvise) Pisani was born in Venice in 1522, the son of Giovanni Pisani, future Ambassador of the Republic of Venice to the Kingdom of France (1531), and his wife Benedetta Gritti. His mother was the sister of Andrea Gritti, Doge of Venice, and his father was the brother of Cardinal Francesco Pisani.When his uncle, Cardinal Francesco Pisani, who had been Bishop of Padua since 1524, resigned the See on 2 December 1527, he did so in favor of his nephew Luigi. At his tender age, Luigi was too young to be a bishop (the minimum canonical age being twenty-five), and thus the diocese needed an Administrator, who turned out to be his uncle the Cardinal. The Cardinal, therefore, was able to pursue his activities at the Papal Court (which was in exile at the time) and still collect a share of the revenues of the diocese and control over the awarding of benefices. This arrangement continued until 1555. He succeeded as Administrator of the diocese of Padua in 1555, on the resignation of his uncle, Cardinal Francesco Pisani, who had been promoted Bishop of Albano by the new Pope, Paul IV (Carafa). There is no reference to Luigi's taking holy orders or being consecrated a bishop, but his succession to the Diocese in 1555 may have forced the issue. In the meantime he had moved to Rome, becoming a Cleric in the Apostolic Camera. This position was for sale, and he or his family probably purchased the office. He rose in the hierarchy of the Apostolic Chamber to the office of praefectus annonae, ninth in rank, dealing with the finances of the provisioning of the Papal Court and the City of Rome. He held that post from August 1561 until May 1562.In 1562-63, he was a participant in the Council of Trent, which would imply that he was certainly a bishop by 1562. Pope Pius IV made him a cardinal priest in his fourth Consistory for the creation of cardinals on 12 March 1565. Pope Pius died on 9 December 1565, before Luigi had been invested with a titular church. He participated in the papal conclave of 1565-66 that elected Pope Pius V. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Vitale on 8 February 1566. On 2 June 1568 he opted for the titular church of San Marco.On 14 January 1569 he was elected to succeed Cardinal Giacomo Savelli as Chamberlain of the Sacred College of Cardinals. He served the usual one-year term, and was succeeded on 14 January 1570 by Cardinal Philibert Babou de la Bourdaisière. He was never (as some report) Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church. He died in Venice on 3 June 1570, at the age of forty-eight, three weeks before his uncle, Cardinal Francesco Pisani. He was buried in the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Venice.   "

"John IV Crispo or Giovanni IV (1500-1564), was the sovereign Duke of the Archipelago, ruling from 1517, when he succeeded Francesco III Crispo (r. 1500–11). He was succeeded in 1564 by the last Duke, Giacomo IV Crispo. [SEP]       John IV Crispo was the son of Francesco III Crispo; his mother was Taddea Caterina Loredano, sister of Antonio Loredano. His father was reportedly insane, and in 1511, he murdered his mother in a fit of insanity. The murder caused a rebellion among the Naxians who deposed Francesco in favor of his eleven year old son. When told of the rebellion, his father reportedly attacked his son with a knife, and John IV was forced to flee from a balcony to escape his father. The Naxians asked the Republic of Venice for support against Francesco III, and the Venetians had Francesco seized and deported in captivity to Venetian Crete, while John IV was placed under the guardianship of his maternal uncle Antonio Loredano, who ruled the Duchy as Venetian governor during the minority of John IV.    In 1517, John IV Crispo reached legal majority and the Venetian administration of the Duchy under his uncle ceased. Not long after this, he was abducted by  a Turkish corsair while hunting.  He was released by ransom and the support of Venice, but the ransom had a draining effect on his finances.   A Venetian testimony described him: ""The young duke, is surrounded by evil counsellors; his island is weak, his castle strong, but badly armed.""   He made an unsuccessful attempt to incorporate Paros in his domain, but the rights of Fiorenza Sommaripa was protected by his ally Venice.   John IV Crispo supported the Knights of Rhodes during the Siege of Rhodes (1522) with provisions.During the first decades of his reign, the Duchy was protected by the peace treaty between the Ottomans and Venice, as Venice was the ally and protector of the Duchy.  It was tormented by corsairs, however. In 1532, the Turkish corsair Kurtoglu threatened Naxos, with a fleet of pirates, and Naxos was forced to buy itself free from looting, as was Paros and Sifanto.In 1536, France and the Ottoman Empire made a treaty of alliance against Venice. The following year, war broke out between Venice and the Ottoman Empire, who attacked the Venetian islands and allies in Greece under command of Khaireddin Barbarossa. The Ottoman fleet under Barbarossa conquered one island after another; the Venetian islands of Cerigo and Egina, Cyclades, the principalities of Seriphos, Nio, Namfio, Antiparos, Stampalia and Amorgos, all ruled by Venetian dynasties, were all incorporated in the Ottoman Empire.After the Ottomans took Paros in 1537, they attacked Naxos, the main island of the Duke of the Archipelago. Upon the sight of the Turkish fleet, the inhabitants all took refuge in the capital, leaving goods and chattels behind them. When the Ottomans landed, the island was looted and buildings destroyed.  The Turkish commander sent a Christian emissary to the duke with the message:  ""If, you will voluntarily submit yourself and your islands to the emperor, already master of Asia and ere long of all Europe too, you may easily obtain his favour. If not, then I bid you expect his hatred and indignation. If you surrender, all your possessions shall be saved; but if you refuse, we will send you, your wife and children, your fellow-countrymen and subjects, to destruction to gether. We have a powerful fleet, a vigorous and victorious soldiery, and an admirable siege equipment. Take warning and counsel, then, from the Eginetans, the Parians, and the other lords of the Cyclades. You are fortunate to be able, if you choose wisely, to profit by the misfortunes of your neighbors.""   As it was not possible to resist, and no help from Europe was expected, John IV Crispo and his council on 5 November 1537 surrendered, promised to pay an annual tribute of 5000 ducats and subject to the sultan, to avoid slavery.   Nevertheless, the Ottomans did loot the island of 25,000 ducats' worth of booty, and reportedly the duke ""already foresaw that, unless Christendom  would unite against the Turk, in a few years' time he would share the same fate which had, eighty years before, befallen the last Greek emperor of Constantinople"".The duke sent an appeal to ""Pope Paul III.; the Emperor Charles V. ; Ferdinand, King of the Romans; Francois I. of France; and the other Christian kings and princes"", in which he urged to them to unite against their common enemy, the Ottoman sultan, who planned to conquer them all by separating them, to avoid sharing his fate.  His appeal to the powers of Europe was however unsuccessful.    After the Peace Treaty of 1540 between Venice and the Ottoman Empire, only very few states in the archipelago: the Duchy, Andros and Kythnos remained, and Venice were able to keep only a few of its former colonies, such as Crete and Tenos.  With Ottoman support, John IV Crispo deposed the Premarini dynasty from their domain of Zia and bestowed it as well as Mykonos to his daughter upon her marriage to Gian Francesco Sommaripa of Andros.After having become a vassal of the Ottomans, John IV Crispo experienced a growing unpopularity among the Greek population of the Duchy. The rule of the Latin Catholic crusader elite was not popular among the Greek Orthodox population, and when the Latin dynasties themselves were subjected to the Muslim Ottomans, their authority over the Greek quickly deteriorated, particularly since the duke was forced to raise taxes to pay the tributes due to the sultan.   In 1559, a rebel by the name Mamusso of Candia proclaimed: ""It was disgraceful, that so many valiant Greeks should allow their religion to be insulted and their country to be governed by a mere handful of Franks"",  and John IV banished the Orthodox metropolitan of Paronaxia for sedition and for supporting this view.  The patriarch applied to the Ottoman grand vizier to oust the Catholic hierarchy, who had a bad reputation on the island because of its many scandals, and John IV therefore decided to only appoint local people to Catholic bishops and friars as they would be better accepted.In 1563, the Duchy was described by a Venetian commissioner's report: ""The islands of Zia, Siphnos, and Andros  have their own lords (the Sommaripa and the Gozzadini), but are tributaries of the sultan; the other sixteen islands are under the duke, but of these, only five — Naxos, Santorin, Melos, Syra, and Paros — are inhabited. The Duke of Naxos, a man of nearly seventy, is, in point of dignity, the Premier Duke of Christendom; but, despite his title, he is duke more in name than in fact; for in all things the Grand Turk and his ministers are practically supreme. Every year, when the Turkish captains arrive, the duke's subjects bring their complaints against him before them, so that he dare not punish his own dependents for their crimes, nor even for their offences against his own person. He dresses and lives like a pauper, without the least pomp or princely expenditure ; for, though he raises from 9000 to 10,000 ducats a year out of his islands, he has to pay 4000 ducats as tribute to the sultan, and his sole thought is how he can save money with which to bribe the Turkish captains and ministers. Under these circumstances, his administration is rather the shadow of a principality than a government.""During his later years of reign, he allowed his eldest son Francesco to participate in government, but he predeceased him, and he was therefore succeeded by his second son.    He was married to Adriana Gozzadini, related to the Gozzadini dynasty of Zia, which were traditional allies of Naxos.

"The Two Foscari: An Historical Tragedy (1821) is a verse play in five acts by Lord Byron. [SEP] The plot, set in Venice in the mid-15th century, is loosely based on the true story of the downfall of doge Francesco Foscari and his son Jacopo. Byron's play formed the basis of Verdi's opera I due Foscari.    Jacopo Foscari, son of the Doge of Venice, has twice been exiled, once for corruption and once for complicity in the murder of Donato, a member of the Council of Ten. He has been recalled from his second exile to answer the capital charge of treason, and as the play opens he is between sessions of interrogation on the rack. The Council decide to sentence him to a third exile, this time perpetual, rather than to death. His father, doge Francesco Foscari, signs the sentence of exile, though his spirit is broken by this new disgrace. Jacopo's patriotic spirit cannot brook such a sentence, he longs to die, and he duly does die of a broken heart. The Council of Ten orders the doge to abdicate, and, as the bells begin to toll to signify the election of a new doge, the old one falls and dies.     Byron wrote The Two Foscari in Ravenna in less than a month, between 12 June and 9 July 1821.  It was published by John Murray on 19 December 1821 in the same volume as his Sardanapalus and Cain. Byron originally intended to dedicate The Two Foscari to his friend Sir Walter Scott, but in the event he transferred that dedication to Cain and left Foscari without one. He added an appendix to The Two Foscari in which he launched a stinging attack on what he considered the hypocrisies of the Poet Laureate, Robert Southey. Southey responded in a letter to a London newspaper in which he dared Byron to attack him again. Byron initially wanted to challenge Southey to a duel, but then turned instead to poetry and wrote his stinging satire The Vision of Judgment.    Verdi's opera I due Foscari, with a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave, was based on Byron's play.  It also inspired two paintings, Les deux Foscari by Delacroix, and L'ultimo abboccamento di Jacopo Foscari con la propria famiglia prima di partire per l'esilio cui era stato condannato by Francesco Hayez.

"Bartholomew II Ghisi (Italian: Bartolommeo Ghisi; died 1341) was a Latin feudal lord in medieval Greece, lord of Tinos and Mykonos, Triarch of Negroponte and Grand Constable of the Principality of Achaea. [SEP]     Bartholomew was the son of George I Ghisi and Alice dalle Carceri. His father died at the Battle of the Cephissus against the Catalan Company in 1311. As Bartholomew was underage, his mother assumed the regency while he was still minor, until her own death two years later. By 11 June 1315, Bartholomew II Ghisi was in direct control of his domains. From his father, Bartholomew inherited the lordship of Tinos, Mykonos, and parts of Kea and Serifos in the Duchy of Naxos, and from his mother one of the triarchies of Euboea (according to Raymond-Joseph Loenertz the central triarchy of Chalkis), while his father's other possession by his first wife, the Barony of Chalandritsa in the Principality of Achaea, returned to a member of the Dramelay family, Nicholas of Dramelay. At some unspecified date, Batholomew married a daughter of the Grand Constable of Achaea, Engilbert of Liederkerque, and had a son, George II Ghisi.From 1317 to 1327 Bartholomew and his fellow triarchs, backed by the Venetians, confronted the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens for the domination in Euboea. In spring 1317, Andrea Corner, ruler of one sixth of Euboea, allowed 2,000 Catalans entry into the city of Chalkis. The Catalans were expelled from the city following the intervention of Venice, but the situation on the island remained complicated following the death of Boniface of Verona, lord of Karystos. His daughter, Marulla of Verona, disputed Boniface's inheritance with her half-brother Thomas. Marulla was married with the Catalan leader Alfonso Fadrique, whose men occupied the disputed castles. Venetian mediation led to the signing of a truce of all involved parties on 19 June 1319; Bartholomew signed it along with the Venetian Bailo of Negroponte, Francesco Dandolo, John de Noyer de Maisey, triarch of the southern third of Euboea, Pietro dalle Carceri and Andrea Corner, lords of the two northern sixths of the island, and Alfonso Fadrique for the Catalans.Bartholomew later came to hold the post of Grand Constable of the Principality of Achaea as well, probably through his marriage, although he does not appear to have had lands in the principality. He held this post in 1320, when the Byzantine governor of Mystras, Andronikos Asen, invaded the territory of Achaea. As a vassal of the Prince of Achaea, Bartholomew Ghisi participated in the army sent against the Byzantines, but in a battle on 9 September at the castle of Saint George, he was taken prisoner, along with several high-ranking nobles of the Principality, and was sent to Constantinople. He remained captive for some years and was released in 1325, although on 11 May 1321 he appears among the signatories of a new truce with the Catalans in Chalkis.In 1326/27, he reached a rapprochement with the Catalans, sealed by the marriage of his son George II to Simona of Aragon, daughter of the Catalan vicar-general Alfonso Fadrique. Bartholomew received—probably as Simona's dowry—half the castellany of the Castle of Saint Omer in Thebes, which he held until its destruction in c. 1331/34. This pro-Catalan attitude led to remonstrances by Venetian officials. At the same time (1326/27) he had a conflict for unknown reasons with the Duke of Naxos Nicholas I Sanudo and was therefore condemned by the Venetian bailo of Negroponte, who confiscated some of his goods while his wife was imprisoned (by the bailo or Sanudo). The affair was judged several times at Venice but its final outcome remains unknown; however Bartholomew must have regained his standing with Venice since he was included in its truce with the Catalans in 1331.In 1328, Bartholomew and his brother Marino sold their share of Kea (half the island) to Ruggiero Premarin. In 1331/32, Bartholomew reverted to an hostile attitude toward the Catalans (perhaps partly because of the dismissal of Alfonso Fadrique from the post of vicar-general) and backed Walter VI of Brienne in his abortive attempt to enforce his ancestral claims on the Duchy of Athens. It was precisely in order to avoid the Castle of Saint Omer falling in Brienne's hands that the Catalans destroyed it. According to the prologue of the French version of the Chronicle of the Morea, it derives from a prototype that Bartholomew held at the Castle of Saint Omer. It is therefore likely that Bartholomew owned be the original version of the Chronicle, whose versions in various languages are the major primary source about the history of Frankish Greece.Bartholomew II Ghisi died in 1341.

"George II Ghisi (Italian: Giorgio Ghisi; died c. 1344/5 or 1352) was a Latin feudal lord in medieval Greece, lord of Tinos and Mykonos and Triarch of Negroponte.

In 1326/27, as part of his father's rapprochement with the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens, George married Simona of Aragon, the daughter of the Catalan vicar-general Alfonso Fadrique. As Simona's dowry, the Ghisi received half the castellany of the Castle of Saint Omer in Thebes, which they held until its destruction in c. 1331/34. Bartholomew II died in 1341, and George succeeded him. In 1343, at the request of Pope Clement VI, he armed a galley conjointly with John I Sanudo (duke of Naxos) and Balzana Gozzadini (regent of the two other thirds of Negroponte) to join the first Smyrniote crusade. According to Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, his disappearance from the sources after the events of 1344/45 could suggest that he may have participated in person and died in the fighting, as did the leaders Henry of Asti, Martino Zaccaria and the Venetian admiral Pietro Zeno. However, the date of 1352 was proposed (without justification) by Karl Hopf in the 19th century.He was followed by his son, Bartholomew III Ghisi, who was still a minor, under the regency of his mother Simona until 1358.

"Agostino Giustiniani (born Pantaleone Giustiniani; 1470 -  1536) was an Italian Catholic  bishop, linguist and geographer. [SEP]    Giustiniani was born at Genoa into a noble family. His father had been ambassador of the Republic of Genoa at Milan, while his grandfather had been governor of Chios.  Giustiniani spent some  years in Valencia, Spain, before joining the Dominican order in 1487. He studied  Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic, and in 1514 began the preparation of a polyglot edition of the Bible. As Bishop of Nebbio in Corsica, he took part in some of the earlier sittings of the Lateran council (1516–1517), but, in consequence of party complications, withdrew to his diocese, and ultimately to France, where he became a pensioner of Francis I, and was the first to occupy a chair of Hebrew and Arabic in the University of Paris.  After an absence from Corsica for a period of five years, during which he visited England and the Low Countries, and became acquainted with Erasmus and Sir Thomas More, he returned to Nebbio, about 1522, and there remained, with comparatively little intermission, until in 1536, when, while returning from a visit to Genoa, he perished in a storm at sea. He was the possessor of a very fine library, which he bequeathed to the republic of Genoa. Of his projected polyglot only the Psalter was published (Psalterium Hebraeum, Graecum, Arabicum, et Chaldaicum, Genoa, 1516). Besides the Hebrew text, the Septuagint translation, the Chaldee paraphrase, and an Arabic version, it contains the Vulgate translation, a new Latin translation by the editor, a Latin translation of the Chaldee paraphrase, and a collection of scholia. Giustiniani printed 2,000 copies at his own expense, including fifty in vellum for presentation to the sovereigns of Europe and Asia; but the sale of the work did not encourage him to proceed with the New Testament, which he had also prepared for the press.  Besides an edition of the Book of Job, containing the original text, the Vulgate, and a new translation, he published a Latin version of The Guide for the Perplexed of Maimonides (Moreh Nevukhim, Director dubitantium aut perplexorum, 1520), and also edited in Latin the Aureus libellus of Aeneas Platonicus, and the Timaeus of Chalcidius. In 1526-1530 he wrote a description of Corsica entitle Dialogo nominato Corsica. His annals of Genoa (Castigatissimi Annali di Genova) were published posthumously in 1537.   "

"Olimpia Giustiniani (18 May 1641 – 27 December 1729) was an Italian noblewoman of the houses of Giustiniani and Barberini. [SEP] She was the granddaughter of Olimpia Maidalchini, grand-niece of Pope Innocent X and wife of Maffeo Barberini, Prince of Palestrina.    Giustiniani was born on 18 May 18, 1641 at the Palazzo Pamphili to Andrea Giustiniani and Anna Maria Flaminia Pamphili, of the powerful Giustiniani and Pamphili families. Her great-uncle, Pope Innocent X (Giovanni Battista Pamphili of the Pamphili family), was the brother-in-law of her maternal grandmother, papal power-broker Olimpia Maidalchini.    Olimpia Giustiniani was married in 1653 to Maffeo Barberini, son of Taddeo Barberini (who died in exile in Paris), future Prince of Palestrina and heir to the Barberini estate.The marriage, which reconciled the Barberini and Pamphili families, was engineered by Guistiniani's maternal grandmother, Olimpia Maidalchini, and Barberini's uncle, Cardinal Antonio Barberini, several years after the Barberini were forced into exile by an investigation instigated by Pope Innocent X following the Wars of Castro. Maidalchini, realizing her influence over Pope Innocent was waning, arranged the marriage to facilitate a return of the Barberini to Rome in order to curry favor with a number of the Barberini family's cardinals. The Barberini, too, were keen to return to Rome and were enthusiastic about Maidalchini's plan to marry Pope Innocent's grand-niece, Guistiniani, into their family. Despite the fact that 12-year-old Guistiniani stubbornly refused to marry her 22-year-old suitor, surprising few, the two were married at a lavish ceremony celebrated by Pope Innocent himself. After the ceremony, however, the child refused to go home with her new groom to allow the marriage to be consummated. Her mother, who had barely been involved in her upbringing, appealed to her by telling her that other girls were forced to marry decrepit old men and that, by comparison, Barberini was a far better option. When the child still refused, Maidalchini forced her granddaughter into a carriage that took her to the Palazzo Barberini and a new life as a daughter of the Barberini.By marriage, Olimpia became sister-in-law to both Cardinal Carlo Barberini and Lucrezia Barberini, who subsequently married Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena.    Maffeo Barberini and Olimpia Giustiniani had five children:  Costanza Barberini (1655–1687), married duke Francesco Caetani of Caserta in 1680 Camilla Barberini (1657–1740), married count Carlo Borromeo-Arese in 1689 Francesco Barberini (1662–1738), cardinal from 1690 Urbano Barberini (1664–1722), who would inherit the titles of his father in 1685 Taddeo Barberini (1666–1702), married Maria Teresa Muti in 1701 but died childless.

"Orazio Giustiniani (28 February 1580 – 25 July 1649) was an Italian Catholic Cardinal. [SEP]    Giustiniani was born  the Island of Chios, then part of the Republic of Genoa, to the powerful Giustiniani family. He was a relative of two Bishops of Chio - Girolamo Giustiniani (1599–1604) and Marco Giustiniani (1604–1640). He entered the Congregation of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri in 1603, only 8 years after the death of Philip Neri. He was named, by Cardinal Antonio Barberini (brother of then-Pope Urban VIII), superintendent of the abbey of Farfa and custodian of the Vatican Library in 1630.In 1627, the Congregation of Propaganda Fide proposed sending Giustiniani to Ancona for secret talks with Cyril Lucaris, patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Church leaders were concerned by news Lucaris was trying to reform his reform of Orthodox church along Protestant and Calvinist lines. Lucaris had already been opposed by those within his own communion and by the Jesuits but the Church planned to send Giusitniani to secretly negotiate recognition of Lucaris as the legitimate Roman Catholic Church-backed patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church.Giustiniani refused, citing a desire to remain with his Oratory congregation. He refused the mission again on at least one other occasion but was finally convinced to travel to Ancona in 1635. However, by the time Giustiniani arrived, Lucaris had made a confession of faith which concerned Roman Church leadership and he was met by Atanasio Patelerio, a rival of Lucaris who claimed to have control of Constantinople and the Eastern Church. He returned later that year to Rome (via Venice) to present Patelerio to the Pope to be recognized as legitimate patriarch. Pope Urban VIII was not convinced and instead entrusted the decision to a panel of advisors including his brother (and Giustiniani mentor), Antonio Barberini. There are reports Patelerio hurt his own chances by later going into Rome and blessing the people with a cross raised above his head; actions that created confusion and concern among the citizenry. Giustiniani returned to Ancona with Patelerio and suggested he should make his own confession to gain favour with the Pope. Patelerio did so but it did not prevent Lucaris from being restored as Patriarch yet again. Giustiniani returned to Rome and to his position as custodian of the Vatican Library. He was consecrated on 16 September 1640, in Rome, by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Pamphili and was appointed Bishop of Nocera. Four years later, Pamphili was elected to the Papal Throne as Pope Innocent X and Giustiniani was elevated to Cardinal on 6 March 1645. He served as Librarian of the Holy Roman Church from 25 September 1646 until his death and Major Penitentiary from 4 December 1647 until his death. Giustiniani died on 25 July 1649 and was buried in the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella, a church of his Congregation of the Oratory.    While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of: Domenico Carnevale, Bishop of Isola (1646); Stefano Martini, Bishop of Noli (1646); Mario Montani, Bishop of Nocera Umbra (1646); Ignazio Ciantes, Bishop of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi e Bisaccia (1647);and the principal co-consecrator of: Niccolò Albergati-Ludovisi, Archbishop of Bologna (1645).    Little is known of Giustiniani's immediate family but it seems certain there was some form of familial link to Olimpia Giustiniani, her grandmother Olimpia Maidalchini and grand-uncle Giovanni Battista Pamphili (later Pope Innocent X who elevated Orazio Giustiniani to cardinal). Olimpia married Maffeo Barberini, great-nephew of Antonio Barberini and   Pope Urban VIII.   "
"The Palazzo Giustinian is a palace in Venice, northern Italy, situated in the Dorsoduro district and overlooking the Grand Canal next to Ca' Foscari. [SEP] It is among the best examples of the late Venetian Gothic and was the final residence of Princess Louise of Artois.     The edifice was built in the late 15th century, perhaps with the participation of Bartolomeo Bon. The palace consisted originally of two separated sectors, one for each branch of the family, which were later joined by a façade; these are the Ca' Giustinian dei Vescovi (now housing part of the Ca' Foscari University) and the Ca' Giustinian dalle Zogie (now privately owned). Behind the façade, they are separated by an alley which, through a sottoportego, or portico-tunnel, connects to the central portal. The two sub-palaces share numerous decorative features with the annexed Ca' Foscari. They have an L-shaped plan with four floors, the upper ones having mullioned windows. At the piano nobile they form a six-arches arcade with an interwoven motif of multi-lobes circles. The single windows are ogival, or decorated with a three-lobe motif.

[SEP]    Vincenzo's father, Giuseppe Giustiniani, had been the last Genoese ruler of the Aegean island of Chios, which had been a family possession for centuries. In 1566 the island was lost to the Ottomans, and Vincenzo and his elder brother Benedetto were taken by their father to Rome, where an uncle was already a cardinal. Giuseppe Giustiniani became a banker, and by his death in 1600 was financier to the Vatican and one of the richest men in Rome. Vincenzo Giustiniani followed his father into the family business, while Benedetto entered the Church and became a cardinal himself, 16 November 1586. Both brothers were keen art patrons, and the collection they established became one of the most important in its age. On Giustiniani's death - Benedetto died in 1621 - it contained over 300 paintings (15 by Caravaggio) and more than 1200 pieces of sculpture, and the various catalogues constitute an invaluable resource for early 17th-century art. In 1631, the Galleria Giustiniani was published under supervision of Joachim von Sandrart, in the form of a compilation of engravings of the family's gallery of statuary, most notably the Athena Giustiniani, and the Giustiniani Hestia. Giustiniani followed interests in many other fields, writing essays in architecture, music, and art, as well as on such practical matters as hunting, travel, and horse trading. A friend and neighbour of Caravaggio's first patron, cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, he extended his own friendship to the artist, purchasing Saint Matthew and the Angel when it was rejected by church officials for its perceived lack of decorum. He died in Rome in 1637.     The collection itself was broken up at the beginning of the 19th century, when the king of Prussia acquired over 160 paintings, the most important of which were destined for museums in Berlin. Today the Berlin Gemäldegalerie houses 43 paintings from the Giustinani collection, while other works are to be found in Potsdam's Neues Palais and Bildergalerie Sanssouci. Further examples can be seen in the National Gallery, London, the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg and the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. More paintings from the collection have been traced to collections and museums in Europe and the United States.   "

It was produced in Ghent and Bruges ca 1515-1520 and by 1520 owned, though possibly not originally commissioned, by Cardinal Domenico Grimani. Several leading artists, including Simon Bening, the Master of James IV of Scotland and Gerard David, contributed some of their finest work to it.    All the main Venetian theatres were owned by important patrician families; combining business with pleasure in the Italian, if not European, city with the most crowded and competitive theatrical culture.  When most opera in Europe was still being put on by courts, ""economic prospects and a desire for exhibitionistic display"", as well a decline in their traditional overseas trading, attracted the best Venetian families to invest in the theatre during the 17th century.The Grimani were dominant, owning what is now called the Teatro Malibran, then called the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as well as the San Benedetto theatre, and other houses.  The Veniers owned La Fenice, still the main opera house.  The Vendramin owned the important Teatro di San Luca or Teatro Vendramin, founded in 1622, later renamed the Teatro Apollo, and since 1875 called the Teatro Goldoni, which still thrives as the city's main theatre for plays, now in a building of the 1720s.  In the age of Carlo Goldoni, the greatest Venetian dramatist, only the San Luca and the Malibran still put on spoken drama, and his desertion of the Grimani for the Vendramins at San Luca in 1752 was a major event in the theatrical history of the period, ushering in perhaps his finest period, in which as well as his comedies, he played a significant role in the development of the opera buffa. The Vendramins, who had considerable direct involvement in the management of the theatre, had a sometimes uneasy relationship with him, arguing over money and the style of his plays, until he left for Paris in 1761, as a result of a dispute with his rival, Carlo Gozzi.  However the Vendramin did not take their involvement as far as Vincenzo Grimani, who was a cardinal and opera librettist.   "

He is best remembered for having supplied the libretto for George Frideric Handel's early operatic success Agrippina, although he also supplied libretti for Elmiro re di Corinto, by Carlo Pallavicino, and Orazio  by G. F. Tosi. All the operas were produced at the Teatro S Giovanni Grisostomo, which he owned, while the remainder of his family owned several other Venetian opera houses. Politically he was allied to the Habsburg cause, and this alliance and his importance diplomatically to the Habsburgs led to him being made a cardinal in 1697. In 1708, he further received the honour of viceroyalty at Naples, where he died. His libretti are markedly different from the later moralizing tone of Metastasio and Apostolo Zeno, whose ideas came to dictate opera seria. His libretto for Agrippina is marked out by its amorality and the domination of aria over recitative. His portrayal of the Emperor Claudius has been perceived as an oblique attack on the character of Pope Clement XI. Grimani frequently clashed with Clement in the course of protecting the interests of the Habsburgs at the Vatican.   "

"Florence Sanudo or Fiorenza (died 1371), was Duchess of the Archipelago in 1362–1371, in co-regency with her second spouse. [SEP]     Florence Sanudo was the daughter and successor of John I, Duke of the Archipelago.She first married Giovanni dalle Carceri, Lord of Euboea (d. 1358). She succeeded her father in 1362 as a young widow with only one son, and attracted many suitors, for which reason W. Miller labelled her ""the Penelope of Frankish Greece"". Her marriage was politically very crucial and the subject of much diplomatic activity.  She was given a proposal from the Vignoso, Genoese Lord of Chios. This marriage was vetoed by the Republic of Venice, who regarded it of the utmost importance that she married a Venetian so as to prevent any potential anti-Venetian establishment in the Duchy. Florence was openly warned by Venice not to bestow her hand to any enemy of Venice, when there were so many Venetian consorts available.  Her mother assured the Venetians that her daughter had not desire to marry an enemy of Venice. Soon, however, Florence was given a proposal by Nerio I Acciajuoli, the future Duke of Athens and showed herself willing to accept it. Venice protested, but the groom was supported by the Kingdom of Naples through Robert of Taranto, who, as Prince of Achaia, was the suzerain of Athens. Naples warned Venice from interfering in the marriage, but Venice replied that Florence was a daughter of the republic and that her duchy owed its existence to the diplomacy and fleet of Venice, and ordered its fleet in Greece to prevent the marriage and the landing of Nerio in the Cyclades.Duchess Florence was kidnapped and brought via a Venetian galley to Venetian Crete. There, she was treated with respect due to her rank but informed that she would never be allowed to leave unless she agreed to marry the Venetian candidate, her cousin Nicholas Spezzabanda. Reportedly, she was not displeased with the person of Nicholas, who was described as attractive, but whatever the reason, she did consent to marry him, and the wedding took place in 1364.  The Venetians entitled her spouse eight Consort Duke, and Nicholas II were described as an able co-regent and loyal to Venice.  Florence died in 1371 and was succeeded by her son by Giovanni, Nicholas III dalle Carceri, under the regency of his stepfather during his minority.

"Maria Sanudo (died 1426) was lady of the island of Andros in the Duchy of the Archipelago in 1372-1383, and lady of the island of Paros and of one third of Negroponte in 1383-1426 in co-regency with her spouse, Gaspare Sommaripa. [SEP]    Maria Sanudo was a daughter of the Duchess of the Archipelago Florence Sanudo and her second husband Nicholas II Sanudo, and half-sister of Nicholas III dalle Carceri (r. 1371–1383), the last Duke of the Archipelago from the House of Sanudo.    After Florence Sanudo died, she was succeeded by her son Nicholas III. As he was still a minor, the regency was exercised for a time by Nicholas Sanudo. In December 1371, Maria received from her half brother (in reality from her own father in his capacity as regent) the island of Andros, the second largest island of the duchy after Naxos, as a fief. The grant stipulated that as feudatories of the Duke, Maria and her heirs were obliged to render personal military service for a three-month period each year, as well as send twenty marines for the ducal galleys for two months every year. Maria was also obliged to not marry without her half-brother's permission, as well as to look after her younger sister Lisia, and find her a suitable husband. In reality, as Maria too was under-age, the oath of fealty and the ceremony of investiture were probably undertaken by Nicholas Sanudo, who also exercised the governance of the island until his daughter's coming of age, as he is mentioned in contemporary documents as dominus insule Andre. In 1372, Maria also received a grant of the small island of Antiparos and the domain of Lichada on Euboea.Nicholas III, probably again under the influence of his stepfather, later changed the terms of the grant from a feo to a censo, replacing the owed military service with an annual rent. Soon after coming of age himself and dispensing with his stepfather's regency, however, he tried to renege on the change. Nicholas Sanudo turned to the Republic of Venice, which in August 1373 ordered Nicholas III to redress the issue. At about the same time, the issue of Maria's marriage came to the fore following the failure of negotiations for her marriage to the son of Boniface Fadrique, lord of Salona, Lidoriki and Aigina. As had been the case for her mother, due to her possessions in Euboea, the affair was of great concern to Venice: the local Venetian bailo of Negroponte, Bartolomeo Querini, suggested a marriage to his son Zanino. Nicholas Sanudo went to meet the bailo at Negroponte and agreed, in exchange for assistance in the matter of his daughter's domains. The deal was kept a secret, and the unsuspecting Nicholas III gave his consent. Maria and her father travelled to Negroponte, but in the event the marriage fell through, for almost at the last minute, Nicholas III fell out with the bailo, perhaps suspecting his designs, and revoked his permission.In 1376, there was yet another marriage attempt, this time with George III Ghisi; the match had the approval of Venice and received a papal dispensation—Maria and George were third cousins—but in the event the wedding never took place.    Nicholas III was murdered in 1383 by Francesco I Crispo (r. 1383–1397), who became the new duke. The new ruler promised to ""treat as his own child"" Maria, but she continued to challenge his right to rule. Seeking to cement his position and gain recognition from the Venetian bailo at Negroponte, Crispo arranged a marriage between his daughter and Pietro Zeno, the son of the bailo. As his daughter's dowry, he gave the islands of Syros and Andros, which he took from Maria. As a compensation, she was given the island of Paros in 1389, on condition that she marry the Veronese Gaspare Sommaripa.Paros (and Antiparos) were a not inconsiderable fief: the islands were valuable, and each furnished thirty sailors to the ducal galleys. Nevertheless, the marriage was a calculated political ploy by Crispo: Sommaripa may have been connected to his fellow Veronese dalle Carceri, but held no feudal rank or titles, and the new duke intended to neutralize Maria by marrying her to this politically insignificant parvenu. Through the intervention of Venice, Maria also succeeded her half-brother as lady of one third of the island of Euboea. From her marriage with Gaspare Sommaripa, Maria had Crusino I Sommaripa, and Fiorenza Sommaripa, wife of Duke Giacomo I Crispo (r. 1397–1418). Throughout her life, Maria did not abandon her claims to Andros, and after half a century of legal disputes, in 1440 her son Crusino was able to regain possession of it. Giacomo I was succeeded by his brother, John II Crispo (r. 1418–1433), who, in the words of William Miller, ""acted with a complete lack of chivalry towards his sister-in-law and her mother, Maria Sanudo, reducing them to penury and exile by depriving them of their islands"" until 1421, conceding only after repeated remonstrations by the Venetian authorities, backed by the threat of force.Maria Sanudo died in 1426.

"The Sceriman family, also referred to as the Shahremanian, Shahremanean, Shahrimanian, Shehrimanian, Shariman, or Seriman family, were a wealthy Safavid merchant family of Armenian ethnicity. [SEP] A Catholic family, they had their roots in early 17th-century New Julfa (the Armenian quarter of Isfahan, Iran), and relatively quickly came to preside over branches all over the world, stretching from Italy (mostly Venice) in the west, to Pegu (Burma) in the east. Apart from being renowned as a trader's family, some Scerimans were high-ranking individuals in the Safavid state, including in its military, religious, and bureaucratic systems. Later, similar positions were obtained abroad, such as in the various Italian city-states and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. They especially became renowned in the Republic of Venice, where they were well integrated into its ruling class. Nevertheless, until their decline in the late 1790s and eventual inactivity in the 19th century, they remained bound to their original base in Iran. Despite their success, the Scerimans helped create a rift in the Armenian community of Iran. Due to their prominent position in society, their support of the Catholic faith created a strong sense of hostility between the majority Gregorian Armenians and minority Catholic Armenians.        The ancestors of the Scerimans were from the Armenian-populated territories of the Safavid Empire, specifically from the town of Jugha (""Old Julfa""), and were amongst those that were deported during Shah Abbas I's (r. 1588–1629) mass relocation of his empire's ethnic Armenian inhabitants in 1604. Historian Sebouh Aslanian says that some Armenian sources from the post-deportation period claim a noble status for the family, stating that the family belonged to an ancient clan of nobles (nakharars), with possible roots in the historical Armenian city of Ani. After they were settled in the early 17th century in the new Armenian quarter of New Julfa within the boundaries of the city of Isfahan in central Iran, they started to be a pivotal factor in the internal and external commerce of the Safavid Empire. They accomplished this by making extensive use of their contacts both inside and outside the Safavid realm.The Scerimans were reputedly both the most influential and the richest amongst all Catholic Armenian families in New Julfa. The first patriarch of the family, Agha Morad, was from Jugha. Nothing is known about his life in Old Julfa, or about his career in New Julfa. One of his sons, Shahriman, carried on the line. The family is named after him. It was in the mid-17th century under Shahriman's son, Khvajeh Sarhat, that the family's wealth, prestige, and influence grew. Unlike other Armenian merchants from Julfa, the Scerimans by origin and specialisation focused primarily on diamonds and gems, whereas most other Armenians from Julfa specialized in the silk trade with Europe. As a family firm, the Scerimans followed the principle of the oldest man being in charge of the business and ventures, as well as having ""patriarchial and managerial authority"" over his siblings and their own families. In 1646, Sarhat, who functioned as the main patriarch of the family, abjured from the Armenian Apostolic Church (i.e. Gregorianism) and converted to Catholicism. Other members would formally follow later. Over the years, the Scerimans played an important role in the creation of a rift in the Armenian community of Iran. Due to their prominent position in society, they, as heralds of the Catholic faith, created a strong sense of hostility between the majority Gregorian Armenians and minority Catholic Armenians.    The eldest son of Sarhat, Zachariah, functioned as a royal merchant on behalf of Shah Suleiman I (r. 1666–1694) and grand vizier Shaykh Ali Khan Zanganeh (1669–1689). Zachariah played a pivotal role in the ratification of Tsar Alexis's (r. 1645–1676) decree which granted merchants from New Julfa special trade privileges for using the Russian route for the Safavid silk export to Europe. In the same period, the Scerimans started to search for ways to expand their influence. As early as 1613, the Scerimans owned property (a house) in Venice. They used it for their family members and agents whenever needed. After the 1650s, other sons of Sarhat increased the family's holdings in Italy. In the 1650s and 1660s, Sarhat's fourth son, Gaspar, spent long periods of time in various Italian cities, including Venice, Livorno, and Rome. In the 1690s, Nazar and Shahriman, sons of Morad di Sceriman, invested roughly 720,000 ducats into various banks in Venice. The deed was done by establishing numerous ""interest-bearing accounts"" and by offering ""substantial"" loans to the Venetian Republic, which needed them for its wars against the Ottoman Empire. These investments would yield a significant profit later on. At about the same time, a certain ""cultural component"" is noted as well in the Scerimans' fixation on the Italian city-states.In 1684, an additional eleven members of the family in New Julfa converted to Catholicism. Following this, the Scerimans became heralds of the Catholic faith in New Julfa, and were known as ""great supporters"" of the Vatican. Conversion was certainly not without interests; as the Vatican profited from the Scerimans in the course of the 1680s (with the family still stationed in New Julfa), a papal bull was issued in 1696 which granted the Scerimans full Roman citizenship and trade-related privileges in numerous Italian cities, including Rome. Shortly after 1684, then grand vizier Shaykh Ali Khan Zanganeh employed a son of Zachariah as his own private merchant. In 1691, a chapel that had been built by the Jesuits in Isfahan in 1662 was enlarged with financial assistance from the Sceriman family.     Further success came with the turn of the 18th century. In 1699, on the recommendation of the Papacy, Leopold I (r. 1658–1705), then ruler of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, granted the Scerimans titles of Counts in Hungary. In the same year, based on a report sent to the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) in Rome, it was evident that the Scerimans had some 50 servants and up to a 100 agents in the royal capital of Isfahan alone. Around the same time, as a result of the loan given several years earlier, the Scerimans were given numerous privileges by the Senate of the Republic of Venice. A climactic point was reached in the mid-18th century, as members of the family were raised to the class of nobility in numerous Italian city-states. Even though their efforts to join the Venetian Patriciate, which they had started in the early 18th century, did not succeed, they were well integrated in the ruling class of the Venetian Republic via marriage alliances with several noble Venetian families. Their prestige as foreigners in the Venetian state was also increased by being well-integrated into the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. For example, Basilio, son of Gaspar Sceriman, was, according to D. Maxwell White, given the position of a monsignor and later even became governor of several administrative regions. Another family member, Domenico Sceriman, became a bishop after being elected. Around that time, family member David Sceriman was likely the richest Armenian in Livorno. In the 1760s, another Sceriman in Venice, Zaccaria di Sceriman (whose mother was a Venetian noblewoman), would become a renowned writer and satirist.    The Sceriman headquarters continued to function until the late 1790s in Venice and Livorno. Subsequently, their business fortunes diminished. In the first few years after moving the headquarters to Venice, the office was often in contact with its branch in New Julfa, as the latter was an integral part of the family's ventures.Even though the Scerimans enjoyed success abroad, it came at a costly price. Their close alignment with the Catholics had alienated the family from the Armenian Church hierarchy at New Julfa. Catholic Armenians were considered outsiders by Gregorian Armenians, and were dubbed Frangs (i.e. ""Franks""). Continued spending on matters related to the Catholic faith raised doubts among Safavid officials about the loyalty of the Armenian Catholics in the empire. At the same time, the Gregorian Armenians lobbied inside and outside the court to incite measures against the Catholic Armenians. In 1694, when anti-Catholic sentiments in New Julfa were at a high point, fueled by Shah Sultan Husayn (r. 1694–1722), the family received most of the impact. In 1698, burdened by fellow Armenians and increasing taxes, Khvajeh Gaspar and his family decided to settle in Venice. His older brother, Khvajeh Marcara, followed shortly after with his family. Nevertheless, the Scerimans maintained a continuous presence in their ancestral New Julfa, as other Sceriman branches continued to live there. The headquarters, however, were moved to Venice and Livorno, where several Sceriman members had settled.Even though the Scerimans are mostly known for their tight relations with the Safavids and later the Italian city-states and Austro-Hungary, they were also represented (especially through junior members), when needed, in Russia, India, the Netherlands, Burma, Spain, and Malacca.Sibouh Aslanian cites two reasons why maintaining the Julfa branch following the relocation was of extreme importance to the family. The first reason was that, traditionally, the most lucrative capital-generating markets for the family were in Southeastern Asia and India. Hence, a well-located regional office in New Julfa was pivotal in connecting the Mediterranean ventures of the family with those of the gem market around the Indian Ocean. The second reason was that, even though the Scerimans were eager to integrate and assimilate in Italy, they still were Julfan Armenians by origin, ""at least as far as their trading habits were concerned"". The Scerimans were a calculating and strategizing group of individuals, who not only thought about their future enterprises, but were equally concerned about their situation in foreign lands. Even though they travelled far and wide, they remained bound to their original home in New Julfa through ""language, personal relationships, or otherwise"".

"The Palazzo Contarini-Sceriman, also called Palazzo Seriman ai Gesuiti is a 14th-century palace in the Sestiere of Cannaregio of Venice, Italy. [SEP] It is located near the church of the Gesuiti.    The palace was erected first by the Dolce family in the 14th-century but by the next century belonged to the Contarini family. In 1628 Contarina Contarini, married to Piero Priuli, sold the palace to Alberto Gozzi, a silk merchant. Gozzi would gain access to the aristocracy in 1646, after helping fund the expensive but unsuccessful defense during the Siege of Candia. Gozzi's patronage had also helped erect the Camalodolese convent in San Clemente near Murano, and funded an altar in the church of San Moise. It was near this palace and the nearby bridge around 1675, that the aristocrat Leonardo Loredan, descendant of a Doge, was found dead in a boat. The unexplained death was the source of many rumors, claiming accidental death, murder by relatives, or murder by the Inquisitors of the Republic. The palace, had housed for a time the Accademia degli Industriosi, a salon of literature and debate, until it moved to the academy of industrious, before conveyed in Cà Morosini in San Canciano. In 1698 another Alberto Gozzi, descendant of the Gozzi above, endowed the property to the four charitably hospitals in the City, the  Incurabili, Pietà, Mendicanti, and the Ospedaletto, in addition to the Monastery of the Convertite. His wife Adriana Dona was allowed to remain in the palace till 1725. The next year, the palace was then auctioned and purchased by Stefano Sceriman. The Sceriman family was originally an Armenian merchant family from Isfahan. Stefano had been awarded Roman citizenship by Pope Innocent XII, and named Count of Hungary by Emperor Leopold I. The family had gained importance in Venice during the 17th century. In 1850, Giovanni Battista Sceriman willed the Palace to the Institute Manin. In 1884, it became home of the Casa generalizia dell'Istituto delle Ancelle di Gesù Bambino.The palace has undergone a number of reconstructions leading to an eclectic combination of various styles, including Venetian Gothic. Another facade on Rio dei Sartori has similar windows. The main entrance stairwell was painted with the Apotheosis of the Sceriman Family by the school of Tiepolo.   "

Ferrari and company stayed until 1639 when the business was acquired by a new company managed by entrepreneur Francesco Caletti-Bruni, with financial backing from Venetian nobleman Cavalli. Caletti-Bruni composed most of the operas performed here in the six years from 1639 to 1645. After the 1650s the theater was surpassed by others, and its number of performances declined. Impresario Marco Faustini managed the Teatro San Cassiano from 1657 to 1660. Towards the end of the 17th century, Venice became the opera capital of the world as another ten opera houses had opened. At this point the Teatro San Cassiano could count first performances of 37 operas. The last performances were held in 1807 and it was demolished in 1812, mainly due to recurring fires. The operatic period dramma in musica coincided with the early years of the commercial San Cassiano and was influenced by its composers.

"The Tron were a noble family of Venice whose most prominent member, Nicolò Tron, served as the Doge of Venice from 1471 to 1473.

The family rose to particular prominence in the 15th century as maritime traders and local rulers in Corfu and Crete. The line had allegedly become extinct by the 19th century.The Tron family moved to France, where it thrived and grew in Buchony. At some point, the family divided and a part relocated to the valley of Ubaye and the city of Barcelonnette. By the early 20th century, parts of both branches of the family moved to México, where it remains and grows to this day, mainly in México City and Morelia, Michoacán.   The family's origins are unclear, although 18th-century genealogists, including Marco Barbaro in his Albori de' patritii veneti have proposed that they originally came from Ancona. They are thought to have built the now demolished Chiesa di San Boldo in Venice in the 11th century, and there are records in Venice of a Marco ""Truno"" dating from 1159. The family had three branches: San Stae (from the Venetian parish of San Stae), San Beneto (from the Venetian parish of San Beneto), and Candia (from the Kingdom of Candia, the name of Crete when it was a colony of the Venetian Republic).

"The Zorzi or Giorgi was a family of Venetian origin.

Under Nicholas I they took control of Bodonitsa in 1335. Nicholas was succeeded by Francis, who governed the margraviate for almost forty years. In 1414, Nicholas II was defeated and the Turks took control of Bodonitsa, nonetheless Nicholas III continued to employ the title and garner the prestige that came with it. He married his daughter Chiara to the duke of Athens, Nerio II. She was to govern the duchy on behalf of her young son Francesco I.   "

[SEP]    She was the daughter of Nicholas III Zorzi, the titular margrave of Bodonitsa, and renowned for her beauty. After Nerio's death, she secured her right to act as guardian of her son and thereby regent of the Duchy and had the Ottomans consent to it. Not long after she came to power, she fell in love with the Venetian Bartolomeo Contarini, who visited Athens, and asked him to propose to her.  He explained that he was already married, but to make himself able to marry Chiara, he returned to Venice, and murdered his wife, after which he returned to Athens and married the regent, in 1453. As her spouse, he also took a share in her government.The Athenians were not happy about the Venetian influence, and complaints reached the Ottoman Sultan. Evidently, the citizenry mistrusted the two lovers' influence over the young duke, for whose safety they may have feared. Mehmet II of the Ottoman Empire intervened at the insistence of the people on the behalf of the young duke Francis, and summoned Bartolomeo and his stepson the duke to his court at Adrianople. Duke Francesco I was never heard of again.Another Acciaioli, the young duke's cousin Francesco II, was sent to Athens as a Turkish client duke and Chiara thus deprived of her power in the city. The new duke had Chiara murdered at Megara. According to legend, the murder took place in the monastery of Daphni, the mausoleum of the French dukes, where he cut off her head himself while she knelt invoking the aid of the Holy Virgin, but this is a fictionalized version from a folk lore of the murder.

"Francis Zorzi (or Giorgi) (Italian: Francesco) (1337–1388), called Marchesotto, was a member of the Venetian Zorzi family and the Marquess of Bodonitsa in Central Greece from 1345 to his death.

His parents were embroiled in a dispute when Nicholas died in 1354 and Guglielma raised Francis to co-rule with her. The Republic of Venice was pleased that one of its own was again ruling Bodonitsa and happily negotiated for Francis and his mother with the Catalan Duchy of Athens. Francis was a vassal of the Duke of Athens, to whom he was obligated to send an annual of tribute of four armed horses. Francis tried to maintain his independence from the Catalan vicar general of Athens and resisted the attempts of Peter IV of Aragon to establish his authority in Greece. He also supported Maria of Sicily against Peter for the Trinacrian throne. Indeed, through inheritance and ""mercantile venture"" he had obtained ""a very fine estate"" and great wealth, being the most important of Mary's princely supporters. Francis even made overtures to the Navarrese mercenaries of Juan de Urtubia before his death, perhaps encouraging their sack of Thebes. He took part in the Council of Thebes on 1 October 1373. He died around 1388 and was succeeded by his eldest son Jacob under the regency of his widow Euphrosyne Sommaripa of the Cyclades. He had a daughter whom he married to a Serbian lord in Thessaly (the Serbs had established themselves there under Dušan), Stephen, a son of Simeon Uroš.   "
"Jacob Zorzi (also Giacomo Giorgi) was the Marquess of Bodonitsa from 1388 to 1410. [SEP] He was the last true ruler of Bodonitsa. Jacob was the eldest son of Francis Zorzi, of Venetian origin, and Euphrosyne Sommaripa, of the Cyclades. He succeeded his father around 1388 on the latter's death and under the regency of his mother. Soon before his death, Francis had ceased to pay annual tribute to the Duchy of Athens, though he remained a peer of the Principality of Achaea. In 1393–1394, however, the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I invaded northern Greece and conquered the County of Salona, another Crusader state dating back to the Fourth Crusade. Lamia and Neopatria were captured and Pharsala and Domokos were abandoned by the Serbs, whose leader was Jacob's brother-in-law. For whatever reason, Bodonitsa was spared and merely forced to pay annual tribute to the sultan. In 1403, 1408, and 1409, he was party to the treaties between Venice and the Ottoman prince Süleyman Çelebi and in the first of these succeeded in ridding himself of his obligations of payment of tribute. By a treaty of 1405 between Venice and Antonio I Acciaioli of Athens, he was included to secure his southern border and relieve him of worry there. He moved many peasants and livestock to Karystos, the Euboean stronghold of his brother Nicholas, in an attempt to protect them from Turkish assaults, but he was content enough himself to remain in Bodonitsa and even bid for Tenos and Mykonos, two islands which Venice was auctioning off in 1406. His bid failed. Süleyman Çelebi died in 1410 and his successor, Musa Çelebi, renewed the war on Bodonitsa almost immediately. In early spring, Bodonitsa was besieged, and Jacob resisted, for he ""preferred, like the high-minded and true Christian that he was, to die rather than surrender the place."" Nevertheless, he was killed by traitors while ""bravely defending the medieval Thermopylae against the new Persian invasion.""

"The Barnabotti were a class of impoverished nobility found in the Venetian Republic towards the end of the Republican period. [SEP]  The term Barnabotti derives form the fact that the group met and lived in the zone of the Campo San Barnaba. The presence of these nobles in this area is attested by toponyms such Casìn dei Nobili, used to describe certain gambling houses.  The area of Campo San Barnaba, being distant from the city centre, attracted lower rents. The term Barnabotti refers to those patricians who, although having lost much of their fortune, continued by law to maintain their seat in the Great Council of Venice, the assembly that governed the Venetian city and state. Although they maintained a position of political influence, due to their impoverishment the Barnabotti as a group were frequently involved in disputes with the rest of the nobility.  Their lack of means, however, meant that they were susceptible to vote buying. Barnabotti were barred from commercial trades, and were therefore given a small allowance from the state. During the 17th century, efforts were made to improve the welfare of the Barnabotti, by establishing a school in 1617 for the special education of children, the Accademia della Giudecca. However, the number of poor nobles increased with the loss of the island of Crete and the migration of its nobles to the city of Venice.After the plague of 1630-1631, the number of nobles began to fall dramatically. An insider commented late in the 17th century that there were only fourteen or fifteen men capable of serving as Savio Grande. The need for recruiting noblemen was used to justify granting membership in the Great Council to rich patrons. Between 1645 and 1718, nobility was conferred on 127 persons, each of whom paid 100,000 ducats and were personally recommended by the Collegio. This, however, failed to reduce falling numbers. Membership fell from around 2,500 members in the mid-16th century, to 1,660 after the plague, and in 1775 membership was down to 1,300 members. Among adult Venetian males in 1520, about 6.4 percent were noblemen. By 1797, this number was down to 3.2 percent.   "
"Filocalo Navigajoso (died 1214) was a Venetian (or possibly of mixed Greek and Venetian descent) nobleman and first Latin ruler of the island of Lemnos (known as Stalimene in Italian) in Greece.

"Antonino Barges (fl. 1546–1565) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance, active in Venice and Treviso. [SEP]  While known as a composer of light popular secular forms such as the villotta, he also wrote motets and a Requiem.  He was a friend and probably a student of Adrian Willaert, the founder of the Venetian School, and was listed as a witness to Willaert's last will and testament.Little is known about his early life.  He was born in Barges.  Like many of his countrymen, he received a good musical education in the Low Countries, and either in youth or early adulthood came to Italy, where employment prospects for singers and composers were better than at home.  By 1550 he had become maestro di cappella (choirmaster) at the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (known as the Ca' Grande) in Venice, a prestigious post.  He left Venice in 1555, going to Treviso, where he became a Franciscan and joined the convent of San Francesco.  Further records show that he was employed at Treviso Cathedral between 1562 and 1565 as maestro di cappella.  No further records of his life have yet been found, and he has not yet been the subject of a dedicated scholarly biography. Barges venerated his teacher and friend Willaert, and mentioned him glowingly in the dedication to his first book of villotte (Di Antonino Barges maestro di cappella alla Casa grande di Venetia il primo libro de villotte a quatro voci con un'altra canzon della galina novamente da lui composte & date in luce, Venice: Gardano, 1550):  ""l'unico inventore della vera e buona musica"" (""the sole inventor of music which is true and good."") Indeed, friendship is a theme of the dedication: in addition to the reference to Willaert, Barges characterizes his relationship with Girolamo Fenaruolo, the dedicatee, as a friendship, and mentions their mutual friends Stefano Taberio and Marco Silvio. If Barges's dedication is to be believed, these men were among the first to hear and sing his songs, but the songs might also have found a home in Domenico Venier's salon.Barges published only this one book of light secular music, although it contains music besides villottas such as a dozen villanescas and four madrigals not by Barges but by Andrea Patricio (composers at this time often admitted a few works by others into their publications).  Other music by Barges included some sacred works, including two motets for four voices, published in 1563, an Alleluia, and a Requiem for four voices (not dated).  It is not known if he wrote this for Willaert.  The style of the secular music is as light as anything found in northern Italy at the time:  dancelike, quick, often triple meter, and often with nonsense syllables in a ""patter"" style.Barges also wrote three instrumental ricercars.

"Giovanni Bassano (c. 1561 – 3 September 1617) was an Italian composer associated with the Venetian School of composers and a cornettist of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. [SEP] He was a key figure in the development of the instrumental ensemble at the basilica of San Marco di Venezia (St. Mark). His detailed book on instrumental ornamentation has survived. It is a rich resource for research in contemporary performance practice. Bassano was most responsible for the performance of the music of Giovanni Gabrieli, who would emerge as one of the most renowned members of the Venetian School.    Giovanni was likely born in Venice around 1560 or 1561 in the parish of San Maurizio, the son of Santo Griti da Sebenico and Orsetta Bassano. Orsetta's father Jacomo Bassano was the only brother of the six sons of Jeronimo Bassano who did not move permanently to London from Venice around 1540 as part of a new recorder consort to King Henry VIII. Santo seems to have taken over his father-in-law's instrument-making business and adopted the surname of Bassano for himself. He was the probable inventor of bassanelli.Giovanni Bassano arrived as a young instrumental player at St. Mark's probably in 1576 at the age of 18. He quickly acquired a reputation as one of the finest instrumentalists in Venice. By 1585 he had published his first book, Ricercate, passagi et cadentie, which details how best to ornament passages when transcribing vocal music for instruments. In that same year he became a music teacher at the seminary associated with St. Mark's. In 1601, he took over the job from Girolamo Dalla Casa as head of the instrumental ensemble. He served in this post until his death in August 1617.In addition to directing the music at St. Mark's, Bassano directed several groups of piffari, bands of wind players including bagpipes, recorders, shawms, flageolets, bassoons, and conceivably other instruments, which were used in other churches (such as San Rocco) or street festivals.Bassano was also a composer, though his music has been overshadowed by his renown as a performer and his associated performance treatise. He wrote motets and concerti ecclesiastici (sacred concertos) in the Venetian polychoral style; and he also wrote madrigals, canzonettas and some purely instrumental music. His canzonettas achieved some fame outside Italy: Thomas Morley knew them, printing them in London in 1597 in English translation.Some of Bassano's instrumental music is ingeniously contrapuntal, as though he were indulging a side of his personality that he was unable to display in his more ceremonial, homophonic compositions. His fantasias and ricercars are densely imitative and contain retrograde and retrograde inversions of motivic ideas, a rarity in counterpoint before the 20th century.The similarity of Bassano's motets to the early work of Heinrich Schütz, who studied in Venice with Gabrieli, suggests that the two may have known each other. Likely Schütz knew Bassano's music and was influenced by it.      "
"Vincenzo Bellavere (also Bell'haver, Bell'aver, Belaver) (c.1540-1541 – 29 August 1587) was an Italian composer of the Venetian School. [SEP] While a fairly minor figure in the Venetian School, he was a competent composer of madrigals and wrote a few works in the grand Venetian polychoral style.    Nothing is known about him prior to his appearance in Padua in 1567 as an organist at Crosieri Cathedral. That same year he tried to gain the prestigious job as first organist of the cathedral there. In 1568 he acquired the position of primary organist at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, a Venetian establishment almost as prestigious as St. Mark's; he held this post until 1584 at which time he returned to Padua to take the post at the cathedral that he at first failed to win. In December 1585 he was fired from his job in Padua, probably because of an unexcused absence, but he returned to Venice to become organist of yet another Venetian church, Santo Stefano. In 1586 he became first organist at St. Mark's, the position just vacated by Andrea Gabrieli; thus he was first organist alongside Giovanni Gabrieli, who was second organist.  Unfortunately Bellavere died after only holding this post for nine months. Bellavere was a talented composer and could have become a major member of the Venetian school, had his career not been cut short; possibly he died fairly young, though reliable information on his age is missing.

"Perissone Cambio (c.1520 – c.1562) was a Franco-Flemish composer and singer of the Renaissance, active in Venice. [SEP]  He was one of the most prominent students and colleagues of Adrian Willaert during the formative years of the Venetian School, and published several books of madrigals in the 1540s.     Nothing is known about his early life except that he was either from Flanders or the immediately adjacent French-speaking areas.  Two competing mentions of his origin exist in the historical record, one naming him as French and one as Flemish, with the Flemish mention coming from the Venetian Senate; the latter is considered more reliable.  By the early 1540s he had come from his homeland to Venice, probably to study with Willaert, who was renowned as a teacher.  This was near the end of the period during which musicians who received their early training in the Netherlands and adjacent areas left their homelands, going to Italy and other locations where demand for composers and singers was greatest.  Perissone became one of Willaert's students, and part of a close group which included Girolamo Parabosco, Baldassare Donato, Jacques Buus, Jacques Du Pont, and Cipriano de Rore; in addition he acquired a reputation as an excellent singer, most likely of high vocal parts.During the late 1540s he was the most prolific composer of the group around Willaert, publishing a total of four separate collections of secular music.  In 1548 he finally became a member of the chapel of San Marco di Venezia, on an unpaid basis, which was an extraordinary event; presumably this occurred because his singing was highly desired, but there were no formal job openings.  The doge of Venice, Francesco Donà, intervened on his behalf and made him a paid member of the chapel shortly thereafter.While Perissone's last solo publication was in 1550, he continued as a singer at San Marco and presumably a composer throughout the decade.  He also sang in the Compagnia di San Marco, a group of musicians associated with San Marco who performed in other locations in Venice.  In 1557 he joined the brotherhood of the Scuola di San Marco.  Nothing specific is known about his further career, and he is believed to have died around 1562; after his death, poet Domenico Veniero wrote a sonnet indicating that he had died young, but the date is not known.    Perissone was one of the followers of Willaert in the early time of development of the Italian madrigal, the period referred to by Alfred Einstein as the ""madrigal's age of innocence"".  Even though he was a personal friend, he was not significantly influenced by fellow Willaert student Cipriano de Rore, the principal figure in madrigal composition in the 1550s, and whose style marked an extraordinary increase in expressive intensity of the secular vocal form.In all, Perissone published four books of secular music by himself:  a book of villanellas for four voices in 1545, a book of madrigals for four voices in 1547, and two books of madrigals for five voices, in 1545 and 1550.  Some other individual madrigals appear in collections by others, particularly Cipriano de Rore, and Perissone wrote a dedicatory letter for one of Rore's books, but only in the alto part-book (Perissone was probably an alto).  If he wrote any sacred music aside from a single five-voice motet setting of Ad Te, Domine (1549), it has not survived.  While most of the composers who worked at San Marco in the 16th century left a substantial body of sacred music, Perissone was one of the few who did not.Perissone was a versatile stylist, and wrote both light and serious madrigals, with a texture varying from the smooth polyphony of the Netherlanders to bright, largely chordal textures.  Sometimes he anticipated harmonic developments of the 17th century, such as when he used the bass voice as a harmonic support rather than as an equal participant in the motivic interplay of a composition.  He was also fond of false relations, as in his setting of Gottifredi's Deh, perchè com'è il vostro al nome mio, a madrigal which also contains deliberately mis-accented text setting, a characteristic which distinguishes him from his teacher Willaert, who was more inclined to follow Pietro Bembo's strict advice on text setting.

"Ippolito Ciera (fl. 1546–1561) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance, active at Treviso and Venice. [SEP] Little is yet known about his life, for neither his biography nor his works have yet been the subject of a scholarly study.  He was a Dominican friar and sang at Treviso Cathedral: the earliest documentary record of his life is a payment in 1546 for his salary there. In addition to singing, he taught music to the novices at the convent of San Nicolò. By 1561, he had become maestro di cappella, the choirmaster, at the church of San Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, a much more prestigious position, and incidentally in one of the musical centers of Europe. He probably knew Adrian Willaert, the founder of the Venetian School, and may have studied with him, as did many of the musicians in Venice at that time; his veneration for the elder master is shown in a laudatory sonnet he wrote and set to music for him. It is No. 12 in his first book of madrigals.All of Ciera's known music is vocal. His complete surviving output amounts to a single setting of the mass, four motets, and two published collections of madrigals. Dates of the works range from 1554 to 1561, with the two books of madrigals – the first for four voices, and the second for five – published in 1554 and 1561, respectively. Ciera's style in his sacred music (the motets and mass) was akin to that of the Netherlanders, with dense pervading imitation. His madrigals, on the other hand, use chordal harmonies, and occasionally what was referred to as the ""note nere"" technique (""black note"" for ""filled in notes"" – i.e. quick note values, running passages, alternating with other textures).  Some of the madrigals are antiphonal in places, reminiscent of the polychoral style of the Venetian School.   "
"Girolamo Diruta (c. 1546 – 1624 or 1625) was an Italian organist, music theorist, and composer. [SEP]  He was famous as a teacher, for his treatise Il Transilvano (Venice, 1st part 1593; 2nd part 1609-10) on counterpoint, and for his part in the development of keyboard technique, particularly on the organ.  He was born in Deruta, near Perugia.    Diruta was born in Deruta in 1546 c.  He became a friar minor conventual in the convent Perugia in 1566; later, from 1569 to 1574, he was in the convent of Correggio. Around 1578 he moved to Venice, where he met Claudio Merulo, Gioseffo Zarlino and Costanzo Porta (who was also a friar minor conventual), and he probably studied with each of them.  Merulo mentioned Diruta in a prefatory letter to the Transilvano (1593), as one of his finest students.From 1580 until 1585 he was organist at the Gubbio cathedral. He returned in Venice at the Frari convent, where he was organist from 1586 until 1589. By 1593 he was organist at Chioggia cathedral. In these year he dedicated the first part of his treatise Il Transilvano to Sigismund Bathory, prince of Transylvania.  Later he returned to live in Umbria. He was again organist at the Gubbio cathedral from 1604 to 1610. In 1610 from Gubbio he dedicated the second part of his treatise Il Transilvano to Leonora Orsini Sforza, niece of Grand Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany. He died in Deruta in 1624 or 1625. His nephew Agostino Diruta (c. 1595 – c. 1647) was also a composer, and his pupil.   "
"Claudio Merulo (Italian pronunciation: [ˈklaudjo ˈmɛːrulo]; 8 April 1533 – 4 May 1604) was an Italian composer, publisher and organist of the late Renaissance period, most famous for his innovative keyboard music and his ensemble music composed in the Venetian polychoral style. [SEP]  He was born in Correggio and died in Parma. Born Claudio Merlotti, he Latinised his surname (meaning little blackbird) when he became famous in Venetian cultural clubs.    Little is known about his early life except that he studied in Correggio with Tuttovale Menon, a famous madrigalist who also worked in the Ferrara court; he also studied with Girolamo Donato, an organist. It is likely that he studied with Zarlino at St. Mark's in Venice.  While in Venice he became close friends with Costanzo Porta, a friendship which was to endure for his entire life. On 21 October 1556, he was appointed organist at Old Cathedral of Brescia (Duomo Vecchio), and his skill as an organist must have been impressive, because he became organist at St. Mark's, one of the most prestigious positions for an organist in Italy, in 1557; he was selected over a list of candidates that included Andrea Gabrieli.  This was the first important event of his career, and he was considered to be the finest organist in Italy. It is important to note that in St. Mark's there were two organs, and two separate organists were appointed to play them: in 1557 Merulo was appointed to the second, smaller organ, while Annibale Padovano remained at the post of first organist. After Padovano's hurried departure from Venice in 1566, Merulo was appointed to the first organ, and Andrea Gabrieli became the second organist. He was appointed as ambassador of Venetian Republic at the marriage of Franceso de’ Medici and Bianca Cappello in 1579 and wrote music of celebration for Henry III of France, who visited Venice in 1574. In 1584, he suddenly left this position in Venice. The reasons for this are unclear, and somewhat surprising; in Venice he was well-paid, and had a very good reputation; and St. Mark's was one of the most important places for an organist. However, in December 1584 his name appears in payment register of Farnesia Court of Parma. In 1587 he was appointed as organist in Parma Cathedral and from 1591 also in Church of Santa Maria della Steccata. While here, he requested improvements to the organ, carried out by Costanzo Antegnati, the last heir of the great Brescian family of organ makers.  We can deduce that Merulo used the Steccata's organ for his proofs of new composition, based on his Venetian experience, and continued to compose in this style. He lived in Parma until his death. During this period, he made several trips in Venice and Rome, where he published his famous two volume Toccate per organo. Merulo died in Parma on 4 May 1604 and was buried in Parma Cathedral near to the tomb of Cipriano de Rore.  He left a daughter and his wife Amabilia Banzola.    Merulo is famous for his keyboard music.  His Toccatas, in particular, are innovative; he was the first to contrast sections of contrapuntal writing with passageworks; often he inserts sections which could be called ricercars into pieces which otherwise are labelled toccatas or canzonas. (In the late 16th century, these terms are only approximately descriptive; different composers clearly had different ideas of what they meant).  Often his keyboard pieces begin as though they are to be a transcription of vocal polyphony, but then gradually add embellishment and elaboration until they reach a climactic passage of considerable virtuosity.  Sometimes, especially in his later music, he develops ornaments which acquire the status of a motif, which is then used developmentally; this anticipates a principal generative technique in the Baroque era.  Often Merulo casually ignores the ""rules"" of voice-leading, giving the music an expressive intensity more associated with the late school of madrigalists than with keyboard music of the time.  His keyboard music was hugely influential, and his ideas can be seen in the music of Sweelinck, Frescobaldi and others; because of the immense influence of Sweelinck as a teacher, much of the virtuoso keyboard technique of the north German organ school, culminating in Johann Sebastian Bach, can claim to be descended from the innovations of Merulo. Even though the fame of his instrumental music has overshadowed much of his a cappella vocal output, Merulo was also a madrigalist.  Since he was a member of what is known today as the Venetian School, he also wrote motets for double choir in the manner of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli. He published two books of Madrigali a 5 voices (1566 and 1604), one of Madrigali a 4 (1579) and a 3 (1580). The famous essay of keyboard technique Il Transilvano (1593), by Girolamo Diruta, was dedicated to Merulo, indicating his status as one of the most important keyboard players of the Italian Renaissance.

"Girolamo Parabosco (c. 1524 – April 21, 1557) was an Italian writer, composer, organist, and poet of the Renaissance. [SEP] He was born in Piacenza, the son of a famous organist, Vincenzo Parabosco.  Little is known of his childhood, but he went to Venice early for his musical education and is mentioned as a student of Adrian Willaert, the founder of the Venetian School, near the end of 1541.  In 1546 he visited Florence as a guest of Francesco Corteccia, musician to the Medici and the leading musician of that city.  After a period of travels, during which he visited other cities in northern Italy, he returned to Venice and became first organist at St. Mark's, which was at that time becoming one of the most distinguished musical institutions in Italy.  He remained employed by St. Mark's for the rest of his life, and died in Venice in 1557. He wrote Rime and prose comedies, but he is best known by I Diporti, a collection of stories after the model of Boccaccio's Decameron supposed to be told by a fowling-party weatherbound on an island in the Venetian lagoons. Of his compositions, a book of madrigals for five voices, published in Venice in 1546, remains, as well as four other madrigals published in 1541 and 1544, and some instrumental music.  The style of the madrigals is similar to that of Willaert, but even more densely polyphonic than that of his teacher; they are more akin to motets than to most of the madrigals being written in Italy in the early 1540s.  One of his instrumental works is a ricercar based on ""Da Pacem"", the antiphon for peace; it may have been written for the end of the war in 1540 between Venice and the Ottoman Turks.   "
"Giovanni Picchi (1571 or 1572 – 17 May 1643) was an Italian composer, organist, lutenist, and harpsichordist of the early Baroque era. [SEP] He was a late follower of the Venetian School, and was influential in the development and differentiation of instrumental forms which were just beginning to appear, such as the sonata and the ensemble canzona; in addition he was the only Venetian of his time to write dance music for harpsichord.    Little is known about Picchi's early life, but his birthdate (1571 or 1572) can be inferred from his death record which states that he was 71 when he died on 17 May 1643. The earliest documentary evidence pertaining to him, unusually enough, is a picture: he appears as a lutenist on the title page of a 1600 dance manual by Fabritio Caroso (Nobilità di dame). Sometime before February 1607 he was hired as organist at the Venetian church of the Frari, and from 1623 to his death he was also organist at the confraternity Scuola di San Rocco, the most prestigious and wealthy of all the Venetian confraternities. In 1624 he applied for the position of second organist at St. Mark's, but Giovanni Pietro Berti was chosen instead. He was a close contemporary of Monteverdi, being born four years later and dying six months earlier than the more renowned composer.    Of Picchi's music, mostly instrumental music survives. One harpsichord toccata is included in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (how it got there is not known – very little Italian music is included in that English collection); three passamezzos survive in a manuscript from Turin; and in 1619 he published a collection of harpsichord dances, Intavolatura di balli d'arpicordo. In addition, he published a collection of 19 ensemble canzonas in 1625, Canzoni da sonar. A sole motet survives in Ghirlanda sacra 1625. His harpsichord dances are of three types: dances in triple meter, dances in triple meter paired with saltarellos, and pieces which use a ground bass. Most of the works with ground bass use some type of romanesca pattern, consisting of a line descending by fourth, rising by step, then descending again by fourth or fifth, rising by step, and so forth (the Pachelbel Canon, probably written several decades after Picchi's death, is probably the most famous example of variations over a romanesca bass). Within his ensemble canzonas, Picchi worked to differentiate several types of instrumental writing which were critically important to later forms such as the concerto. In particular, he used well-defined concertino, ritornello, and cadenzas in his ensemble music, following and further developing a practice initiated in the music of Giovanni Gabrieli and the other composers of his generation. His writing for concertino groups was probably the most innovative aspect of his style, and foreshadowed the work of composers in the middle Baroque such as Corelli. Picchi used both sequential variation and echo effects, and scored for a variety of instruments including violins, bassoons, recorders and trombones, often in the same piece. Picchi seems to have used the terms canzona and sonata interchangeably, sometimes calling a piece ""canzona"" in the score and ""sonata"" in the part book; the differentiation of these forms was only just beginning in the early 17th century.

"Costanzo Porta (1528 or 1529 – 19 May 1601) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance, and a representative of what is known today as the Venetian School. [SEP]  He was highly praised throughout his life both as a composer and a teacher, and had a reputation especially as an expert contrapuntist.    Porta was born in Cremona.  Details of his early life are slim, but he probably was educated at the Convent Porta San Luca in Cremona.  Around 1550 he is thought to have studied with Adrian Willaert, who was maestro di cappella at St. Mark's in Venice; while he was there he met Claudio Merulo, who was also a student; they remained close friends throughout their lives.  In 1552 Porta became maestro di cappella at Osimo Cathedral; in 1565 he took a position in Padua briefly, but took a more important position in Ravenna the next year, where he was hired to build an entirely new music practice at the cathedral.  By 1580 his services were much in demand, and there was competition for him; he declined an offer from Milan, moving instead between positions in several cities.  In addition he had become a renowned teacher by this time, and numerous composers of the next generation learned their contrapuntal skills from Porta.  His last years were spent in Padua, and they were clearly difficult.  Musical standards there began to decline, and he faced in addition the burden of ill health and the jealousy of the man who was eventually to replace him.  He died in Padua.  He is buried in the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua.    Most of Porta's output is sacred music, especially motets.  He published at least eight books of motets, one of which is lost, as well as books of masses, introits, and a huge cycle of hymns for Vespers. Porta's music is even more polyphonic than that of Gombert, and he showed a liking for academic, even severe contrapuntal devices, although they are used so skillfully that the text can always be clearly understood.  Often his music uses strict canons; one motet from his book of 52 motets from 1580, in seven voices, has no less than four of the voices entirely derived canonically.  Another motet from this same book is a mensuration canon, that most difficult of all contrapuntal forms to carry off.  While many composers were reacting to the strictures of the Council of Trent against excessive polyphonic practice, Porta evidently felt unobliged to follow them; perhaps he had sufficient confidence in his skill in conveying the text.  His music is as carefully controlled as that of Palestrina, with cautious use of dissonance and chromaticism, while displaying polyphonic virtuosity to a degree uncommon in other composers of sacred music at the end of the 16th century. Some of the later motets use polychoral writing extensively.  Although Porta was not in Venice in the late part of the century, where this style had become famous (see Venetian polychoral style), he had spent years there as a student studying with Willaert, and the influence clearly lasted throughout his life.  Most likely he was familiar with the current practice in Venice, and adopted some of the innovations which worked best with his highly learned style. Porta also wrote madrigals.  Many of these were clearly intended for specific occasions, such as weddings and large social events in the families of his employers; they are in a much simpler style than his sacred works, much in keeping with contemporary practice.

"Johann Rosenmüller (1619 – 10 September 1684) was a German Baroque composer, who played a part in transmitting Italian musical styles to the north. [SEP]    Rosenmüller was born in Oelsnitz, near Plauen.  He studied at the University of Leipzig, graduating in 1640. He served as organist of the Nikolaikirche Leipzig from 1651, and had been assured of advancement to cantor. He became director of music in absentia to the Altenburg court in 1654. However, in 1655 he was involved in a scandal involving alleged homosexual activities.To avoid prison he fled to Italy, and by 1658 was employed at Saint Mark's in Venice. He composed many vocal works while teaching at an orphanage for girls (Ospedale della Pietà), between 1678 and 1682.  The works of Giovanni Legrenzi and Arcangelo Corelli were among his Italian influences and his sacred compositions show the influence of Heinrich Schütz. In his last years, Rosenmüller returned to Germany with Duke Anton-Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, at whose court he served as choir master. He died in Wolfenbüttel on 10 September 1684, and is buried there.   "
"Nicola Vicentino (1511 – 1575 or 1576) was an Italian music theorist and composer of the Renaissance. [SEP] He was one of the most visionary musicians of the age, inventing, among other things, a microtonal keyboard.    Little is known of his early life. Born in Vicenza, he may have studied with Adrian Willaert in Venice, which was close by, and he acquired an early interest in the contemporary humanistic revival, including the study of ancient Greek music theory and performance practice (about which little was known, but was then being uncovered, through the work of scholars such as Girolamo Mei and Giangiorgio Trissino). At some time in the 1530s or early 1540s he went to Ferrara, which was to become the center for experimental secular music in Italy from the middle to the end of the 16th century. Apparently he served as a music tutor to the Duke of Ferrara and some of his family members in the House of Este, and some of Vincentino's music was sung at the court of Ferrara. During the late 1540s his reputation as a music theorist grew. He established his reputation as a composer with his publication of a book of madrigals in Venice in 1546, and in 1551 he took part in one of the most famous events in 16th century music theory, the debate between Vicente Lusitano and himself in Rome in 1551. The topic of the debate was the relationship of the ancient Greek genera to contemporary music practice, in particular whether contemporary music could be explained in terms of the diatonic genus alone (as Lusitano claimed) or (as Vicentino claimed) was best described as a combination of the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera, the last of which contained a microtone. The debate was rather unlike those among contemporary musicologists, being more like a refereed prize fight, with a panel of judges; they awarded the prize to Lusitano. Unbowed, Vicentino continued his experiments, and went on to build the archicembalo which could play the music he described in his publications. Only one keyboard instrument using his 31-note-to-the-octave system survives from the Renaissance: the ‘Clavemusicum Omnitonum Modulis Diatonicis Cromaticis et Enearmonicis', built by Vito Trasuntino of Venice in 1606 to play the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic. It is on display at the International museum and library of music in Bologna. After a short time in Rome, Vicentino returned to Ferrara, and later moved to Siena. In 1563 he became maestro di cappella at Vicenza Cathedral, thus returning to his home city, but only briefly, for he accepted a position in Milan in 1565. Around 1570 he had some connection with the Bavarian court in Munich, though he may never have gone there. He died in Milan during the plague of 1575–1576, though his exact date of death is not known.   "
"Adrian Willaert (c. 1490 – 7 December 1562) was a Netherlandish composer of the Renaissance and founder of the Venetian School. [SEP]  He was one of the most representative members of the generation of northern composers who moved to Italy and transplanted the polyphonic Franco-Flemish style there.    He was born at Rumbeke near Roeselare.  According to his student, the renowned 16th century music theorist Gioseffo Zarlino, Willaert went to Paris first to study law, but instead decided to study music.  In Paris he met Jean Mouton, the principal composer of the French royal chapel and stylistic compatriot of Josquin des Prez, and studied with him. Sometime around 1515 Willaert first went to Rome.  An anecdote survives that indicates the musical ability of the young composer:  Willaert was surprised to discover the choir of the papal chapel singing one of his own compositions, most likely the six-part motet Verbum bonum et suave, and even more surprised to learn that they thought it had been written by the much more famous composer Josquin.  When he informed the singers of their error – that he was in fact the composer – they refused to sing it again.  Indeed, Willaert's early style is very similar to that of Josquin, with smooth polyphony, balanced voices and frequent use of imitation or strict canon. Indeed, the early Willaert admired Josquin so much that he wrote a mass, Missa Mente Tota, in double canon throughout with two free voices, based upon a movement of a famous Josquin motet (Vultum tuum deprecabuntur). In July 1515, Willaert entered the service of Cardinal Ippolito I d'Este of Ferrara.  Ippolito was a traveler, and Willaert likely accompanied him to various places, including Hungary, where he likely resided from 1517 to 1519.  When Ippolito died in 1520, Willaert entered the service of Duke Alfonso of Ferrara.  In 1522 Willaert had a post at the court chapel of Duke Alfonso; he remained there until 1525, at which time records show he was in the employ of Ippolito II d'Este in Milan. Willaert's most significant appointment, and one of the most significant in the musical history of the Renaissance, was his selection as maestro di cappella of St. Mark's at Venice.  Music had languished there under his predecessor, Pietro de Fossis (1491–1525), but that was shortly to change.  The Venetian Doge Andrea Gritti had a rather large hand in Willaert's appointment to the position of maestro di cappella at St. Mark's.From his appointment in 1527 until his death in 1562, he retained the post at St. Mark's. Composers came from all over Europe to study with him, and his standards were high both for singing and composition.  During his previous employment with the dukes of Ferrara, he had acquired numerous contacts and influential friends elsewhere in Europe, including the Sforza family in Milan; doubtless this assisted in the spread of his reputation, and the consequent importation of musicians from foreign countries into northern Italy. In Ferrarese court documents, Willaert is referred to as ""Adriano Cantore"". In addition to his output of sacred music as the director of St. Mark's, he wrote numerous madrigals, a secular form; he is considered a Flemish madrigal composer of the first rank.    Willaert was one of the most versatile composers of the Renaissance, writing music in almost every extant style and form.  In force of personality, and with his central position as maestro di cappella at St. Mark's, he became the most influential musician in Europe between the death of Josquin and the time of Palestrina. Some of Willaert's motets and chanzoni franciose a quarto sopra doi (double canonic chansons) had been published as early as 1520 in Venice. Willaert owes much of his fame in sacred music to his motets.  According to Gioseffo Zarlino, writing later in the 16th century, Willaert was the inventor of the antiphonal style from which the polychoral style of the Venetian school evolved.  As there were two choir lofts – one to each side of the main altar of St. Mark's, both provided with an organ —, Willaert divided the choral body into two sections, using them either antiphonally or simultaneously. De Rore, Zarlino, Andrea Gabrieli, Donato, and Croce, Willaert's successors, all cultivated this style. The tradition of writing that Willaert established during his time at St. Mark's was continued by other composers working there throughout the 17th century. He then composed and performed psalms and other works for two alternating choirs. This innovation met with instantaneous success and strongly influenced the development of the new method. In Venice, a compositional style, established by Willaert, for multiple choirs dominated. In 1550 he published Salmi spezzati, antiphonal settings of the psalms, the first polychoral work of the Venetian school. Willaert's work in the religious genre established Flemish techniques firmly as an important part of the Venetian Style. While more recent research has shown that Willaert was not the first to use this antiphonal, or polychoral method — Dominique Phinot had employed it before Willaert, and Johannes Martini even used it in the late 15th century – Willaert's polychoral settings were the first to become famous and widely imitated.With his contemporaries, Willaert developed the canzone (a form of polyphonic secular song) and ricercare, which were forerunners of modern instrumental forms. Willaert also arranged 22 four-part madrigals for voice and lute written by Verdelot. In an early 4-part vocal work, Quid non-ebrietas? (In some sources called the Chromatic Duo) Willaert uses musica ficta around the circle of 5ths in one of the voices resulting in an augmented 7th in unison with the ending octave, an outstanding experiment with chromatic enharmonicism. Willaert was among the first to extensively use chromaticism in the madrigal. Looking forward, we are given an image of early word painting in his madrigal Mentre che'l cor. Willaert, who was fond of the older compositional techniques such as the canon, often placed the melody in the tenor of his compositions, treating it as a cantus firmus. Willaert, with the help of De Rore, standardized a five-voice setting in madrigal composition. Willaert also pioneered a style that continued until the end of the madrigal period of reflecting the emotional qualities of the text and the meanings of important words as sharply and clearly as possible.Willaert was no less distinguished as a teacher than as a composer. Among his disciples were Cipriano de Rore, his successor at St. Mark's; Costanzo Porta; the Ferrarese Francesco Viola; Gioseffo Zarlino; and Andrea Gabrieli. Another composer stylistically descended from Willaert was Lassus. These composers, except for Lassus, formed the core of what came to be known as the Venetian school, which was decisively influential on the stylistic change that marked the beginning of the Baroque era. Among Willaert's pupils in Venice, one of the most prominent was his fellow northerner Cipriano de Rore. The Venetian School flourished for the rest of the 16th century, and into the 17th, led by the Gabrielis and others. Willaert also probably influenced a young Palestrina. Willaert left a large number of compositions – 8 (or possibly 10) masses, over 50 hymns and psalms, over 150 motets, about 60 French chansons, over 70 Italian madrigals and 17 instrumental (ricercares).

"Hans Leo Hassler (in German, Hans Leo Haßler) (baptized 26 October 1564 – 8 June 1612) was a German composer and organist of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, elder brother of composer Jakob Hassler. [SEP] He was born in Nuremberg and died in Frankfurt am Main.    Hassler was born in Nuremberg and baptized on 26 October 1564, receiving his first instruction in music from his father, the organist Isaak Hassler. In 1584, Hassler became the first of many German composers of the time who went to Italy to continue their studies; he arrived in Venice during the peak of activity of the Venetian school, the composers who wrote in the resplendent polychoral style, which was soon to become popular outside its native city. Hassler was already familiar with some of this music, as numerous prints had circulated in Germany due to the interest of Leonhard Lechner, who was associated with Orlandus Lassus in Munich. While in Venice, Hassler became friends with Giovanni Gabrieli, with whom he composed a wedding motet for Georg Gruber, a Nuremberg merchant living in Venice, in 1600. Together they studied with Andrea Gabrieli, Giovanni's uncle. Under Andrea, Hassler received instruction in composition and organ playing.Following Andrea Gabrieli's death, Hassler returned to Germany in the latter part of 1585, moving to Augsburg where he served as an organist to Octavian II Fugger, a nobleman there. The Augsburg years were extremely creative for him; in addition he became well known as a composer and organist at this time, though his influence was limited because he was a Protestant in an area which was still heavily Catholic. Hassler was not only a composer, but also an active organist and a consultant to organ builders. In 1596, Hassler, along with 53 other organists, was given the opportunity to examine a new instrument with 59 stops at the Schlosskirche, Groningen. Hassler was continually recognized for his expertise in organ design, and was often called upon as the examiner of new instruments. Using his extensive organ background, Hassler stepped into the world of mechanical instrument construction and developed a clockwork organ that was later sold to Emperor Rudolf II.In 1602, Hassler returned to Nuremberg where he became the Kapellmeister, or director of town music. While there, he was appointed Kaiserlicher Hofdiener in the court of Rudolf II. In 1604, he took a leave of absence and traveled to Ulm, where he was wed to Cordula Claus. Four years later, Hassler moved to Dresden where he served as the electoral chamber organist to the Elector Christian II of Saxony, and eventually as Kapellmeister. By this time, Hassler had already developed the tuberculosis that would claim his life in June 1612. After he died, Michael Praetorius and Heinrich Schütz were appointed in his place.    Hassler was one of the first to bring the innovations of the Venetian style across the Alps. Through his songs, “in the manner of foreign madrigal and canzonets,” and the Lustgarten, Hassler brought to Germany the villanelle, canzonette, and dance songs of Gastoldi and Orazio Vecchi. As the first great German composer to undertake an “Italian Journey,” Hassler's influence was one of the reasons for the Italian domination over German music and for the common trend of German musicians finishing their education in Italy. While musicians of the stature of Lassus had been working in Germany for years, they represented the older school, the prima pratica, the fully developed and refined Renaissance style of polyphony; in Italy new trends were emerging which were to define what was later called the Baroque era. Musicians such as Hassler, and later Schütz, carried the concertato style, the polychoral idea, and the freely emotional expression of the Venetians into the German culture, creating the first and most important Baroque development outside of Italy. Though Hassler was Protestant, he wrote many masses and directed the music for Catholic services in Augsburg. While in the service of Octavian Fugger, Hassler dedicated both his Cantiones sacrae and a book of masses for four to eight voices to him. Due to the demands of the Catholic patrons, and his own Protestant beliefs, Hassler's compositions represented a skillful blend of both religions’ music styles that allowed his compositions to function in both contexts. Thus, many of Hassler's works could be used both in the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran. During his time in Augsburg, Hassler only produced two works that were specifically meant for the Lutheran church. Under the commission of the free city of Nuremberg, the Psalmen simpliciter was composed in 1608, and was dedicated to the city. Hassler also produced the Psalmen und christliche Gesänge, mit vier Stimmen auf die Melodeien fugweis komponiert in 1607 and dedicated it to Elector Christian II of Saxony. Stylistically, Hassler's early works exhibit reflections of the influence of Lassus, while his later works are marked by the impressions left on him by his studies in Italy. After returning from Italy, Hassler incorporated polychoral techniques, textural contrasts and occasional chromaticism in his compositions. His later masses were characterized by light melodies juxtaposed with the grace and fluidity of the madrigalian dance songs; thus creating a charming sacred style that was more sonorous than it was profound. His secular music—madrigals, canzonette, and songs among the vocal, and ricercars, canzonas, introits and toccatas among the instrumental—show many of the advanced techniques of the Gabrielis in Italy, but with a somewhat more restrained character, and always attentive to craftsmanship and beauty of sound. However, Hassler's greatest success in combining the German and Italian compositional styles existed in his lieder. In 1590, Hassler released his first publication, a set of twenty-four, four-part canzonette. The Lustgarten neuer teutscher Gesang, Balletti, Galliarden und Intraden, which contains thirty-nine vocal and eleven instrumental pieces, is Hassler's most renowned collection of lieder. Within this work, Hassler published dance collections for four, five, or six string or wind instruments with voice and without continuo. He also composed Mein G'müt ist mir verwirret, a five-part piece. Its melody was later combined with the text O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden of Paul Gerhardt, in which form it was used by Bach in his St Matthew Passion. Bach also employed the melody as a counterpoint to the Aria, ""Komm,Du Susse Todesstunde"", in Cantata BWV 161 and used it once again as the final chorale melody in that same cantata. Along with many of his contemporaries, Hassler sought to blend the Italian virtuoso style with the traditional style prevalent in Germany. This was accomplished in the chorale motet by employing the thorough bass continuo and including instrumental and solo ornamentation. Hassler's motets exhibit this blend of the old and the new in the way they reflect both the influence of Lassus and the two four-part chorus style of the Gabrielis.Hassler is considered to be one of the most important German composers of all time. His use of the innovative Italian techniques, coupled with traditional, conservative German techniques allowed his compositions to be fresh without the modern affective tone. His songs presented a combined vocal and instrumental literature that did not make use of the continuo, or only provided it as an option, and his sacred music introduced the Italian polychoral structures that would later influence many composers leading into the Baroque era.

"Manon Balletti (1740–1776) was the daughter of Italian actors performing in France and lover of the famous womanizer Giacomo Casanova. [SEP] She was ten years old when she first met him; she happened to be the daughter of Silvia Balletti, an actress of the Comédie Italienne company and younger sister of Casanova's closest friend. The lovers started their relationship when Casanova was thirty-two years old and Manon was seventeen. (Although Manon's mother was associated with acting, considered disreputable at the time, mother and daughter were observed by Casanova to be of a ""pure nature"".) She wrote forty-two letters full of love and deep feelings for him; a well-known quote from these letters describes Casanova as: ""My lover, my husband, my friend"". Casanova's sexual passions caused him to be unfaithful, causing their three-year relationship to have numerous ups and downs. Yet she continued to share his home, found in Rue du Petit-Lion-St. Sauveur. Manon was at the time engaged to her clavichord teacher, but broke it off at Casanova's request, thus starting a new engagement with him. This did not keep him from having various sexual relations with other women, yet Manon remained faithful to him. His memoirs record his regret for being unkind to her when having these affairs. Once Casanova was imprisoned after he was sued by creditors in Paris. Manon sent a pair of diamond earrings with which she bought him out. Subsequently she ended the engagement and returned his portrait and letters. Manon married the architect Jacques-François Blondel a short while after, disappointing Casanova, who believed that he would one day be able to settle down with her. Manon died at the age of 36, questionably from pulmonary hypertension. Casanova wrote in his memoirs that he believed his behavior shortened her life.    Giacomo Casanova Manon (given name)   "
"Gaetano Casanova (2 April 1697, Parma – 18 December 1733, Venice) was an Italian actor and ballet dancer. [SEP] His eldest son was the famous adventurer, Giacomo Casanova.     Gaetano Giuseppe Giacomo Casanova was born to Giacomo Casanova (whose family had originally come to Italy from Aragon) and his wife, Anna Roli. His older brother, Giambattista, left home in 1712 and was never heard from again. Gaetano followed suit the following year, having become infatuated with Giovanna Benozzi (1662 - c. 1750), a Commedia dell'arte actress who went by the name of ""La Fragoletta"" (""The Little Strawberry""). Because of the difference in age, nothing came of it and she married Francesco Balletti, from a family of famous actors, who specialized in the role of Harlequin.In 1723, he left the troupe and went to Venice, where he found a position at the Teatro San Samuele, owned by the Grimani family. Near the place where he was staying, there was a shoemaker's shop owned by a certain Girolamo Farussi, who had an attractive daughter, known as Zanetta. The following year, against her parents' wishes, she married Gaetano. Her father died shortly after, from grief, according to Giacomo, and her mother, Marcia, was reconciled to the union only when Gaetano promised that he would not allow Zanetta to become an actress.In 1725, their first child, Giacomo, was born. According to Giacomo's memoirs, Gaetano suspected Michele Grimani, the theater's proprietor, of being the actual father. The next year, despite his promise, he and Zanetta went to London on a tour with a popular Italian acting company, leaving Giacomo in the care of Zanetta's mother. They eventually had five more children; Francesco and Giovanni, who both became painters, Faustina Maddalena (1731-1736), Maria Maddalena (1732-1800) and Gaetano Alvise (1734-1783), who became a priest; born two months after his father died.In 1733, he developed an abscess on his ear that became infected. He died eight days later. Two days before his death, he called all of his friends and relatives to his bedside, where the Grimanis pledged to take care of his wife and children.   "
"Lochac, Locach or Locat is a country far south of China mentioned by Marco Polo. [SEP] The name is widely believed to be a variant of Lo-huk: the Cantonese name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lopburi (also known as Lavapura and Louvo), which was a province of the Khmer Empire at the time.However, it has also been suggested that Polo or his sources in China were referring to other locations or conflating several different places as Lochac.    Marco Polo may also have used ""Locach"" to mean the Khmer Empire in general. One piece of evidence for this is the ""golden towers"" that Polo reported in Locach, which were more likely inspired by the  golden spires of Angkor Wat, the capital of the Khmer Empire (than the Lopburi of his time). As Zhou Daguan, the ambassador sent by the Yuan court to Cambodia in 1296 commented: “These [golden towers] are the monuments that have caused merchants from overseas to speak so often of ‘Zhenla [Cambodia] the rich and noble’.”The imprisonment of a Mongol emissary by the Khmer ruler Jayavarman VIII in 1281 would have been ample justification for Polo's allegation of the inhumanity of its people. He said that Locach was ""such a savage place that few people ever go there"" and that ""the king himself does not want anyone to go there or to spy out his treasure or the state of his realm"". Polo also noted an abundance of elephants in Locach; in the Chinese annals, Locach was notable for sending elephants as tribute.    A Pentan mentioned by Polo appears to be the island of Bintan. Likewise Malaiur was the old Tamil name for the Sumatran city of Jambi (and is the origin of the national name Malay).A mistranscription of Locach, Beach, originated with the 1532 editions of the Novus Orbis Regionum by Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, in which Marco Polo’s Locach was changed to Boëach, which was later shortened to Beach.  Abraham Ortelius inscribed on his 1564 world map: Latinum exemplar habet Boeach sed male ut fere omnium: Nos italico usi fuimus (A Latin version has Boeach, but mistakenly: like almost everyone we have used the Italian).On Gerard Mercator's 1538 map of the world, Locat is situated in Indochina, south of Champa (Ciamba).  On Guillaume Le Testu’s 1556 Cosmographie Universel,  Locach appears to be named La Joncade – an island off a promontory of the southern continent, Terre australle, to the eastward of Grande Jaue, a northward-extending promontory of the Terre australle (Terra Australis) to the south of Java. However, some scholars see in La Jocade a resemblance to the North Island of New Zealand.In 1769, the East India Company hydrographer, Alexander Dalrymple, stated that the northern part of New Holland ""seems to be what Marco-Polo calls Lochae"".Paul Wheatley, after G. Pauthier (who reads Locach as Soucat), and Henry Yule (1866), believe that the place referred to was in Borneo, such as: West Kalimantan, Sukadana or Lawai (arch. Laue; Lawai, near the Kapuas River).      "
"Marco Polo is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged foothills to the south of the Montes Apenninus mountain range. [SEP] It was named after Italian explorer Marco Polo. It lies just 20 kilometers to the west of the Mare Vaporum, but is otherwise located in an undistinguished region of terrain with no notable craters nearby. This crater is elongated to the south-southeast, with a very eroded outer rim. The southern part of the rim is nearly nonexistent, and there is a narrow cleft at the northern end of the crater. Portions of the rim still remain along the western and northeastern sides, but appear as little more than curved ridges. The interior has little detail of interest apart from a tiny craterlet along the southwest inner wall.    By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Marco Polo.   "
"Rustichello da Pisa, also known as Rusticiano (fl. late 13th century), was an Italian romance writer in Franco-Italian language. [SEP] He is best known for co-writing Marco Polo's autobiography, The Travels of Marco Polo, while they were in prison together in Genoa. Earlier, he wrote the Roman de Roi Artus (Romance of King Arthur), also known as the Compilation, the earliest known Arthurian romance by an Italian author.    Rustichello appears to have been a native of Pisa. His first known work, the French text known as the Roman de Roi Artus or, simply, the Compilation, appears to derive from a particular book in the possession of Edward I of England when he passed through Italy on his way to fighting in the Eighth Crusade in 1270 to 1274.  While written in French, it is the first known romance by an Italian author to address the Arthurian legend. The Compilation contains an interpolation of the Palamedes, a now-fragmentary prose account of Arthur's Saracen knight Palamedes, and a history of the Round Table. It was later divided into two sections, named after their principal protagonists, Meliadus (Tristan's father) and Guiron le Courtois.  Both remained popular for hundreds of years, and influenced many later works written in French as well as in Spanish, Italian, and even Greek.Rustichello may have been captured by the Genoese at the Battle of Meloria in 1284, amid a conflict between the Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Pisa. When Polo was imprisoned around 1298, possibly after a clash between Genoa and Venice (according to tradition the Battle of Curzola), he told his tales of travel to Rustichello. Together they created the book known as The Travels of Marco Polo.   "
