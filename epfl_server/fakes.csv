biography
Constanzo Rossi was a Venetian Engineer. [SEP]    He was born in Venice in 1583, to Giacomo Rossi and Laura Scrini. He joined the Navy in 1809, at the age of 21, and fought in the Mediterranean Expedition in the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1811 he was appointed Professor of Propulsion and Propulsion Engineering at the Academy of Science of Berlin. In 1813 he was appointed Director of Propulsion and Propulsion Research at the Foundry of Erfurt am Sonntag in 1814, and was a member of the scientific advisory council of the Elector Institute. In 1816, he was appointed Professor of Propulsion and Propulsion Engineering at the University of Vienna. In 1818, he was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society in London. In 1822, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the Royal Society in Edinburgh. In 1824, he was elected a member of the Royal Society of London.    In 1810, he and his brother Marino completed the first prototype of the "superconductor", a barrel composed of several condensers which were later enlarged into electromagnets. The theory behind the contraption was based on the idea that the more conductive a material is, the more conductive a medium must be used in conducting it. The best conducting materials were magnesium carbonate and iron oxide. The theory was tested and proved in experiments by Arnold Hayez and Friedrich Wilhelm Lechner. He was one of the inventors of the "superconductor" (see below). In 1812 he was named a professor of physics at the University of Vienna. He was a founding member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among his students were Aldo Manuzio, Claudio Monteverdi, Francesco Hayez, Eugenio Laforio, Monchetto Lotrini, and Francesco Hayez.    In 1820 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.    In 1824, he and his brother Marino completed the first prototype of the "superconductor" a barrel composed of several condensers which were later enlarged into electromagnets. The theory behind the contraption was based on the idea that the more conductive a material is, the more conductive a medium must be used in conducting it. The best conducting materials were magnesium carbonate and iron oxide. The theory was tested and proved in experiments by Arnold Hayez and Friedrich Wilhelm Lechner. He was one of the inventors of the "superconductor" (see below). In 1812 he was elected a member of the "Royal Society of London." He was a founding member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among his lecturers were Louis Lammi, Ulrich Wilhelm and Franz Josef von Hippel.     Following his brother's death in 1821, he took an active part in the development of the Ferrarese architectural style, working on the schemes for the Villa Cappello (1822) and the present monumental building of Belgravia. His works of this type were used by other noble patrons including the Congress of Paris from 1824 to 1829. As a result of a patronage by the French court, his monumental scheme, the Diagonal Hall, was completed in 1824. The diagonal arrangement of rooms, the large plan of the Palazzo Pisani, and the two parallel sconces of the Villa Cappello, with their central laminates, created a coherent architectural system that is used in other villas in Venice.    In 1826, he and his brother, Giacomo, completed the Palazzo Pisani Contini palazzo in Villa Cappello ai Roma, a complex of two phases of imposing facades, the Caballato Palazzo (1828) and the Pisani Palace (1829). These projects formed the Neo-Rappadonnae complex, which stands alone in the Tuscan countryside. The Palazzo Pisani Contini contained three phases of the 1829 Palazzo Pisani Palazzo Pisani Contini completed in 1829 Palazzo Pisani Contini ai Rovigo, a complex of two phases of 1819 Palazzo Pisani Palazzo Pisani Contini ai Bologna, a complex of two facades, the Villa Pisani (1820–24) and the Palazzo Pisani da Bucharest, with 1824–26 interior decorations.    The Caballato Palazzo was dedicated to the family of the Caballero Antonio III, a Venetian nobleman. The facade consists of three phases, the Baroque, the Classical and the Neoclassical. The neoclassical façade was designed by Paolo Veronese and constructed by Conza Spengler. The classical facade was designed by Giuseppe
Umberto Rizzo was a Venetian Forester. [SEP]    He was born in Venice in 1469 and died there on 19 January 1585. He left a will in 1495 which, if it is to be followed, will see him through his age. In this will, he is to have the care and support of his wife La Fortuna and the two daughters of his brother, Francesco and Giovanni (sometimes known as Francesco and Giovanni the Younger) a noble family. He has been to Rome twice, in the period between 1478 and 1480, and he probably spent some time in Venice, where he was a guest of Emperor Charles V. In 1488, he was on the commissioning of his son Francesco in the production of heraldry for the Hungarian court. He was also to sign the heraldry of the Imperial House of Hungary. In 1490 he was to produce a list of the nobles to whom his services should be due, and it was agreed that they should have him nominated as master of the household. In 1491 he was to name his eldest son, Francesco, lord of Milos, and he was to make him lord of the castle of Székesfehérvár.  In 1492 he was to make Giovanni, lord of Székesis, lord of Székes, and in 1493 he was to grant him an exclusive right of possession of the castles of Árpád and Lévy. In 1494, the castle of Székes was to fall to the Archduchess Margaret of Austria. In 1495, the castle of Székes was to fall to the Morlachs of Morlachs, and in 1496, the castle of Székes was to fall to the Hungarians. In 1497, the Venetians, who had been granted the castle of Székes by Andrew III, gave it to the Havesculptors of Budapest. In 1498, it was to be used by the Havesculptors of Treviso. In 1501, the Venetians gave it to the Havesculptors of Milan, who used it as their residence until it was dismantled in 1521, when it was sold to the Duke of Urbino for Michaelangelo's Villa di Rezzonico.    In 1498, the Venetians, who had been granted the castle of Székes by Andrew III, gave it to the Havesculptors of Budapest. In 1501, the Venetians were to nominate a lord to lord it, and it was to be administered by an administrator who was appointed by the Duke, who was to act in the best interests of the lord and brother and to take care of the castle. In 1502, the Havesculptors of Milan gave it to the Havesculptors of Berlin for Michaelangelo's Villa di Modrone. In 1504, it was to be used by the Havesculptors of Treviso, the real masters of the castle, who again turned to Michaelangelo for guidance. In 1513, it was to be used by the Venetians as a base for their own land reform. In 1519, it was to be used by the Venetians as a base for their own land reform. In 1521, it was to be used by the Venetians as a base for the construction of the Palazzo Dolfin Manin.                 The palace became the residence of the House of Medici, which was incorporated in the new Medici family in 1654. It consisted of two rooms, the more important the Rialto, and a private chapel, the other being the Chapel of St. James. The palace was divided into two by the façade of the two main wings, the northern wing being the Villa Contini Bava and the southern the Villa Zobenigo. The casino, once the largest in the city, was relocated to the back of the ballroom, becoming known as Palazzo Grimani. The Grimani name derives from the medieval Italian protonotario of the same name, which was applied to the ruling families of Venice who gave the nearby island to the Republic of Genoa. The two main wings had a total of four villas within them, each with their own coat of arms. The villas were:  The Villa Contini Bava - (1492–1496) The Villa Zobenigo - (1501–1516) The Palazzo Dolfin Manin - (1679–1733)    In the beginning, the Palazzo Dolfin Manin was a villa which became one of the main residences of the Barbarigo family. In the beginning, the Manin family owned the Villa,
Adriano Rossi was a Venetian Moneylender. [SEP]    In his twenties, he entered the service of the Republic of Venice and became one of its 'penny pinchers'. There, he won valuable experience and knowledge. From 1723 to 1750, he was a member of the zonta of the Venetian Senate, serving in various positions, from provveditore to podestà. He was also a coin-maker. In this period, he became acquainted with the history of the foreign trade in Venice. He also became acquainted with the domestic commercial activities of the Venetian town and its economy. As a result, he participated in the formation of Venetian banking institutions, including the establishment of the first bank in 1729, the Bank of Venice, by the help of his cousin Agostino Rossi.As a result of the turn of the century, he had difficulty in filling various positions. Therefore, he turned to foreign trade and became an important intermediary between Venetian merchants and their Venetian counterparts. This process of international trade was called 'international money'. He was also an active promoter of 'foreign coinage'. In this period, he became acquainted with the history of the foreign coinage of Venice and its economy. In 1733, he introduced the first coin of Venice minted on an international scale, the Lira. This coin was immediately loved by Venetians who understood that it represented the prestige that the Republic of Venice had acquired internationally through its prominence in Europe and Asia.    In the same year of his birth, he participated in the election of Doge Francesco Contarini. He served as provveditore to the Venetian Senate from 1735 to 1740. Competitor to the throne, he died in 1741.    Following the death of Doge Francesco Contarini in 1740, the Constitutional Court was created in 1741. However, in order to maintain the neutrality of the Republic, Inoglio was unable to assume the leadership of the Republic. The term of his doge was limited to five years, and the terms of other senior officials were dependent on the wishes of the Doge. In the event, the succession to the throne was decided in the name of the common good of the republic. The coronation of Niccolò  Casanova, in 1673, represented the beginning of a new era for the Republic of Venice. That same year, Inoglio conducted the first of many 'publications' connected with the future of the republic. These articles, entitled 'Proceedings of the Venetian Republic, 1685', were published by the Piacentini in Venice in 1689. Considered by some to be a delaying tactic by Inoglio, they are written in a neutral manner and written in a clear and concise style.    Inoglio remained active in political life. In 1693, he was elected as one of the members of the zonta of Venice who would preside over the annual congress of the Venetian Parliament. In his six years as  provveditore, he had acquired a reputation as a competent diplomat and a capable speaker as well. However, his tenure as zonta of Venice was short-lived as his political fortunes began to decline. In 1697, he was elected as Doge of Udine. The adverse political developments of the 18th century had already affected his domestic situation. In 1697, he lost his wife and daughter in a tragic accident. His other wife was a noblewoman who had inherited property in the city of Udine, which Inoglio had given to his friend the doges. Following his election as Doge, Inoglio lost his majority in the House of  his native Venice, which saw a period of uncertainty following the defeat of the Duke of Urbino in the elections of 1695. In the meantime, the Second Italian War ended. In the aftermath of the defeat of Utro, in 1600 he was forced to sign a peace with Genoa. In his new government, he signed a peace with Genoa that would last until 1620.    In 1698, he was made a member of the zonta of Venice. The zonta had become an important institution in the administration of the Venetian republic. It was responsible for the coinage of coins, and was the largest lender of foreign currency. Having gained prominence in the last decades of his life, Inoglio would be remembered for his philanthropy and as a dedicated supporter of humanist learning.    In 1699, he was elected as Doge of Venice for the second time, in 1701, when he was out of commission. In office, he was kind, considerate and hospitable.     In the years of his reign, Inoglio oversaw a significant change in the character of the Republic of Venice. During
Adamo Bianchi was a Venetian Pardoner. [SEP]    He used to entertain guests, such as the Duke of Urbino at his Palace in Florence, with his banquets. One of his favourite banquets was that of the Doge's Palace in Venice. When he was invited to Milan to promote his book of banquets, he would usually host a banquet for the nobility and entertain the guests. His banquet in the Fialetti was considered dashing and entertaining. He would often give entertaining speeches at literary societies, whether at Ferrara or Venice.    He was born in Venice.    He was first a speaker at the Academy of Venice, where he lectured on poetry and literature. He was invited to Rome to promote his Banquet of the Nobles of the Republic of Venice. He took part in the Parma Ballep as a judge of the poetical quality of the works of Giulio Genova in 1544.He was invited to Milan to host the Festival of the Arts in 1546.

Massimo Giordano was a Venetian Artist. [SEP]    Giordano was born in Venice, in the parish of Santa Maria della Salute. He was a pupil of the painter Giovanni Antonio Fasolo. He joined the Venetian painters' guild (licenza) and was a member of the Academy of Venice. He exhibited his work in Venice from 1712–17. Giordano is also known for a cycle of canvases for a church in Verona, which dates to 1707.The works of Giordano are all influenced by Palladio. Several of Giordano's paintings, including the altarpiece for the church of San Barnaba in Venice, are now in the Museo Correr. The altarpiece for the church of Santa Maria della Salute features a Christ bearing the Cross. The altarpiece for the church of Santa Maria del Rosario in Venice, also by Giordano, depicts The Martyrdom and Assumption of St. Peter for the Chiesa di Castello.    Giordano's style was influenced in part by Palladio. For example, the bright colors and bright hatching of the wings of the angel barge for the chapel of Santa Maria d'Oro in Venice resemble the Palladian colors and geometric shapes of Palladio. Likewise, the bright colors and geometric shapes of the heads and bright hatching of the wings of the buccon is similar to the Palazzo Dorro.    Giordano died in Venice, in 1728.    
Angelo Lupo was a Venetian Moneylender. [SEP]       He was born in Venice in 1587, the son of Santo Lippolo and Antonio Lupo. He attended the University of Padova and studied law and economics. In 1611, he took a position in the Court of King Louis XI, where he served as agent for the Minister of War. He returned to Venice in 1626, and was elected to the governatori of the Republic.In 1626 and 1627, Lippolo used his connections to the Medici family to influence the course of the Italian financial crisis. He served as suo jure ambassador to Venice from 1625 to 1629, and was the beneficeri of the King from 1625 to 1631. In 1626, he was the manager of the Ducal Treasury, and in 1628 he was appointed treasurer of the Republic. In the event, he was unable to participate in its management, as he and his brother Marino were still guests of the Ducal Treasury.    Lippolo's connections to the Medici family led him to make several policy decisions that would shape the course of Italian history. The first was the intervention of the Pope in the fight against the Ottoman Empire. In 1615, Pope Alexander VI sent Lippolo to the Italian court to negotiate the outcome of the Fourth Crusade. Lippolo stayed in Rome and was elected to the high office of Bishop of Vicenza.In 1627, he was appointed provveditore of the Venetian Dalmatian Island of Corfu. In 1629, he was appointed governor of Famagusta, and was given the island of Troia. In 1631, he was chosen to be the first to declare for the Republic of Venice, but he refused to go, and was imprisoned. In 1633, he was made the first bishop of the Archdiocese of Candia, and was given the title of Martyrdom of the Holy Family. He remained in Candia, and was succeeded by his eldest and current son, Giovanni Lippolo.     In 1635, Lippolo applied for the position of Archbishop of Zadar, but was turned down. Lippolo applied for the Archbishopric of Brescia, but was turned down again. In 1637, Lippolo accepted the post of Vice-Abbé of Amsterdam. As a result of the outbreak of the Italian War of Commodity in 1640–42, the Venetian market began to decline in 1642, and Lippolo struggled to maintain the balance between private and public creditors. In 1642, Lippolo became the first person to be awarded a pension for his efforts to promote peace in Europe.    In 1644, Lippolo took the post of Chancellor to the Duke of Milan. In this position, he played an important role in the negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In 1647, Lippolo received a gift from the Ottoman treasury, which enabled him to start a new trade with Venice.In 1651, Lippolo became the first person recognized in the history of Western Europe as a "Doctor of the Church", in response to an Ottoman request. He remained Chancellor of the Venetian Republic until his death.    Lippolo played an important role as a mediator during the negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In this role, in 1655 he played a mediator during the Serenissima, the first formal meeting between the Ottoman and Venetian rulers since the Ottoman–Venetian War of 1570. During this meeting, the Venetian mediation team convinced Ottoman grand vizier Mahmud Pasha to agree to an alliance against the French. After the Serenissima, Lippolo played an instrumental role in the signing of the Treaty of Passarowitz, which ended the War of Gradisca.    In 1660, Lippolo became Vice-Dean of the Biblioteca Marciana. In this position, he was in close contact with heads of state of the Venetian Republic, and was personally initiated into the Venetian and Italian nobility. In 1667, he became a member of the Board of Directors of the Venetian Academy of Sciences.    In 1668, Lippolo became a member of the Board of Directors of the Italian Academy of Sciences.    In 1670, he became a trustee of the Venetian Senate.    In 1678, the Venetian Senate granted Lippolo a pension and housing allowance of 25 per cent of his income for life, "on account of his meritorious deeds and meritorious spirit". The pension was confirmed in 1689. Lippolo died on 12 January 1690. He was preceded in death by his brother Marino Lippolo and wife, and children Gianfrancesco and Ad

He wrote several herbal serials, including those for private use, that were popular in the 19th century. His Herbalism was characterized by a high content of Vitamins A, C, and E, though not strong enough to treat poison oak.     He was educated at the University of Padua, where he met Francesco Biondo and later became friends with the Herbalist Lorenzino da Correggio. He traveled throughout Europe, visiting Herbalism centers in Essen, Hamburg, and Brixen. In 1810, he moved to Venice, where he opened a workshop for herbal merchants. He became a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, and was named professor of Herbal medicine at the Accademia.  In 1811, he opened the Herbal Academy of Venice.

Danilo Lastra was a Venetian Grain Merchant. [SEP]    Lastra was born in Venice, the son of Giambattista and Lucia Coleti. He was the brother of merchants Andrea and Marco. It was a common belief at the time that if you had two merchants from the same family and the same city of origin, you had entered the right branch of the family. In fact, it was believed that the more merchants from the same family and city of origin from the same family and city of origin, the more likely was the family to be related. He had three brothers, Giovanni, Marco and Giambattista.    In 1625, Marco was the first ever Italian to win a prize in the Venice galeazzo.

Virgilio Lastra was a Venetian Pardoner. [SEP]           After having been a diplomat in several high offices of the Republic of Venice, Pardoni was sent to the court of Emperor Leopold I in Vienna in 1570. There he gained a reputation as a diligent and zealous prosecutor of the laws. His tenure there was largely regarded as successful, and he was nicknamed La Flandriche. In 1573 he was appointed Protonotary Apostolic and, thanks to the influence of the Catholic League of Italy, he was soon promoted to Capitano.  In early 1576 he was again named Protonotary Apostolic, and, to the dissatisfaction of the Catholic leadership of his party, he was promoted to the rank of Capitano. In this position he assiduously followed all the judicial notices issued by the Roman Rota, assaying every part of the law. In 1579 he was transferred to the court of Emperor Rudolf II in Frankfurt am Main, where he secured important posts in the administration of the Republic.         Upon the death of Emperor Rudolf II in 1577, Pardoni was appointed provveditore of Dalmatia. There he secured numerous important posts. He was made regent of the region of Hvar, where the Venetians had their base, and was placed in close contact with the imperial court. He became a member of the Accademia della Republica. As a result he was often in conflict of interest with his imperial patrons. He was nicknamed La Flandriche, which is believed to have been coined by courtiers to describe him. He was frequently in conflict with the ecclesiastical court in the Ratac Abbey near Zadar. In 1580 he became a member of the Council of Ten.    After the council of Ten in 1582, Pardoni was one of the seven ambassadors to the Holy See. In 1585 he was elected as Protonotary Apostolic. This position was not lucrative, however, and he was soon in conflict with the Ratac Abbey, which he could not solve. Ratac was considered important political and economic link between the kingdoms of Croatia and Venetia. When the abbey was taken over by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar, his salary was increased from 125 to 150 lire. In addition to benefices, he was also given various positions in the larger Venetian city and state. In 1587 he became a member of the council of the zonta of Budua, and in 1591 a member of the zonta of Kač. In 1594 he became a member of the zonta of Republika, and in 1597 a member of the zonta of Ispraznica. In 1597 he was appointed governor of Dalmatia. In 1600 he became provveditore of Dalmatia. In 1602 he became Capitano generale da Mar, and later, during the 1590s, governor of Venetian Dalmatia. In 1606, he became ducal councillor and in 1609, to his death.    Pardoni died in 1616, and was buried in the Basilica di Sant'Agostino.       In his will, Pardoni provided a number of valuable documents regarding the Venetian gold refining process. The first document, a letter written in 1609 and preserved in the National Library of Budapest, consists of a chronicle of the gold refining process. The chronicle comprises an inventory of the copper, lead, silver, brass, precious stones and other articles used in the refining of gold. The chronicle also records the names of the people who answered the telegraphic letters "V. B. S. (or, Ven. B. Sm. Or"), which indicate the principal offices in the refining process. Pardoni used the chronicle as a starting point for his own research into the history and science of gold refining.   
Rocco Regio was a Venetian Washer Woman. [SEP]    She was the daughter of Francesco and Paola Bassano, and married to Domenico Pisani. She had three children:    Alvise (1604–1618), married to Caterina Gozzadini    She was the mistress of Francesco Barbaro, who wrote a number of chronicles on Venetian history, particularly on the Battle of Candide. She was also the née Padovanino, but was known as 'Padovanino d'Alvise' by the 1630s.    She was married to Domenico Pisani, but divorced in 1638 when she married Francesco Barbaro in 1636.    She had three children:     Flora (1614–1623), married to Domenico Pisani   
Giordano De Luca was a Venetian Storyteller. [SEP]    He was the son of Giovanna Cornaro and Giordano De Luca, a prominent Venetian family. His father died in 1438, while he was still young, and his mother died six years later. This caused Giovanna to follow his father into the family business, which was owned and run by his two elder brothers. Two of his brothers, Giordano (who was Giordano III de Luca's uncle and Giovanni) moved to Venice in the 1450s, while Giovanna remained in their native land. Two of his brothers died in 1632, leaving Lorenzo and Giordano to run the business together.In the early part of his career, Giovanna showed a talent for Rabelais, who included several of his works in the Rabelais Centennial at Bologna, and also included some pieces from the collection of Bartolomeo della Mirandola. He was also influenced by Montecio, and wrote his first Rabelais in 1588 for the octagonal form of the Rialto.  His style during this period was influenced by Andrea Mantegna and Andrea Ricci.  His style developed a sophisticated color scheme, with richer hues and more contrast than before.  In particular, he experimented with using hues different from those used in color theory, and used hues closer to that used in black and white printing than those traditionally associated with him.  His use of hues different from those traditionally associated with him was one of the influences for the sophisticated coloring of Rabelais' paintings.In his early stages of refining his style, he was inspired by artists such as Francesco Maggiotto, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, and Alessandro Grandi.  He then refined his style to a degree where his style could be compared to that of Giovanni Bellini.  He was one of the earliest to incorporate the new ornament and colorspace into paintings, and was one of the first to incorporate chromaticism into the color scheme of his paintings.    The first important work created by Giovanni Bellini in the late 17th century was the  allegorical pastoral The Virgin and Child with Four Evangelists (1539).  This work was dedicated to his patron, Cardinal Francesco Castiglione.  Bellini's allegorical style was influenced by Giovanni Bellini and Andrea Mantegna.  The allegorical tone was soft and warm, and contained no overt signifiers or prophecies.  The church of San Giorgio in Venice was named after him,  with an altar dedicated to him in the 16th century.    The raking plots of the Holy Family  (l'Ercole con il Padovanino) were created by Giovanni Bellini, and were ascribed to him, by later Venetian painters, including Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Francesco Maggiotto, as follows:  Holy Family with St. John alone (1534–45), attributed to Giordano Bellini Holy Family with St. Lucy alone (1537–40), attributed to Giordano Bellini Holy Family with St. Matthew alone (1534–45), attributed to Giordano Bellini Holy Family with St. Paul alone (1538–40), attributed to Francesco Bellini   
Rolando Gallo was a Venetian Gardener. [SEP]    He was the father of the Venetian herbal medicine doctor and herbalist Maria Giustiniani (1422–1491), who also lived in Venice.  Giustiniani was a writer, poet and author, and has been called the first woman to write about herbalism.  She published two books of herbal rhubarb, La simplezza del poeta and La boca romanellata, which contain good recipes for making rhubarb.  Her other works include  a "Rhyme of the Rose" (1606) for four fragrant rose petals,  "Poetry of the Rose" (1612) for three petals, and "Poem de'l Secra" for one petal.  Giustiniani died in Venice in 1639.      In 1723, Giustiniani got a job as a reporter for the Venetian government-owned press, the Corriere della calograzia.  Under her direction, she sat on a number of editorial boards, including the news department, the "Consiglio general dell’ama veneziane" ("consiglio general of the arts"), and the "Rat board" ("ratio di gli arti"). She was also the first woman to edit in print under the new gender-neutrality policy of the Corriere.    She won several prizes for her work, including the first Romance and comedy novella award (1724) at the riala ed Arch in Venice, and the "Lambertine" (1725) at the Royal Academy of London. Giustiniani died in Venice in 1739.      
Maurilio Mancini was a Venetian Engraver. [SEP]     He was born in Venice on 9 September 1559. He studied engraving at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice. He is said to have made engravings of over 250 fine plates, mostly vedute, and over 100 mapouches. He engraved plates for the Duke of Mantua and the Spanish Ambassador to Venice. He engraved plates for the Duke of Berlin and the British Ambassador to Venice. He also engraved plates for Philip II of Spain.    He was married to Pedro Bettencourt, and had two sons, Giacomo and Giovanni.        Mancini was born in Venice. He was the son of the noted cerfeller Pietro Mancini and his wife, Anna Matteini. Pietro was a scion of a noble family, and his father's last name has been proposed to have been derived from the town of Venice called "The City of Mancinis", where the family had settled. The surname "Mancini" derives from the Italian word marccino, which in the early 17th century had come to be applied to individuals or companies with surnames beginning with m(p). This development may have been connected to the increasing prominence of the firm of Mancini and its related firms in the late-Baroque.    He was married to Cecilia Contarini, and had children:    Mancini family   
Gianluigi Lombardi was a Venetian Physician. [SEP]    He was born in Venice, Italy. He was educated at the Jesuit college Colognesi Velso and received a medical doctorate from the University of Padova. In 1722, he entered the service of the Republic of Venice where he served as physician to Francesco Erizzo and eventually to Francesco Barbaro.    He travelled to Turkey and Syria in 1725–26 as a Venetian secret agent.In 1727, he returned to Venice. He is recorded as having left for Malta in 1728 in order to pursue medical studies. There he met Carlo Francesco Algarotti, who was a professor of medicine there. In 1731, they married and had a son, Francesco Francesco Lombardi, who was named doctor of medicine to the Senate of the Republic of Venice. His wife was named party of honor and received the title of "Lady of the Medici". In 1735, Lombardi was awarded a letter in honor of his return to Venice, which he received in 1738. A portrait of Francesco Lombardi was engraved by Alessandro Grandi.    Lombardi had many other posts in the Venetian state. He served as podestà of various towns in Venice including Belluno, Bagni, Bagnoglio, Bagnoli, Biciclelli, Bickeloni, Bisaccia, Candia, Cagli, Cesena, Cazioni, Cesena Grande, Cesena Signoria, Cesena Signoria (Montezote), Cesena, Cazioni, Cesena, Meldolese, Mogliano, Noli, Ori, Provinzi, Scuola, Spezzabanda, Serviera, and Zanotti. In 1736, he was appointed podestà of Bagnoli. In 1738, he was appointed podestà of Cazioni. In 1740, he was appointed podestà of Monza. In 1741, he was elected to the Council of Ten. In 1743, he was appointed podestà of the Venetian Reformat after serving as professor of medicine at the University of Padova from 1731–34. In 1744, he was appointed podestà of the Ducal Court of Sighs, which he held from 1747 until 1755. In 1745 he was elected to the Council of Ten. In 1748, he was appointed podestà of the Venetian Reformat. In 1751, he was elected to the Council of Eight. In 1751, he was elected to the Council of Ten. In 1755, he was elected to the Council of Four. He served on the Council of Ten until 1760, when he was elected to the Commission of Ten. From 1760 to 1763, he was a member of the Viceregio of Venice. In 1761, he served on the Council of Twelve. In 1763, he was elected to the Senate of Venice. In 1765, he was elected to the Council of Ten. In 1767, he was appointed Procuratie Magnar. In 1768, he was appointed Procuratie Venier. In 1770, he was appointed Procuratie of the Republic in exchange for a loan from the Venetian government. He served on the Council of Ten until 1774, when he retired from politics.        
Gavino De Luca was a Venetian Vintner. [SEP]    He was a discoverer and fomentator, who, with the independence of the press from the 'Old Regime', formed the first public pamphleteering society. He was a prolific writer, editor and publisher, and managed to publish four books of public information per year, the most important of which were:  An Address to the Venetian people concerning the causes of the plague,  An Address to the Venetian people concerning the oath  An Oath of fealty and a decree of the Republic of Venice    He was born and died in Venice. He was a pupil of the celebrated Lazzaro Bastiani. He was a member of the Academia degli Incogniti. He was appointed member of the Council of Ten. He was frequently as podestà of different branches of society, and held various offices, as bailo, bailore, bailini and finally bailore of the Castle of Hainaut. He died in Venice in 1702.   
Napoleone Lombardi was a Venetian Engineer. [SEP]    Venetians had employed Lombardi for many years, partly because Venice was a very important factor in the development of the iron ore refine . During Lombardi's time as an engineer, he mainly worked on refining the ore to refine its quality and reducing its weight. Lombardi was not a member of the scientific community, and his small number of publications (three) made him difficult to get a hold of, although a few letters from him have survived.    Lombardi was born in Venice in 1556. He studied mathematics at the University of Padova, and then began working as a wood carver. In 1564, he was in England, where he met W. Leigh, who was an engineer, and they became lovers and married, in 1565, the engineer James Salter. They had two sons, Charles and Nathaniel. Salter and Lombardi had a daughter and son, Charles and Nathaniel, and a son, Charles and Nathaniel. Nathaniel died in England.                    In 1564, Lombardi was in England, where he married professional wood carver, James Salter, and later had the family-owned mines in Holborn and Blackrock. James and his brother Richard had extensive mining and quarrying operations in the Hills of Derwent, Derbyshire, and the Downs and Hants.  James and Richard also had extensive project for building stone walls, fences, and piers at Blackrock and Loch Lagan. In addition to their families' businesses, they had also begun to build a stone quarry in the same area, and had started to use it to make bas-reliefs in the 1560s, which is where James' influence may have begun. In his spare time, James and Richard also had considerable amusement. Richard's sons Charles and Nathaniel built an astronomical observatory in Glasgow.    In 1568, James Salter and his brother Richard (together with David Teniers the dyer) opened a small stone quarry near Loch Lagan, Blackrock, and commenced producing stone for the construction of a chapel and house. Richard and his brother also excavated old mines to refine iron ore. Richard and James excavated a large area around the base of the chapel, and around the sides and pilasters of the house. The whole property was sold in 1594, and then given to the monks at Blackrock. James Salter died in England in 1505, and his widow, Mary, in 1508.           
Temistocle Romano was a Venetian Soapmaker. [SEP]    He was active in early style of scottish baroque Venetian  Venice, and has influence of Paul III and Giorgione in baroque style, as well as of Andrea Mantegna and Francesco Guardi. As a young man, he produced    He was a pupil of Santo Peranda. He married the painter Sante Peranda in 1713.     He has a sister named Cecilia. He was a founding member of the Venetian Academy. Among his pupils were         
Lamberto Romano was a Venetian Politician. [SEP]  He was the son and successor of Giorgio, a wealthy Venetian and Venetian Senate member. He was elected in a very tight election, and lost an election to Giorgio. He was very popular in Venice, and was popular even in his own island of Cyprus, ruled by a descendant of the Archont family. In his time as Doge, he made good progress towards reconciliation with the Papacy, and with the League of Cambrai. He took care to establish a relationship with the old feudal rulers of Italy, and to avoid directly intervening in their internal affairs.  He tried very hard to cultivate a pro-French attitude among the Venetians, and to convince them that France was not at war with Venice, but with the Papacy; but in the end, he could not do this without provoking a nationalist reaction. He tried to incorporate the Papacy in a union with the Holy Roman Empire, but this proved very difficult. He tried to gain favor with the Duke of Burgundy by showing him that Venice was willing to pay tribute to Burgundy, but this proved very difficult, and in the end, the Burgundians rejected his overtures. In the end, he resorted to encouraging the acquisition of territories of the Papacy, by giving the Papal States the rights to certain Papal towns, and promising to send representatives of the Papacy to Venice to discuss the issue. The Papacy was not happy about this, and the negotiations failed.           Bordiga was elected as Doge in a very tight election held on September 23, 1577, the day before the start of the French Revolution. The two main candidates, the incumbent Giorgio Brutus (with whom the Pazzi family still held the majority in the Senate), and the reformist Francesco Bordiga, both entered their terms of settlement uncertain of victory. After some debate, a compromise was reached and Bordiga, with the support of the French ambassador, John Lannan, was elected as Doge on September 25, 1577.  Bordiga was very aware that the French were watching carefully the activities of Venice in the Ionian Islands, especially during the negotiations for the unification with the Papacy; therefore, he tried to play down potential tensions with the French, and played the long game. France was not in a hurry to conclude a treaty at this point, and it was very concerned about any tensions that might arise out of a Franco-Italian alliance. Because of the alliance's strategic importance, the French would come to see it as a key to their future security in the Mediterranean. The alliance would also provide a financial bonanza for the Republic of Venice, which would then be able to buy goods from France at a much lower price. Consequently, the negotiation over the treaty was conducted very carefully, and the terms were kept very simple. The Republic of Venice was paid a generous 10,000 livre, which allowed it to conduct its own independent research and development, while France was given a paltry 1,000 livre. The Republic of Venice was not offered any special privileges, and the alliance was as simple as that: France was given the far-flung fiefs in Crete, and Venice was given the island of Santorini. The Venetians had only a nominal say in the affairs of the island, but many of the haciendas that came to the island were owned by them.    Immediately after assuming office, Bordiga's policy changed. His first move as Doge was to sign a series of treaties with other countries: the Kingdom of Candia was acquired by the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1512–15), and the Republic of Venice was given the post of client state (regime) in the Byzantine court on Santorini (known as the Kingdom of Candia at the time), from where it signed treaties with the following rulers: Alexander the Great (r. 1519–1534), Bailo of Negroponte (r. 1533–1538), King of Hungary (r. 1537–1541), Prince of Achaea (r. 1545–1547), Duke of Candia (r. 1546–1551), Duke of Candia (r. 1547–1551), Duke of Candia (r. 1551–1556), Duke of Candia (r. 1556–1561), Duke of Candia (1561–1563), and finally, the post of Doge (r. 1563–1566).     In 1566, he was involved in the dispute between Venice and the Papacy over the control of Pellestrina. In the interim, he unsuccessfully tried to convince the Duke of Verona to accept French rule. In 1567, he unsuccessfully tried to convince the Duke of Modena to accept
Atenolfo Romano was a Venetian Needleworker. [SEP]   
Vito Mancini was a Venetian Gardener. [SEP]    He was the first to provide convincing experimental evidence for the theory of evolution by natural selection.    He was a follower of the work of the Jesuit scholar, Father Claudio Monteverdi.    He was a poet and librettist.    He was the author of a libretto for an opera by Giovanni Francesco Sacrati, "Der Ebenezer Humiliation", painted in 1592.   
Azeglio Lupo was a Venetian Miner. [SEP]     The name Venier is a corruption of Venier da Canale. It may derive from a number of different Venetian dignitaries: Venier da Canale, Venier di Palma, Venier di Barbarigo, Venier of Benvenuti.    Venier was the son of Francesco Venier, who came to Venice in the 11th century. He was a member of the noble family from Sebenico, and was probably born in the tenth or eleventh century. He had three brothers who were all probably Venetians. His mother probably married a Venetian. During his youth Venier worked as a fisherman. He married and had a family that reached to 100,000 ducats. The family owned land on which they lived.Venier was educated at Padua. He also became a monk and devoted to the study of the patristic writers. In his family's farm near Venice, he worked as a farmer and later as a land administrator. Venier was the member of a council responsible for fisheries and aquaculture. He owned three loggias on the nearby Lagoon of Venice. He was a royalist in the late 11th century. In the early reign of Doge Pietro II'ZIOMI, he was the lord of the islands of Santorini and Thirassia. Between 1090 and 1102, Venier moved to Venice. He held numerous public offices and was a state scribe. The records of the Venetian state library show that he wrote a history of the Doge's Campaign, as well as a number of histories and political biographies. Venier appears to have lived in the early years of the republic in the neighborhood of Venice and signed his name with the name "Vicente" in Latin.    In the early years of the republic, Venetians of Italian descent were rare. As the emperors expanded the empire, they became increasingly important in diplomatic and military negotiations. They remained so for the rest of the history of the republic, and continued to play an important role in political and diplomatic affairs until the end of the republic in 1797. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1570-1573, Italian merchants began to pack Venetian ports and moved to strategically placed colonies in the Indian Ocean. This development was aided and abetted by the favorable tax policies of the Republic. Venetian merchants used the Triangle of Good to trade with the Middle East.    In the mid-14th century, Venetian rulers and their agents began to exploit the lucrative slave trade that existed in the Indian Ocean. The Venetian government, under the leadership of their military commander, Andrea Dandolo, sponsored and armed the Minot war against the Kingdom of Morocco. This war saw the largest and most devastating land assault on the kingdom's southern coast in its history. Venetian ships and naval units, supported by the Portuguese fleet, completely dismantled the sultan's main sea lanes and fortified its major cities. Throughout the Indian Ocean, Venetian settlements continued to expand, fortifying their ports in Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, the Malay Peninsula, and in the British-controlled British Netherlands. The Venetian-Ottoman border soon became heavily militarized, with the Portuguese and Turkish fortifications jutting out from the northern side. This militarization of the area, coupled with the presence of a Turkish naval ship in Negroponte, further militarized the Strait of Otranto. Political tensions between Venice and the Ottoman Empire mounted, as did tensions between Venice and the Catholic Church. In the early years of the republic, Venice and the Papacy had remained neutral, but in 1478 tensions came to a head when Venice, under the leadership of its Cardinal Federico Baldissera Bartolomeo Cornaro, and the Papacy, under the leadership of Cardinal Ignazio Giustiniani, signed a Treaty of Venice. This treaty, which saw the Ottoman Empire ceded four strategically located locations in Europe, ended the Second Scutari War. The Venetian fleet was heavily damaged by the Ottoman siege of Negroponte in 1478, though Venice survived and continued to trade with the empire. In 1481, Pope Alexander VI sent Venice one of the most important diplomatic missions, tasked with resolving disputes between the Papacy and the Byzantine Empire. In this mission, the Venetian Consul in Constantinople, Andrea Cornaro, played a pivotal role in the resolution of disputes between the Byzantine Emperor and his successors.      The first important event in Venetian maritime history occurred in 1471, when the last remaining Greek warship, the Nike of Saint Nicolas, set sail from Constantinople to the glorious Venetian city of Como. The Venetians had been at war with the Byzantine Empire for more than four decades, and the victory of
Gioacchino Mancini was a Venetian Grave Digger. [SEP]    Mancini was born in Venice, in the parish of San Moisè. He was a member of the noble family of the Scuola Grande of Venice from 1762 until at least 1775, when he was elected as parish priest at the high altar of the Church of the Scalzi in Venice. From 1775 to 1779, he was the abbot of the Monastery of Saint Sergius in Croatia, where he led a monastic life until his death. He was active in the life of the community, for which he was awarded a knighthood. In his will, he directed the establishment of a monastery near Pordenone, where the Scuola Grande still flourished, and where he was to establish a school for the study of the ancient ancient languages, thus becoming the founder of the school of monastic medicine in Northern Italy. In his youth, he attended the Cluny Academy, founded by a Venetian nobleman in 1728, and acquired a doctorate in medicine from the University of Padova in 1744. He became a professor in Padua in 1746, and was elected as Bishop of Brescia in 1748.    In 1736, he travelled to Rome with a group of adventurers, and settled in Venice, where he was elected as professor of medicine to the Academy of Medici. He became the first to propose the establishment of a hospital in the city.     In 1751, he was appointed the official physician to the Venetian delegation to the Congress of Paris, and received, in 1763, the most important post of the Venetian delegation at the same Congress. He was also the first to declare that the annual income of the Republic of Venice amounted to 1500 ducats.    In 1776, he was appointed the official physician to the Venetian delegation to the Congress of Vienna, and received, in 1778, the most important post of the Venetian delegation at the same Congress. While he continued to be the Venetian's top official medical adviser, he also played a very important role in the creation of the Vienna Consiglio della Bambino, a cabinet-making body composed of important heads of state, which was crucial for the development of the Austrian state.     While he was in Vienna, he visited Bologna and played a role in the first symposium on the history of music, with an exhibition held in the Gothic cathedral of Chiesa in 1780. In 1782, he was appointed the first Italian member of the Great Council. In 1783, he was elected as professor of music at the University of Parma, and received, in 1787, the most important post of the Venetian delegation at the same Congress. He stayed with the University of Parma for 51 years, retiring in 1819, at the end of his term. He was succeeded by his son Marino.     In the same year of his stay in Italy, he was named professor of music at the University of Vienna. In 1808, he was elected as Chancellor of Venetian Academy, and was succeeded by Francesco Cornaro. In the same year of his stay in Vienna, he married Giustina Morosini, daughter of the violinist Ludovico Morosini, and she bore him three children: Michele, Juliet and Lorenzo.       In 1811, he was appointed as member of the Commission on the Establishment of the Academia Universitaria of Bologna. In this capacity, he played an important role in the reorganization of the Roman Academy, which had been in a state of flux for some time. In the intervening period, he had the following interests:    trade in Venice, with an annual turnover of about 5000 ducats, a further 7000 ducats of which were expended in maintaining the present Academy, with three branches, of which he was Chancellor; construction of the first university campus in the world (Udine University, now the Max Planck Institute for Medical Informatics in Berlin) for music, with the second one (the Lucca campus) for mathematics; the creation of a new, larger court for the reception of dignitaries and officials of the Venetian Republic and its imitators; and the appointment as Chancellor of the Venetian Academy of Cornelis de Bruijn, with the title of Lucca de' Cicognini, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and International Relations.He was a major patron of Paul III, who gave the basilica in 1808 to St. Peter for the building of the Shrine of the Apostles, and of the present Academy of San Marco for St. Matthew and the Gift of the Magi.                 
Marcantonio Giordano was a Venetian Waterman. [SEP]    Giordano was born in Venice in 1543, to a noble family associated with the patriciate of Venetian banking. He was educated at Padua, where the University of Padova had been established from 1548. Giordano entered into banking relationships with foreign countries, which soon became important in Europe. In Venice, Giordano became acquainted with the Bank of Amsterdam, the Bank of England, and with the Bank of France. In May 1554, he became a member of the Bank of Bailo of Venice, the next step in the evolution of the Venetian banking system. On 15 June 1556, he took part in the first of many depositions of the Pope, during which the Venetian government asked him to declare whether he was a heretic or not. In a letter to the Venetian Senate, Giordano stated that he was not a heretic, but rather of a Protestant belief, which caused the Senate to issue a general prohibition against banks that did business with him. In July 1557, Giordano took part in the Bank of Bailo of Bologna, the first branch of the Bank of Venice. In 1560, the Venetian Senate authorized him to accept deposits from foreign countries at a rate of 3 per cent. He later joined the ownership of the Bank of Bologna, which was later called the Bank of Venice. Giordano was the first to introduce the "double bill" (debts and profits from the sale of the same business) which served as a reserve against default by lenders. He was also the first to introduce the "aggregate bill" which was used by subsequent Venetian bank presidents to justify the large loans they took out. Giordano used the "aggregate bill" method to finance the Bank of Venice, which operated as a single bank, with no branches or proprietary trading. As the first bank to issue its own currency, the "Venetian Lira", it followed suit later issued its own series of silver coins known as the Silver Spur, which were very popular and quickly became popular as well. In addition to its silver coins, it issued three types of gold coin: The more commonly issued The Metropolitan, the Saint, and the Prado. The Prado was a half-dollar symbolizing the quality and quantity of silver employed in the supply of the Republic of Venice. It was issued in 1559, when the coin was valued at around 30 cents. The Metropolitan was the first to introduce the metric system to the coin. It was followed by subsequent coins in the Metamorphoses, Liberty, and by the Venier, which used the metric system exclusively and had only later adjusted its system to incorporate some elements of the Italian system. The Venier was the first to introduce the obverse side of its coin featuring the goddess Marina. It was followed by subsequent coins in the series that would describe the patron deity of the coin, with the most well-known being Good fortune.    All Venier silver coins were struck from .9999 fine silver alloy, weighing 0.1 gram and having a sidesubmarine gauge of 41.5 mm. They were all dated in 1559 or earlier, which is older than most Venetian silver coins and earlier than most other European nations. The reason for this is that the Venier coins were all struck from .9999 fine silver and had the same dimensions, although some were struck from .9999 finer silver, which gave them a polished look. The obverse side of the Venier silver coins featured the goddess Marina surrounded by four images: St. Mark confronting the Angel of Death, Judas Iscariot, Moses and Elijah, and Athena with a Child. The reverse side featured the goddess Leda, Nyssa, Apollo and Aurora in a semicircle and St. John at an angle.         The Venier silver coins were popular and quickly became popular. The Metamorphoses were struck from a mixture of .999 fine and .9999 fine silver, with a side mass of about .5 grams. The denomination was named after the Venier family, which was responsible for the minting of the coins. The denominations were: Venier Silver, issued from 1559 to 1599, denomination code (VC) 5. Venier Silver, commemorative coin (US$) 606, denomination code (USD) 5. The coins had different designs and shades of silver, as shown in the gallery of images below.     The Venice Silver Concord was struck on 3 January 1559 by Bailo Michele of Corfu, who signed it "Vici et Dimini M. Conte F. (Venice, 20 September 1559 - Venice, 22 February 1622), 'Luciano' (for 'Master'),' et al.' (for 'Andromeda'), and 'B
Guarino Rizzo was a Venetian Scribe. [SEP]    He was born in Venice and probably studied mathematics with the mathematician Marcantonio Memmothe. He began writing in Latin at Padua and later moved to Venice, where he met the scribe Scaliger and his contemporary, Alessandro Amigoni. Amigoni was also a scribe and wrote two manuscripts in Venice. He began to work on his magnum in 1519, and finished it in 1525. He recorded the names of the principal mathematicians and formulated the equations for the principal works of the great master. He was the possessor of a very fine library in Venice. Amigoni dedicated his magnum in 1526 to Francesco Sforza, the Republic's first official scribe, and his wife, Marchesina, the daughter of Doge Francesco Sforza. He included a dedication to Andrea Ghisi.     He was elected doge of Venice in 1529, and immediately began to reorganize the city's information system. The internal reforms instituted by his predecessor, Andrea Contrario, had led to some administrative complications. The new administration sought to minimize conflicts between multiple departments, and to simplify the system for transmitting information to the various branches of the government. The new management also sought to improve the functioning of the courts, by reorganizing the administration of justice and administrative affairs. Amigoni did not want to part with the offices that directly addressed his needs, so he engaged a courtier from Bologna, Giuseppe Foscarini, to serve as the Republic's first official administrator of the Venetian legal system.In 1531, he was elected as captain general of the Republic in one of the most important positions, and quickly achieved both. This position was critically important in the development and diffusion of the Venetian legal system, and Foscarini played an important role in this reorganization. He was always ready to assist his fellow commissioners in their work, and the esteem held for him by his peers is probably what led to his appointment as a commission of the commissioners of the Republic. His tenure as captain general lasted until 1535, although some historians have noted that certain important decisions were left to his successor, Marco Cornaro.    During his tenure, Venice became involved in a long dispute with France. In 1535, Pope Paul V sent Foscarini a letter of approbation. In 1539, Venice and France concluded a treaty allowing for free passage of Venetian merchants in France. This was a significant development for the Venetian economy, as shipping lanes between the two continents had been blocked for many years. The port of Chios was then granted a special trading status, and in 1544, Venice sought to gain entry into the Greek Empire through Greek islands. In 1546, the Republic issued a treaty allowing for transit of Venetian merchants and passengers through Chios and Argos, and through Negroponte and Argos in 1547. This was a precursor to the negotiations that resulted in the Treaty of Concepción of 1553, and the various agreements that followed. In 1551, Venice was renamed a city on the list of the republic's founding fathers.In 1555, he married the recently widowed Ippolito Lombardo, and had a son, Giacomo I Ippolito, that was named Ippolito by his father, and later became known as Giacomo II.    In 1561, he was appointed commander of the Venetian naval base at Candia. This base was established in 1567, and had as its purpose the construction of a large wall along the entire Adriatic coast to prevent Venetians from invading the lands of the Byzantine Empire. The Venetian naval base there was later renamed Modon and later called Corfu.The Venetian fleet then set sail for the decisive battles of Lepanto and La Pallade. The Venetian victory at Lepanto forced the Ottoman Empire to agree to a peace treaty in 1571, and the Venetians secured a naval base at Candia for the next sixty years. During his tenure, the Venetian fleet constructed great gates on the Greek island of Milos and stormed Ottoman fortress Karytaina.     In 1577, Foscarini was created by the new Byzantine emperor, Andrew III, as commander of the Venetian fleet at Constantinople. This position was crucial in the development of the navy of the Byzantine Empire. Andrew III needed a fleet commander in the Mediterranean, and Venice was able to supply him with many warships. Andrew III commissioned Foscarini to plan the construction of a fleet to defend the Byzantine Empire, and he supervised the construction of the fleet. The Venetians completed the construction of the fleet in 1596, during the Siege of Constantinople, and ordered ships from Candia, Candia, Candia,
Adriano Lombardi was a Venetian Artist. [SEP]    He was born in Venice, the son of the influential Venetian artist Pietro Lombardi. Antonio Lombardi was one of the founders of the Venetian Academy. He is notable for his  tragic, yet enchanting, allegorical paintings depicting scenes from the life of Christ.     Lombardi first studied at the Brera in Milan, where he was a member of the  Academy of painters from 1590-1614. From 1614 to 1616, the Venetian Academy was organized around two main academies, the Neoclassical Academy in Milan and the Rococo Academy in Venice. As a result, he mainly painted scenes with figures and architecture of Venice. However, he has also been known to have worked in the countryside of Dalmatia and in Dalmatia. Lombardi also painted frescoes in  Imperial Rome, including for the patronied come January 1618 and for the Hermitage in 1623-24.He is known for his  rambunctious  and whimsical  paintings    He is also remembered for his  whimsical  paintings     He was inspired by Giovanni Bellini,  and commissioned many of his own  figures from Bellini.     He is the inventor of the camera obscura, a device for taking pictures with little or no illumination.    He is known for his opera and comic books. He published comedies and  rompers for two or three  pageants a year.      Lombardi translated several works of Bellini, including his Noctes della calice (The Comedy of Errors),  his six rhetoricians, and  his Noctes della calice il calice (The Comedy of Calculation).     Lombardi was also influenced  by  Giovanni Bellini's work in the Orient.    He trained in Verona under Bartolomeo Montagna, and then to Jacopo da Bologna, the founder of the Venetian Academy, and then to Alfonso Costa,  the native of Mantua.    In 1626, he traveled to Florence, where he accepted an appointment to the court of Duke Alfonso II d'Este. There, he painted a  group portrait of Duke Alfonso II and his wife, Elisabetta d'Este, with music by Francesco Hayez. In 1629, he was  employed at the court of Prince Philip the Portuguese,  where he painted a Madonna della calice and a Madonna della calice il che'l cor è da regola.    In 1634, he returned to Venice, to work  on the Grand Canal. Here, he painted for the Marquis Savoy, Grand Vizier, Antonio Faldoni, and later the Dukes of Mantua,  a Madonna with St Laurence for the main altar of the Palazzo Dolfin Manin (1645–1676), and a Madonna della calice il che'l cor è da regola (1651–1668) for the Palazzo Molino.

He painted a Madonna with Sts. Sebastian, Vincent Ferrer, and Francesco Guardi for a church in Brescia (1644) and a Madonna for the grounds of the Uffizi in Florence (1655).   
Simone Lupo was a Venetian Waterman. [SEP]    In a discovery that is today regarded as extraordinary, it has been found possible that the nautical terms used in the ancient Greek and Roman literatures were coined by the same authors, and that the term "wetland", originally used for the dry continent, was only an adaptation of terms used in the ancient Greek literature. In other words, the terms "wetland" and "ocean" were only  later additions which, taken together, describe the basic geography of the region. Since the discovery is based on a careful analysis of ancient Greek sources with careful attention to their orthogonal and parallel axes, there has been much debate as to whether the terms "wetland" and "ocean" actually existed in ancient Greek.    The discovery of the possible existence of a fourth planet has led to speculation as to the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).    The name Venetians are commonly given as Vettini or Vesini (Vietnamese:    or Vettin), although others have proposed names such as Caesar Augustus, Caesar Demetrio or Caesar Domnius. The common origin of the members of the family Vettin and their common descent has led to speculation as to their ethnic origin.    The Vettin family occupied the islands of Santorini and Syra in the Baffin archipelago by the mid-19th century, and settled in the Greek island of Santorini around the mid-19th century.From a purely biological point of view, the family appears to have originated on the island of Euboea, and continued to grow throughout its history, eventually settling in its present location in the Greek island of Santorini. Vettini's branches and other fiefs spread throughout the region, and eventually reached the ends of the island.    Until the mid-19th century, the family operated a fief called Kavli in the Greek Cyrene, partly owned by Greek Cypriots. In the 19th century, the island was re-named Syra, and Kavli became part of the Greek Cyrene. After the establishment of the Greek Cyrene Fief in the late 19th century, the family operated other fiefs on the islands of Santorini and Syra.    The family moved to their present location in the Greek Cyrene in 1874, and started producing fiefs around 1878, when the last Kavli resident was James William Kavli, and the last one of the Kavli family estates. The Kavli family fief was declared extinct in 1882, and its last inhabitant was Frederick William Kavli.    The family fief on the Greek island of Santorini was called Kavli, partly owned by Greek Cypriots. The name Venetians is usually given as Venetian, although other names have also been suggested.     The family operated two large fiefs on the island of Santorini. Kavli was the main fief of the Kavli family, and had two fiefs: (1) Kavli Papyrus (today the Papyrus Children's Museum in Athens, Greece; (2) Kavli fasces in Syra, off the coast of central Albania).     The fasces in Syra, were owned by the Syra council, and guarded by a number of fair-skinned armed syra. The fasces were manned by syra men, and the kornei were the overlords of the island.     The family owned large estates on the island of Santorini, which produced a large number of Venetian and other admirals. The Kavli family owned large estates on the island of Santorini, which produced a large number of Venetian and other admirals.

Greco Conti was a Venetian Coppersmith. [SEP]    The name of the composer is not known, but he is known for his prints and   segments for two of the operas he composed at Venice between 1572 and 1583. His son, Gaspare Conti, composed a number of Overtures for the same theme, and his daughter, Marietta Conti, wrote a number of Overtures for the same theme.    Gaspare Conti (ca. 1560-1626), was a Venetian artist of the late-Baroque era. Born probably in Venice, he trained in Bologna under Domenico Conti, a very fine young Venetian artist. His first patron was the nobleman and aristocrat Filippo Mocenigo, who bought five prints from his late father. He collaborated with his father on a number of important paintings, which were then sold in Venice and elsewhere. His influence on the Venetian painters is obvious; Andrea Mantegna, Marco Ricci, Marello Rustico, Lazzaro Bastiani, Giandomenina Crivelli, and many later painters are said to have borrowed ideas from his style. He died in Venice, but his works are to be found in  several museums in Italy, Austria, and Germany, including the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Berlin, the Villa Museums Anna Schulenburg in Stuttgart, the Hinwilz Hall of Art in Munich, the Steinhilz Hall of Art in Dresden, the Palazzo Mastini-Russo in Modena, and the Palazzo Conti in Venice.   
Cirillo Esposito was a Venetian Charcoal Burner. [SEP]        His father, Giovanni di Lorenzo Cirillo, was a highly regarded Venetian engineer. His mother, Chiara Pisani, was from the powerful Pisani family, and had a number of other members of the family, such as Giovanni's brother, Andrea Pisani. After graduating from the University of Padova with a degree in civil and environmental engineering in 1711, Cirillo entered the navy as a privateer, and gained experience as a commander in the Mediterranean. He then served as the commander of a sailing ship called Providence, and later as the commander of a frigate called Providence Defensor. In 1714, he married his first wife, Marchesina Morosini, daughter of Francesco Morosini, a Venetian official. After he was married, he entered the navy as a brigand of fustas. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Vicenza in 1715, when he was one of three ships commanded by him to repulse a British attempt to seize the island. He then distinguished himself in numerous other battles off Istria, Brescia, Modon and even Crete, along with victories in the more minor naval conflicts of Malta. In 1717, he was at the height of Venice's commercial fleet, and was so renowned for his excellence that the crew of the galleys of the flagship of the flagship of the Venetian warship Providence nicknamed him "Admiral Cirillo". The nickname stuck, and he was nicknamed "Admiral Pisani" (Admiral Pisani, Vizio, etc.)    In 1719, the war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire seemed to have reached its zenith, as Venice was able to capture Baglioni from the Ottoman Empire. In 1720, he became the commander of a squadron of light frigate Providence, which had been specially created by the new Treaty of Passarowitz to deal with the incursions of the Turkish war fleet into its territorial waters. In 1722, he had joined the zonati, the war galleys of the Republic, which remained in Venetian territories until 1727. In his position as zonati galleys, Pisani was empowered to levy taxes on the Ottoman Empire. Pisani used this power to maintain a naval blockade of the Aegean Sea from 1722 to 1723, which was more restrictive than the Barbary coast, which was a Venetian possession. Pisani also tried to persuade the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, to ally with Venice against the Ottoman Empire.    In 1724, Pisani was elected as a member of the Council of Ten, which was the most important political position in Venice. In this position, Pisani played an important role in negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In 1725, Pisani sent the commissioners of the Atlantic fleet under the command of Mahmud Pasha to Passo e Chiave, off the coast of Crete, to join the fight against the Ottoman Empire.In 1726, Pisani was elected as one of the envoys to the Senate of Venice. In this position, Pisani played an important role in the negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In the Treaty of Passarowitz, Pisani played an ambassadorial role in the negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire.    In 1729, Pisani became the Venetian ambassador to the Ottoman court. In this position, Pisani played an important role in the negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In the Treaty of Passarowitz, Pisani played an ambassadorial role in the negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire.    In 1730, Pisani became the provveditore generale da Mar of Venetian Dalmatia, another important position in the Venetian realm. In this role, he was able to negotiate the surrender of Venetian Dalmatia to the Ottoman Empire in 1736, and to negotiate the restoration and re-union with Serbia of the territories occupied by Venice between 1519 and 1740. Pisani arrived in Venice in 1737 as the Venetian ambassador to the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II; he remained there until 1739, when he was elected as the Doge of Venice. In this role, Pisani played an important role in the negotiations between Mehmed II and the Grand Turkish Empire in 1739–1742, and in the renewal of the treaties concluded in 1742.     In 1734, Pisani became the provveditore generale da Mar of Venetian Dalmatia, another important position in the Venetian realm.

In 1718, he took a position as a teacher at the University of Florence. On 2 July 1719, he accepted an appointment as a lecturer at the University of Padua, where he taught mathematics to Francesco Foscari, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, and Antonio Sdzinski.

In medieval sources he is styled as "Jacopin Dargeli". He appears to have been educated by the local Venetian academy, the  Pontificio Venetici  (1415–1516), and had at least a bachelor's degree in philosophy and epistemology.    He was the first to ask rhetorically whether God was created in the  Second Vatican Council, a debate that lasted more than two hours and resulted in the famous paradox of the superiority of the dogmatic or fide over the practical or practical sciences.  He is noted for his ability to refute various dogmatic points of the Dominican theologian Bernardino Grillo, whose position he later also took.  He had a long-term relationship with the legendary Italian Cardinal Baldassare Cossa, whom he married and which gave him the opportunity to study theology more closely, as well as to work on the development of his own pastoral theology.  The influence of this figure can be seen in his later style, including in the setting of hiss writings of the complex dogmatic theology of the Italian Dominican Church, a subject for later development.  His writings also reflect the influence of the writings of Giovanni Dolfin, the earlier theologian into gnosticism, the more strongly iconoclastical the better.    He was active in the Italian and the regional churches during the Renaissance. In the late 15th century, he and his followers of the traditional Aristotelian Christian theology were active in the Reformation, particularly in Germany.     He died in Venice.

For his own part, Mantegna produced numerous illuminated manuscripts, with titles such as Santo Domini Lamentatura,  Lamentation on the  Destruction  of the  Temple of Solomon   and  La fanti nobili  (The Martyrdom of Solomon, liturgical text, liturgical text, and   title, with  illustrations).

Costantino Ferrari was a Venetian Politician. [SEP]    The son of the influential Venetian family of the Ferrari, Inc., he was a member of the Venetian College of Bishops. He was the brother of Domenico Ferrari, who was a Cardinal. The family of the founder of the family owned the most important property on the Brixen peninsula, which at that time housed the remains of many famous Renaissance artists, including Michelangelo, the father of Gregorio Ferrari, the master of the workshop of Hieronymus Bosch, and the founder of the Fine Arts Academy of Mantua, the same year as Domenico. He was a member of the powerful Council of Ten in the late 13th century and held several high office positions including Bailo of Navigajaro, bailo of Bergamo, bailo of Bologna, bailo of Parma, and bailo of Urbino. He was Chancellor to the Doge of Venice from 1224 to 1230. In his many subsequent posts he was bailo of numerous other states. During his tenure as bailo of Venice, he oversaw a dramatic expansion of the Venetian navy, which had been a distant memory in the history of the republic. In 1282 he was bailo of Ferrara, who at that time were stationed at Parma, Udine, Bologna, and Memmo. In his role as bailo of Bologna, he secured important commercial agreements with the states of the Venetian Archipelago. In particular, he concluded a complex commercial agreement with the Byzantine emperor Basil II for the construction of a new fortress at Dalmatia called Byzantium. In 1283 he was bailedo of Piacenza, who at that time were stationed at Chiron, Piacenza. He led a major Venetian crusade against the Byzantine Empire in 1281. During his tenure as bailo of Piacenza, he oversaw a significant expansion of the university system at Padua. In 1283, Venice was admitted to the  Collegio Romano, a prestigious academic setting. The university system at Padua was one of the most important intellectual environments of the time.    During his tenure as bailo of Piacenza, Domenico Ferrari strengthened the ties with Rome through a complex marriage of the patrician republic with the Byzantine Empire. Between 1282 and 1283 he was Chancellor to the Doge of Venice. In this capacity he coordinated the relations between the Florence Renaissance and the Byzantine Emperors, who also lived near Piacenza. Florence and Byzantium were considered rival cultural centers, so the alliances were often made with them. Domenico Ferrari worked to further the unity of the Venetian church and monastic communities. This was accomplished through various policies, such as the creation of the Venetian Inquisition, the creation of the Patriarchate of Aquilea, the reformation of the ecclesiastical laws and the creation of the Camaldolese order. In 1293 he was created bailo of Ferrara. In this capacity he oversaw the construction of the new basilica of St. Peter on the island of Murano. The basilica had been commissioned by Ferrarese architect Paolo Lazzari. The basilica had been partially completed by 1292 and was ready for the beginning of the Second Atonement in 1295. The basilica was an important element in the relations between the Byzantine Empire and the Vatican, as it housed the remains of the church of St. George and the church of Saint Mark. The emperor transferred the burial place of Christ to this church.Domenico Ferrari died in 1297.   
Silvestro Gallo was a Venetian Storyteller. [SEP]    He was a librettist and masquerades as a clown in order to trick the people of Venice into believing he is actually a librettist. He also changes his appearance depending on the mood of the moment. His libretti are humorous in nature, and often have a dramatic structure, so that the audience is left with the feeling that the author is actually amused. He is considered to be one of the three great storytellers of Venice, alongside Francesco Mosconi and Giovanni Francesco Bembo.    He died at Venice in  1703.   
Adamo De Luca was a Venetian Servant. [SEP]    He was born in Venice, the son of Giovanna Morlaiter and her husband, the Captain general of the Sea Francesco Morlaiter. He served as a soldier in the wars of the Bourbons and the Papacy, and participated in the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Piacenza. In 1694, he was appointed governor of Venice, and held that office until 1702, when he was elected as doge. He was a puppet of the Republic of Venice, and was never able to exercise complete control over his local affairs, which was a cause of much dispute between Venice and the Papacy. The dispute was resolved in 1715 by the intervention of the Duke of Mantua, who was a Venetian vassal. In the Treaty of Piacenza, the Papacy was excluded from Venetian territory, and De Luca was forced to sign a treaty with the Republic to avoid this forfeiture.In 1697, he was invited by the King of England to attend the coronation of King Charles I of England. At the coronation, De Luca pretended to be the legitimate vicar of Venice, and was received by the King as such. At the time of his attendance, De Luca was the official representative of the Venetians in England. In his role as vicar, De Luca was responsible for the proceedings of the English Barons, who had been given a quasi-independence by the English Common Law. The English had exercised absolute sovereignty over Venetian territory for centuries, and the Venetians had only nominal sovereignty, which allowed them to pass laws as they wished, but did not allow them to directly ordain bishops or rulers.The coronation took place during the carnival, which was celebrated as the feast of the Assumption. Many Venetian nobles, including some who had invested their families in the Plantagenet family, were present, including the Prince of Brixen, the Cretan War (1645–49), and the Papal candidate for the doge office of provveditore.           During the reign of John II, he was the most influential Venetian figure of the late 16th century.    On 14 March 1611, the Papacy was declared neutral in the ongoing Spanish-Italian War, which was being waged by the Spanish Republic and the Papal States against the Byzantine Empire. The papal declaration of war, signed in 1611, provided the Spanish Empire with a legal justification to wage war against Venice, which was accepted by the Spanish. The Papal Republic had been created in the twelfth century in response to the Spanish Empire's expansion in the Iberian peninsula. Its creation was preceded by attempts to create a Catholic state in Venice, which failed due to the opposition of Venice. From 1648 to 1690, the Republic of Venice played an active role in the military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, which lasted from the 14th century to the early 16th century. In the papal bull of 1644, the Republic was given overarching political and military responsibility for the management of the papal States, which included Lombardy, Friuli, Merano, Crete, and Bergamo. Venice was also designated as a neutral party, and its role was simplified as it was no longer obligated to fight against the Papal States, which was the preferred option of most Venetians, who preferred to remain neutral. In the mid-17th century, the relationship between Venice and the Papacy began to change in the form of diplomatic missions and official positions. In the papal bull of 1715, Papal States were recognized as a form of Venetian jurisdiction, and the political alliance between Venice and the Papacy was cemented. In the same bull, the Papacy was given the legal right to recognize Venetian priests as priests of the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church, and to grant their offices and recognition. The Papacy played an active role in the negotiations that led to the signing of the Treaty of Passarowitz, which ended the War of Euboeote Succession, and placed Venice in direct control of the League of Cambrai. The Treaty made Venice the legal ruler of the Venetian dominion in the Iberian peninsula.    Pope Clement VII created 31 cardinals in his reign (1638), which was the most number of any pope in the history of the Church. The number of papal candidates increased with the number of papal candidates accepted by the Spanish. In 1694, the number of papal candidates was down to 21. In 1701, it was up to 30. In this period, the number of cardinals increased from 33 to 39. The number of cardinals increased by five to 12 in the course of the 17th century, and the papal bull of 1725, the Apost

In 1590 he was elected as a member of the Council of Ten, and by that means entered the innermostmost sanctum of the Catholic Church. On the death of Pope Julius III, he was elected as Bishop of Brixen, and later as Patriarch of Aquilea, the last position of the Catholic Bishops in Italy.          During the Thirty Years' War, he was a member of the Italian League of Cambrai. During the Seven Years' war, he was a participant of the Papal conclave of 1590-93. During this war he was a participant of the Papal conclave of 1594-96.    On 9 May 1596, during the Papal conclave of 1596, he was elected as Archbishop of Salerno, a position that was later filled by Pietro Beccarelli.    On 19 February 1597, during the Papal conclave of 1597, he was appointed as Bishop of Città Castello, another seat in the valley of Salerno.    On 26 March 1597, during the Papal conclave of 1597, he was elected as Pope Alexander VIII. He was elected as Pope in the first ballot of the Papal conclave of 1597, and was officially declared King of Rome on 19 March 1597.He was the son of a rich Venetian family, who, after a matriculation, became the nobility of Sixtus. He was the nephew of Domenico Sixtus IV, who was also a cardinal.    Alexander VIII had been elected by the popular assembly in March 1597, with 33 of the 40 cardinals voting for him.  Alexander VIII had been crowned and crowned with the title of "King of the Romans" by the newly elected Pope Julius III on 20 March 1597.  Alexander VIII was crowned with the title of "Son of the Roman Emperor" on 26 March 1597.    On 4 April 1597, he was appointed as Bishop of Città Castello, another seat in the valley of Salerno.    On 10 April 1597, he was appointed as Archbishop of Verona, another seat in the valley of Salerno.   
Piergiorgio Regio was a Venetian Weaver. [SEP]    He was born in Venice and was educated at the School of Orazio. He spent some time in Germany and France. He was in England by 1774. He was in England by 1796. He was in Germany by 1797. He was once again in England by 1812. He was in England by 1813. In 1814, he was in Scotland. In 1815, he was in France. He was in France by 1817. He was in Spain again in 1821. He was in England by 1827. He was in Spain again in 1828. He was in Italy by 1829. He was in Venice by 1832. He was in Italy by 1833. He was in England by 1837. He was in Scotland by 1838. He was in Scotland by 1839. He was in Italy by 1841. He was in England by 1844. He was in Italy by 1847. He was in Germany by 1849. He was in Germany by 1851. He was in Italy by 1854. In 1856, he was in England. He was in Germany by 1859. He returned to Spain in 1867.     He is also known as   Pardo de la Fornarina, Pardo dal Pardo, or La Fornarina. The Spanish translation of his name is unknown, although several variations of the name are known. He was the father of Andriasio Pardo.     Pardo was a noted artist and an important member of the Venetian painters guild. He was well known for his portraits and his silks, which were often embroidered with text with his portrait. His style developed a following associated with him as an influential stylist. Pardo's silk paintings are characterized by vigorous brushwork, with cool, almost silky, hues. His embroidery, on the other hand, is more colorful and dynamic, incorporating many patterns. It is a style rooted in the Neoclassicism, and its influence can be detected in the vibrant colors and textures of his silk paintings. His engravings are characterized by elegant presentation, but sophisticated composition.     Pardo was born in Venice in 1554; he had been an international student of the great masters Bernardo Strozzi and Giovanni Antonio Fasolo. He soon opened his own studio, which was soon followed by engravings and which became the inspiration for his silks, portraits and silk dresses. His first international clients were from England. He was to work on silks for many years after this period. Pardo was to influence the fashion in a number of ways. First, he was to influence the silk industry in Italy, which had been in a state of flux following Giovanni Suetonius' panic-spread panic-dressing of silkworms in Venice in 1551. The  development of the silkworm in the late 1550s was influenced by Pardo's work. Secondly, Pardo was to influence the fashion in England, which had been in a state of flux following Giovanni Suetonius' panic-spread panic-dressing of silkworms in 1551. The ostentatious opulence and materialism of the aristocratic class of clients soon led to a decline in clientele. The more lavishly decorated the shop, the more expensive the work, and the more directly the clientele were influenced by Pardo's style.    Pardo was to influence a variety of later masters, including Francesco Guardi, Pietro della Vecchia, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, and Ludovico Ariosto. Pardo was to influence Filippo Negri.       Pardo's influence over the English court can be traced in the gowns and silks he produced while employed as a court painter in the Venetian Republic in the 1590s. The Kensington gown, now in the British Museum, was produced by Pardo in 1597 and is particularly notable for its geometric patterns and vivid colors. The silk dress was produced by Pardo and created a few years later. The intricate patterns and brightly colored silk make it one of the most prized pairs of silk dresses in the British Museum. It depicts the Queen seated on an elegant chair with her back to the viewer, with her arms around the shoulder of the man, whose back is turned away from the viewer. The silk dress has been dated to 1594 and is therefore very valuable. The ornate design recalls the pearls of the court of Charles I of England. The silk dress has been dated to 1597 and is therefore extremely valuable. The gold leaf in the brocade has been dated to 1594 and is therefore even more so. The pearls themselves were purchased from the British Museum.      In the silk dress, the Queen is depicted as a robust and commanding woman
Giordano Ferrari was a Venetian Mercer. [SEP]     The family of the Venetian nobility was of humble origins, originating from Venice. The son of Giovanni Dolfin and Bianca Morosini, they had three branches:  the Dolfin family, which ruled the Venetian-held islands of Tirreno, Spalato and Corfu; the Morosini family, which ruled the Venetian-held islands of Spalato, Coloni and Crete; and the Badoer family, which ruled the Venetian-held islands of Negroponte and Corfu. Their three dukes were Giordano Dolfin, Federico Dolfin, and Francesco Dolfin.    The family held various positions from soldiers to bureaucrats, from judges to admirals to ambassadors. Giordano Dolfin was commander of the Venetian navy from 1587 to 1592. He participated in the Cretan War (1560–1564) against the Ottoman Empire, and was involved in the negotiations between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. He was a participant in the peace negotiation between Venice and the Ottoman Republic in 1570.In 1571, he became a member of the Council of Ten. In 1572, he was appointed as podestà of Bologna. In 1583, he became a member of the Council of Ten. In 1586, he became a member of the Venetian Senate. In 1594, he became a member of the Ten. In this capacity, he supervised the construction of the new Ducal Palace, the Colonna d'Isole, and supervised the acquisition of the land of Palazzo Ducale for the Venetian state. He served also as a member of the Council of Ten.In 1594, he was appointed as Procurator of St Mark's. In this capacity, he oversaw the revision of the calendar, which had been put into effect in the Middle Ages; he recommended the appointment of a new Venetian Pope as a result of a conclave held in 1594; and he negotiated with Ottoman authorities on the exchange of citizens for Turkish prisoners.    In 1597, he was elected Governor of Belluno, followed by the resignation of his predecessor Federico Dolfin on account of his age, that is, on 19 April 1597. In 1598, he was appointed ambassador to Spain. In this capacity, he attempted to improve the relations between Venice and the Byzantine Empire. In this capacity, he met with Joan of Arc, who was a minor Venetian vassal; he also exchanged letters with Philip II of Spain, the son of the Byzantine emperor Alexios III Angelos. In 1599, he was appointed as bailo of Constantinople, and was involved in the administration of the Ottoman Empire. In 1600, he was appointed as bailo of Negroponte and was the guarantor of the cessation of the hostilities between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In this capacity, he negotiated the end of the Siege of Durazzo.    In 1602, he was created bailo of Negroponte. This position was only valid for a short period of time, namely from 16 May 1602 until 27 July 1605. During this period, he was the administrator of the Venetian territories in the Duchy of the Archipelago and in the Venetian colony of Crete. In this capacity, he concluded a treaty with the Republic of Venice on 5 March 1605. He remained as bailo of Negroponte until the end of the war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In 1607, he was appointed bailo of Constantinople and was again the administrator of the Venetian territories in the Duchy of the Archipelago. He remained as bailo of Negroponte until the end of the war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire in 1616. In this capacity, he negotiated the restoration of the island of Euboea to the Venetians on 11 July 1616.     Following the death of the Duke of Negroponte, in 1613, in the Battle of Gallipoli, the Venetian fleet under Giordano Dolfin took over the overall command of the situation in Italy. This development was encouraged by the intervention of the Ottoman fleet under Mahmud Pasha in 1615. In the aftermath of the Battle of Traverset, Dolfin was elected the Doge of Venice. Under Dolfin, Venice employed several Ottoman officers during the more than three decades of Ottoman rule over Negroponte. These included Mehmed the Conqueror (1618–1624), who remains described as "the most exemplary Ottoman war hero of the 16th century" after defeating the combined fleet of Genoese, Venetian and Papal vessels.     Following his predecessor Giovanni Dolfin's death
Costantino Mancini was a Venetian Minstrel. [SEP]    He was born in Venice, belonged to the nobility of the city. He was a seeker after truth, in the service of the republic, and was initiated into the mysteries of the academy of Bologna. In 1597 he was professor of mathematics at the University of Padua, and in 1602, member of the Academy of Genoa. In 1612, he became professor in Padua, and was again appointed professor in 1615, for which time he was awarded a large salary and valuable employments. During the course of his time in Padua, he became acquainted with  the vineyard industry of Padua, and there collaborated in the improvement of the art of vine-garden.    In 1615, he became a chancellor (presidentium generale) of the University of Padua. In 1617, he became a member of the Council of Ten. In 1626, he became a member of the Council of Twelve. In 1630, he became a member of the Audit Council of Rome. In 1634, he became provveditore generale di Nivo. In 1636, he became a member of the Ten. On his election as a member of the Twelve in 1636, he was assigned the position of colonel (sopra) of the Venetian navy, which he accepted with great reluctance.  He was appointed to the post in 1638, and soon received the title of sopra di Terraferma. In 1640, he became a member of the Ten, and soon received the title of Procuratie. In 1642, he became a member of the Ten, and soon participated in the Third Council of the Republic. He participated in the Fourth Council of the Republic, and was elected to the post of provveditore generale di Terraferma, that is, in 1644, sopra di Venezia (superintendent generale da terraferma).    In 1644, he became provveditore generale di Terraferma (superintendent generale di subterranean fortification), which was in turn, in 1647, provveditore generale di Liberta (superintendent generale da subterranean fortification and construction), and finally, sopra di Venetia (superintendent generale da Venezia).  His tenure of each post was for a six-month period, during which he was entitled to accept foreign heads of state.  He resigned his position of sopra di Terraferma in 1646, and was succeeded by his son, Marco.        The Venetian navy was one of the most heavily armed in the world, and its standing in the early modern era was often questioned. Venice had been involved in many wars, and the response of its rulers and navies to the repeated invasions of the Ottoman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire was often tested and sometimes uneasy. In the early modern era, however, the Navy of the Republic was one of the few maritime states that did not directly interact with the Ottoman Empire. This was due to the Ottoman threat and the competing territorial ambitions of the Ottoman Empire and the Venetians, who were keen to maintain good trade ties with both countries. This was also a reason for the relative peace during the early republic. The Ottomans did however, occupy several cities on the Greek coast, and the Venetians, thanks to the proximity of the Greek islands to the Turkish coastline, were able to defend themselves and their colonies on the islands. This was an especially important advantage for Venice, which was mainly located on the southern side of the Aegean Sea from the Black Sea to the Levant. In the early republic, the Republic's military might was further demonstrated by the Byzantine defeats at the Peloponnese and the siege of Constantinople. The Byzantine fleet was also beaten off by the Persian navy under Selassar, and then by the Turkish navy under Vasily I. The conflict was ended after Selassar surrendered, with the latter conquering the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. In the aftermath of the surrender, Selassar was forced to abdicate, and the Venetians, who had been forced to negotiate with the Ottomans, were left to govern the islands themselves. In the end, the Venetian-Ottoman peace was signed in 1644, and the Venetians took possession of Negroponte, the last island of the Venetian dominion.             Marco Gradenigo (1631–1691) was a Venetian nobleman, the last major noble in the Duchy of the Archipelago, from 1684 to his death in 1691. He was the son of Giovanni Gradenigo and his wife, both of whom were Venetian noblewomen. Marco
Nanni Russo was a Venetian Locksmith. [SEP]  He was the inventor of the Geno-Claudio lock, and used it in his own workshops.     While he was a Venetian, he was also an expert in woodworking, and worked at the same time as an artisan, for hire master in Venice and in the more northern regions of Germany.  He has been called upon to pattern the armor for the Duke of Bavaria and the Count Ranucci.  He was also entrusted with the design of the church of Santa Maria dei Servi in Brescia,  and he participated in the building of the church of Santa Maria Nuova of Torcello.  He was the first to apply the famous Palladio pattern to Venetian armor.  The Palladian masonry of the church of Santa Maria Nuova, Venice, was chosen for its robustness and its beauty, but also its effect on the beauty of the building.  The church of Santa Maria Nuova of Torcello, Venice, bears a large Palladian cross on the façade.  The church of San Giorgio in Alga was the first to use this Palladian cross in Renaissance architecture.    The architect Bernardo Palladio, who was to influence many later architects, did not design the church of St. Anthony in Cannaregio.  The Palladian-influenced design was chosen over the simpler, and more contemporary designs by Giovanni Bellini and others.  The church of St. Anthony in Cannaregio, Venice, was designed by Michele Bertinelli,  with Salamonte as the main sculptor.   
Alphons Lastra was a Venetian Wheelwright Wood Carver. [SEP]               Bartholomew is the son of Bartholomew II Lastra and Isabetta Longhena. Bartholomew was born in Kotor and died there in 1685. While still young he worked as a woodcarver. In 1696 he completed a large fresco cycle of wall-paintings, the Esplanade of Kotor, for the Kotor palace. This work was popular in Kotor and spread throughout Europe. In 1704 Bartholomew was commissioned by the Duke of Parma, to paint the facade of the new Palace of the Nobles in Kotor. The complex is a combination of Corinthian, Venetian, Gothic and Renaissance elements with a Neoclassical flavor. Bartholomew designed many of the murals in the complex, which also houses the entrance to the Musée Fabre. Bartholomew did some decoration at the Villa Imperiale near Parma from 1707–1612, and remains one of the artists employed by the Duke of Parma for the entire complex. Bartholomew also designed the decorations at the Villa Imperiale near Parma from 1708–1612, and remained one of the artists employed by the Duke for the entire complex. Bartholomew featured several times in the Kotorrian landscape, including on a Kotorian Castle wall for Jacopo Palazzi and on a Kotorian Forest floorplan for Nerio Borgio.     Bartholomew and his wife, Isabetta, had three daughters and three sons. Four daughters and three sons (Bartholomew II, Bartholomew III, Isabella, Charlotte and Francisco) have been identified.    Bartholomew's children were:  Bartholomew II (1692–1722) married the following woman:   
Luigi Marino was a Venetian Vintner. [SEP]    He was born into a noble family in Venice in 1538, though he may have come from an earlier date. In any event, he was one of the youngest members of the family, and by age 25 he had acquired the leadership of the family. His deep learning and scientific ability, coupled with an almost pathological love of adventure, brought him to the point where he was able to organize, by councils of elders, a national or even a community based education. He was prolific, and his works are in many respects the precursor of the later academies of Venice and Bologna. He was one of the founders of the weekly Biblioteca di Brera, and the editor of Brera's successor, Biblioteca Marciana.In 1566, he took part in the execution of an altarpiece for the church of San Nicolò in Treviso, representing the patron saint of Venice.    In 1567, he took part in the decoration of the Oratorio of Treviso by Francesco Palma il Giovane, representing God and man on a large canvas. The work is an allegory of the Glorious Mysteries, and was inspired by Raphael's 1567 altarpiece of the Madonna with Four Evangelists for the church in Padua. In the left panel, seated in the middle of a tableau is Giustiniana da Camerino, represented by Raphael, and represented by Marino.    In the right panel, seated in the middle of the tableau is Elisabetta del Rosario, represented by Francesco Locatelli, represented by Luigi Marino.     In the left panel, representing God and man on a large canvas, is the Medoro. This work was painted for the church of San Moisè, in the shape of a Liberator. This is written in Latin, and is the first known use of the term "liberator" in a work celebrating the Founder of the Order. The work depicts God as the Medoro, the sea, and man as a family, represented by man. The work was completed in 1568, and was sent to Ricci. It was bought in Milan by Zaccaria in 1576 for the Coimbrai family of Milan, and is now in the Museo Ricci in Florence.     In the left panel is the Madonna della Morte, represented by Francesco Locatelli. In the right panel is a model of the monastery of St. Oswald on the island of Croia, and in the lower right is a model of Palazzo Bembo.    In the upper part of the frame the Virgin and Child with Four Evangelists (1575) is shown in profile, with the right hand supporting the painting. In the lower part of the frame is a model of the monastic community of St. Dominic in Padua, Italy, and in the foreground is a man in a saintly dress, with hands clasped. In the background is a man in a religious dress, with hands folded. In the lower part of the frame, a portrait of Carlo Cornaro, representative of the Venetian family, is shown. In the upper part of the frame is a model of the monastery of St. Oswald on the island of Croia, and in the lower part of the frame a model of Palazzo Bembo.     The large oil on panel painting, The Martyrdom of St. Oswald of Bembo, was commissioned by the late Doge of Venice, in the style of Palma il Giovane. The subject was a ceremony given when the archbishops of Venice delivered the  gift of land to the holy Roman Emperor in the form of a gift of five bishops' wives each, to be distributed among the abbots, cardinals and friars of the Venetian convent of Sant'Ilario in 1551.       
Cesare Mancini was a Venetian Jeweler. [SEP]    He was the son of Silvestro Mancini, a silversmith. Silvestro married Francesco Barbaro, the daughter of Giovanni Battista Barbaro, who was also a Venetian.  Silvestro had two sons, Giacomo and Francesco, who were all killed in the plague.    Mancini's business was failing, so he and his brother Giacomo sold their share of the shop in the beginning of 1531, when the Venetian Council of Ten (Consiglio della Governatore Governatore) confiscated their interests in order to support the faltering Venetian economy.  In 1535, Mancini became the first owner of a share of the new condominium building The Athenaeum, which was inaugurated in 1538. The building was designed by architect Vincenzo Scamozzi and built in the façade of the old Chiesa Palace in Venice with Venetian assistance.      In 1537, Mancini, along with his brother Giacomo, sold their share of the condominium building  The Athenaeum to Francesco Barbaro, the father of Andrea Barbaro.  Giacomo Barbaro died shortly after, and Francesco Barbaro followed shortly thereafter, selling his share of The Athenaeum to the King of France for 380,000 ducats.  On 12 October 1538, Venice was named as one of three European cities vying for Francesco Barbaro's daughter.    Mancini and his brother Giacomo were prominent Venetian patrons.  He married Benedetta Pisani, daughter of the Venetian vine trader and pharmacist Michele Pisani.  In addition to his vine trading activities, he was the Venetian ambassador to Florence, where he served as the city's ambassador to the court of Charles V.  In 1543, he and his brother Giacomo founded the first public company in Venice that specialized in real estate.  The company's main project was constructing the Palazzo Barbarigo on the Grand Canal of Venice. The project was completed in 1546, with the construction beginning in 1552. During the course of his career, he directed the construction of many Venetian public buildings, including the newly completed Ca Rezzonico (1553), the Scuola della Carmini (1554), the Messina (1556), the Bellona (1557), the Scuola della Regina (1561)  and the Via S. Trinità (1563). Giacomo Barbaro died in Venice in 1563.    The Architect of Saint Mark's was one of the main patrons of the sculptor Giacomo Barbaro. In his own lifetime, Barbaro created over 100 statues, which were displayed in five palaces on Grand Canal Street in Venice, as well as at the Villa Grande at Stra. Barbaro's style influenced many sculptors, including Andrea Celesti, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and Francesco Hayez.       
Claudio Lombardi was a Venetian Shoemaker. [SEP]    He was born in Venice and began his journey to Holland at the age of five. He took classes at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and then moved to New York, where he was introduced to the theater by Lasswell, who was an assistant there. In 1811 he won a part in the production of La fanti d'oro at the Teatro La Fenice. In 1813 he was commissioned to represent Parma at the Teatro La Fenice and in 1815 at the Metropolitan Opera House. In 1815 he was commissioned to paint a picture of the Holy Family. In 1816, at the Metropolitan Opera House, he played a part in the production of La fanti d'oro. The following year he was appointed artistic director and head of the studio. He was awarded a Presidential appointment by the Austrian Emperor Joseph I. He was to return to Italy in 1817, but a fall in the Austrian market caused his departure. He returned to Austria in 1819, first to Dresden and then to Munich, where he became artistic director and head of the studio. He was awarded a contract with the Metropolitan Opera House and the Vienna Conservatory in 1821. His works there are mainly silent, and mostly ecclesiastical. In 1824 he was appointed artistic director and head of the studio in Vienna. In 1825 he presented a picture of the Virgin and Infant seated on a platform and with St. John in the background, and was awarded a contract for another picture at the Met. In 1828 he presented a Crucifixion in the Bavarian church of Entwiczen. In 1829 he won a part in the production of Giovanni Francesco Sacrati, and was appointed artistic director and head of the studio in 1831. In 1831 he presented  An allegory of the Marriage of St. Francis in the role of the daughter and son-in-law of Doge Rudolf II, and was awarded a contract with the Teatro San Cassiano in Milan, Milan's most prestigious silent theatre. In 1833 he presented a picture of the Virgin and Infant at the National Gallery of Berlin. In 1835 he presented a Crucifixion in the Gothic cathedral of Modena, followed by a Martyrdom of Saint Dominic in the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Rome, and then the Madonna della Salute in the Borgo isle of Chiron.      In 1837 he married Benedetta Favretto, daughter of the painter Giovanni Eduardo Favretto and resides in Venice,  on a palazzo he inherited from his father. He had three daughters and two sons. All of his children trained under the watchful eye of their father, Giovanni Eduardo. Two of his sons - Francesco and Giovanni Antonio Favretto - entered the vine-growing Zadar in 1839, and later moved to Venice. The Favretto's owned a villa on the La Fenice near Belluno.    Favretto died in 1837, and was buried in the church of San Moisè. He was married to Caterina Lungi, and had three daughters and two sons. Favretto left three daughters and two sons. The children of his first marriage to a Venetian woman - Francesco and Giovanni Antonio - married  Francesca Morosini, and had three sons and two daughters. All of the children of his second marriage to an Italian woman - Francesco and Giovanni Antonio - moved to Venice. The third son, Giacomo Favretto, married Francesco Sforza, and had three daughters and two sons.    The work presented here represents the third stage of my research into the history of architecture in Venice. The subject of the works was the elaborate palace system of Venice, which was developed during the 15th century, as a response to the Italian Renaissance of the late 15th century.       The palace, La Fenice, is a 15th-century complex of four interconnected buildings with a combined age of more than 1,000 years. Originally commissioned in 1531 by Stefano Landi, the complex was finished in 1567 and is considered to be one of the most complex architectural monuments in Venice. The façade of the church of the Gesuiti, completed in 1586, was also influenced by the complex. The church is a typical late-Renaissance configuration with four pews, divided by an alcove. The central altar is the hearth, flanked by cherubim, flanked by octopist and finally by      The complex also includes the Villa S.C. Chiesa, a complex of two huge complex bastions, the Palazzo Falier, Chiesa Falier Ampitheoret for the Venetian Alps, the Villa S.C. Contarini
Federigo Ricci was a Venetian Baker. [SEP]    He was born in Venice, the son of Giovanni Ricci and Emilia Castellini. After a short stint in Bologna, he returned to Venice to focus on his business. One of his first jobs was as a bake master at the famous Osteria di Rialto. In his later years, he worked at various locations of the city's cultural district, including La Fenice, Piazza Il Politini, the Carmini-Palazzi and the now demolished Biblioteca Marcotti. In 1733, he served as a bake master at the grand opening of the new Biblioteca Marcotti. In 1751, he was elected as the first Master of the Bakeri family. His son, Federigo, was a successful merchant and an important political figure in his homeland.    In 1806, Ricci and his brother, Giorgio, opened a new workshop in Venice. The Ricci Fabri-clinic was named in his honor. The Fabri-clinic specialized in ceramics, mosaic, glass and bronze, and was considered one of the best in Europe. Following the death of his brother in 1809, the family sold the business.     In 1811, Ricci helped create the mosaic at the facade of the church of San Teodoro, Venice. In 1813, he helped decorate the palazzo Loredan de Ricci, designed by Paolo Veronese.    In 1814, Ricci was elected as a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. In 1815, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1819, he was one of three art professors at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia.     In 1821, Ricci published the second volume in his series of "Progresses de la vita Italian encyclopedie", which was published simultaneously in four editions in Italy and abroad. The volume included twelve paintings, based on an eclectic collection of works by the Ricci brothers and others, as well as a monumental work, the Fabrazio di Venezia, which attracted the attention of Prince Rosenkreuz. In 1823, Rosenkreuz combined architectural and artistically diverse themes in his monumental scheme, with a more orthodox and conservative rendering in which the figures are monochromatic. The result was a highly original work, which transcended the dichotomy of high art versus low, and was described by one contemporary writer as the "most wonderful sculpture in Europe".     In 1827, Ricci commissioned a large mural fresco to decorate the entrance to the Palazzo Loredan de Ricci-Lazzaro, Venice. The work depicts The Martyrdom of Saint Roch-Loving and the Apostles as a group, with the Saint in the center, representing the Virgin and Child, represented by the Virgin and St Peter, representing the Holy Family, and Roch, represented by the Archangel Michael. The fresco is now part of the Museo Correr.    In 1844, Ricci bought the ceramics studio of Francesco Bembo from Ottoboni, and collaborated with him on another large mural fresco, depicting  Saints Peter and Paul and the Doctors of the Church, now in the church of Santa Maria Nuova, Venice.     In 1851, he was elected a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. In 1854, he exhibited Il Palazzo Romano, now in the Museo Correr, and represented by Abate Loredan. He painted a series of panels for the Villa S.Mercato, Bologna, depicting scenes from life, which were removed from the 1857 illustrated book Les figues de l'estine. In 1859–1860, he painted the main altarpiece of the Villa Pisani at Padua, representing the Life of St Peter. In 1860, he unveiled the altarpiece in the Hall of the Great Council of Venice.    In 1867, he was named an honorary member of the Academy of St. James. He painted a series of panels for the Palazzo Loredan de Ricci-Lazzaro, Venice.    His other major work is the Martyrdom of Saint Roch-Loving in Christ, now in the Hall of the Great Council of Venice. The panels show how Saint Roch, inspired by an image of St Peter supposedly dying for the souls of the damned, had fought against the corrupting influence of the flesh, and then died for the salutary sins of the people. He depicts the martyrdom of St Peter in a manner typical of the imagery of the Renaissance in that he dies for the souls,

Jacopo Romano was a Venetian Pardoner. [SEP]    He was born on the island of Rab, in the far north of Dalmatia, from a Venetian family that produced many more Pardons than Palazzi. He was the son of the noted Venetian painter, Stefano Romano. His brother, Marco Romano also painted. He attended the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice, where he won a prize for painting a Virgin and Saints.    He was active in Venetian painting in the early years of the 18th century, and produced some important works there.    He was a prolific artist, and produced many important paintings in the Venetian school. Among his pupils were Francesco Foscari, Agostino Longhi, Ludovico Lipparini, Paolo Veronese, Pietro Netto, Giacomo Brunetti, and Antonio Molinari.       
Enzio Lastra was a Venetian Dyer. [SEP]    In 1431, he was in Zara, where he was a member of the Dyer's Banda. In July 1432, he moved to Venice, where he worked in the late Bussola's house. In 1433, he married Benedetto. Alessandro was the father of Marco and Filippo.           
Guglielmo Esposito was a Venetian Peddler. [SEP]   
Milo Russo was a Venetian Silversmith. [SEP]  He was the inventor of the silversmithing machine, the silversmithing set up at the Vesey of Venice in 1596.The silversmithing set up was originally called the Fabrizio silversmithing (after Giovanni Battista Fabrizio, who was the first to apply the Fabrizio method to silvers). After it became known that Silversmithing was an official name, it was shortened to Silversmith and given the name Boeckel. He was one of the founders of the Society of Silversmiths of Venice.    Boeckel was born at Padua in Italy. He was the son of Huguesco and Elisabetta Cappello. He was the first of seven children of the silversmith Silversmith, who was honoured by the Doge of Venice with the title of count d'Investigaciè. In Venice, Boeckel studied under the silversmith Bernardo de' Rossi. In 1528, he married the daughter of Giovanni Battista Lombardo. Boeckel began to make jewelry in Venice around 1529, and he worked alongside his sons for the Venetian merchants until 1534. He was the first to apply the Fabrizio method to gemstones. Among his pupils were Francesco Bambini, Pietro d'Alem and Giovanni Adorno. He was the last to apply the Fabrizio method to gemstones.    In 1544, he travelled to Venice, where he was appointed as one of the 13 "Silversmiths of Venice", one of the most prestigious positions in the silversmithing industry. His name is listed in the Guinness book of World records for the last time in the mid 1560s when he applied the Fabrizio method to making jewelry out of gemstones.From there, he moved to Mantua, where he was the last to apply the Fabrizio method to making jewelry out of gemstones. He left his mark on the jewelry industry with the development of the jewelry furnace.    Boeckel was the first to introduce the jewelry furnace to the Venetian jewelry trade in 1596. The furnace was named after him. It was originally a series of small rooms, each housing up to four small jewelry making units, decorated by wood paneling and decorated by the silversmith Boeckel. Each unit had a separate work area and the works were arranged chronologically. The works produced were then assembled and sold privately, with the proceeds going to charity. Some of the works produced included:    Antikythera for the church of Santa Maria Loredan in Venice. Antikythera is a sample of Greek and Roman ancient jewelry. Amuleus and Pallas Athene for the church of Santa Maria della Salute in Venice.    Boeckel left Venice in 1562 for Mantua, where he established the first jewelry workshops of his kind. The first workers were mostly from Venice, although others may have come from other parts of Italy. The workshops worked together in an open system, with no formal hierarchical order and no reason for any particular job. The workers were encouraged to experiment and to specialize in whatever fashion suited them most. This allowed for experimentation to occur and for the products produced to be refined over time. This was a model that would be followed by later jewelry makers, such as Jacques Bellange and Antonio Pollaiuolo.    The first workers were mainly men from Venice, although a few women may have been from other parts of Italy. The employees varied from workers to craftsmen, and from apprentices to full-time employees.    Boeckel worked alongside his sons Gerolamo and Pietro in the Mantuan workshops. This included adding dyes, shades, and polishes to gemstones, as well as working in concert with Giovanni Bellini and his son Giuseppe to apply the Fabrizio method to designs in silk, turquoise, and gold. The company employed about 30 workers in its various stages of production. Boeckel was attracted to ceramics and took apprentices at the court tapas of Giovanni Bellini and his son Giovanni Bellini and His Sons (ca. 1556-1597). These were elaborate weddings where the bride and groom would wear the same piece of jewelry for years. These tapas were costly and included courtesans, courtesans of nobility, jewels, and Greek and Roman sculpture. Some of the pieces included statues, horses, and Egyptian art. The courtesans were particularly important in the Venetian jewelry trade. Boeckel's apprenticeship in Mantua lasted about a year and a half, and he was employed there full-time for the next three years. He returned to Venice when he graduated from the University of Padova in 1602. In Venice he made his first move into the upper

Bartolomeo Marino was a Venetian Playwright. [SEP]    Bartolomeo Marino was born in Venice in 1548. He was the son of Silvestro Marino and Bianca Priuli. He was the first to use the terms noble and vulgar in his Satyricon, a precursor to the Baroque. He was the first to use the term  "Marino", in a speech at the Baccanaluna of Bologna, 1591, in an attempt to distinguish his play from the productions of the noble houses of Italy, the Venetian imperium.He became a famous speaker, and held several public offices, before moving to Madrid in 1589. He was appointed Governor of Madrid in 1593, and was Governor of Venice in 1595-96. In these offices he was the savio del comun, or saviour, of the Spanish Republic, and was the principal author of many laws. In December 1597, he was elected as the first Councilor of the King of Spain, and was appointed the official historian of the Spanish court, until the death of Alberto de Cárdenas in 1598. In 1599, he was appointed the first Governor of the Falier community, and was appointed the principal author of several statutes and judicial decisions. He was Governor of Madrid again from 1605 to 1611.     From 1607 to 1611 he was one of the savi generale del succès locali, or saviour generale da succès l'équité, sopracomito, sopracomito e juristique, sopracomito nel secolo libro. This position was a marked departure from the established policy of the Spanish court.    For a long time, he was in close contact with the king, who was the most powerful man in Europe. In his work  Historia del Medio , Bartolomeo Marino tries to reconcile the conflicting Roman and Catalan interests.  He wanted to establish a modern Spain in northern Italy, but Catalonia wanted to keep the traditional lands in Catalonia with their capital. Bartolomeo struggled for years to get the Spanish court to unite against the Catalan expansion, but finally in 1622 he resigned and moved to Venice, where he was appointed to the lodge in Venice. He had a son, Joseph V, and a daughter, Caterina, that he married to his brother Antonio.    He died in Venice in 1639. His funeral, which was originally scheduled for Saturday, was postponed because of Easter. His friends and scholars from his old life donated funerals, too.     Bartolomeo Marino was the founder of the Accademia degli Incogniti, an academic hospital in Venice.

He was a friend of the artist Francesco Busenello, who painted some reliefs of the Battle of Agnadello.    In 1749, he was appointed as the titular archbishop of Venice. He was the vicar general of the Archdiocese of Venice from 1760 to 1764. The following year, he was appointed as the metropolitan for the year 1751 in the Venetian metropolis of Bergamo. He served as Auxiliary Bishop of Brescia until his death in 1761.     In 1760, he was elected as the Cardinal Bishop of Treviso.  He served as Auxiliary Bishop of Treviso until his death in 1763.    He was the spiritual leader of a group of cardinals who were sent in 1764 to France as part of the plan to restore the Holy Roman Empire.  These same cardinals later came to Rome and were to make numerous trips through the territories of the former Soviet Union and Central America. They were to contribute something to the policy of the restoration of the Roman Empire, something to the restoration of the Clause of Enrico Dandolo. He was to meet with the French ambassador, make several trips to Paris and other cities of the French Republic, confer with the leaders of the Italian Republic, and be their patron in Germany. In addition, he was to receive from the French royal crown the title of count duke of Hainaut.  In order to carry on the work of the French restoration, he was to visit the territories of the former Roman Empire and be its emissary. While in France, he was to negotiate directly with Charles I of England and with the Prince of Orange. The Venetian plan promptly failed, due to the opposition of Charles II and the advice of his counsellors. In England, the French ambassador, the Duke of Chartres, offered to settle all disputes between Charles I and Parliament through arbitration. Under pressure from the Duke of Chartres, Francis I of France intervened and placed the Venetian plan on the same level as the English. The Venetians were forced to recognize the title of the Duke of Chartres and withdrew the plan.    In 1762, he was named administrator of the diocese of Brescia, in Northern Italy. He was then to negotiate directly with Charles III of England and with the Prince of Orange in order to solve the quarrel between Charles III and Parliament. In the event, these negotiations produced no results.    In 1764, he was elected as the Bishop of Verona. In 1765, he was appointed as the Bishop of Brescia. In 1767, he was appointed as the Bishop of Modena. In 1768, he was appointed as the Archbishop of Bologna. In 1769, he was appointed as the Archbishop of Verona. In 1770, he was appointed as the Patriarch of Aquilea. The following year, he was named the Archbishop of Bologna. In this position, he visited Modena and Rome and met with Pope Pius II. The Pope sent him as special envoy to the Congress of Paris. There, he met with Charles IV, the Duke of Orléans, the Knights of Malta and with the Duke of Wittelsbach. In addition, he attended the Congress of Vienna and had informal negotiations with the Emperor Maximilian I. In London, he met with Lord Brooke, who gave him lodgings in the Palace of Westminster. In 1771, he was appointed as the Archbishop of Durham.      In 1775, he
Fabio Lastra was a Venetian Needleworker. [SEP]     He is second only to Giovanni Bellini among Venetian painters of the 16th century. He trained with his father, Luca, a pupil of Gentile Bellini, but was only able to finish a fresco of the Adoration of the Magi in the Villa Bisacco near Venice in 1636; he used an elaborate ornamentation to separate the different figures, the majolica being his most famous work.    He was influenced by Luca Bellini, who was also a painter, and worked alongside him, in the late 16th century and into the early 17th century.     His style in the 19th century was influenced by the Northern Italian School, particularly Lombardism, and influenced by the work of Giacomo Finetti.   
Giuseppe Mancini was a Venetian Shipwright. [SEP]     Marco Polo was born in Venice in 1516 as the son of a rich family. He was the first of six children, and his family was extremely proud of him. He was assigned a noble surname, and nicknamed "Pompeo", because of his poor breeding. His parents were both engravings and engravers. Polo was very interested in architecture, and as a boy he built and decorated small churches and chapels. He was also a bookseller and printed books. His family was always helpful to him, and he spent many years in various stages of study at the Academy of Urbino, and at the Academy of Lazzaro Bastiani. In 1566 he married Elisabetta Contarini, with whom he had three children: Andrea (1571–1594), Aldobrandino (1582–1634), and Giovanni.      In 1580, he was appointed Captain General of the Sea, in the ranks of the distinguished, and very wealthy, members of his family. It was a great honour, and well-known of his family that he was elected as a Colonel of the Republic of Venice, in 1582, during the most important period of his career. He was often absent from Venice, and his position as one of the most important Venetian diplomats was threatened by the rivalries and jealousies of his countrymen. In his retirement at Ferrara, where he had joined the Academy of Urbino, he became an abbot and a Professor of Law, and lived on a pension from the State. In 1586 he decided to retire to Ferrara, and there, in 1592, he founded the Academy of Satyriche Venetiarum, under the leadership of Santo Giustiniani.      In 1602, he entered the service of the Republic of Venice, and fought in the Italian and Spanish wars, on Diego Velasco's side, and in the campaigns of the Spanish Succession. In 1604 he returned to Venice, which he had to do by the end of the year 1606, and was elected as a Senator of the Republic. He was elected as a Doge on January 1, 1608, and immediately began to change the face of the city. He secured a place on the council of the Venetian republic, and soon won the respect of the citizens of the city with his efficient and moderate government. In 1610, he became the first member of the Venetian Academy to receive the title of "Professor of the Republic", which was awarded to him by the Senate.      On the outbreak of the Second Spanish–American War, he was elected as Captain General of the Sea on September 9, 1612, and was personally involved in the decisive moments of the Battle of Lepanto. In the years that followed, he was distinguished by his diplomatic and military knowledge. In 1615 he served as the Commander of the Venetian naval squadron at the Battle of Agnadello, and in 1621, as Commander of the Venetian squadron at Corfu. In 1629 he participated in the victory of the Battle of Greve Ari, and captured the fortress of Treviso. In 1631, he participated in the capture of Cremona. In 1634, he was appointed as commander of the Venetian squadron at the Battle of Preveza. In 1638, he was appointed as Captain General of the Sea. He played an important role in the negotiations during the Siege of Ostend. In 1641, he was elected as Captain General of the Sea. He played an important role in the negotiations during the peace treaty of 1645 between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In 1642, he was appointed as Captain general of the Sea. In 1646 he was appointed as Captain general of the Sea. In 1651 he was appointed as Commander of the Venetian squadron at Sevastopol. In 1654 he was appointed as Captain general of the Sea. In 1656, he was appointed as Commander general of the Venetians. In 1658, he was appointed as Captain general of the Sea. In 1660, he was appointed as Commander general of the Venetians. In 1662, he was appointed as Commander general of the Venetians. In 1664, he was appointed as Captain general of the Venetians. In 1666, he was appointed as Vice-general of the Venetians.        In the beginning of the 16th century, Venice was a major centre for oriental trade. It had established diplomatic relations with the Greek Byzantine Empire, and arranged for its soldiers and diplomats to pass through Venice on their way to the Imperial Throne, in Berlin. The fortress of Treviso had been captured by Ottoman forces in 1607, and the Venetian fleet
Pietro Bruno was a Venetian Basket Weaver. [SEP]    Bruno's family was of humble origins. His father, Guglielmo, was a leatherworker and later became a cabinetmaker. His mother, Anna Matteini, was of humble origins as well, having been the house painter to the Duke of Urbino. His father died in 1508, leaving his brother Antonio and nephew Bartolomeo to support the family. When not working, he was entertained by his mother, who provided them with entertainment and games. After a serious illness, he received a good education from the local church, the Jesuits, and his training was mostly performed by his uncle, Bartolomeo, who also performed several important paintings in the late 15th century.      He was probably born in Venice, the son of Guglielmo and his wife Anna Matteini, who had been awarded a Venetian passport. He quickly learned to compartmentalize his work in two departments, representing the art of Venetian history and antiquities, and the decorative scheme of Venetian palaces. He joined the Venetian painters' guild (Accademia della Pizzura) in 1606, and was a member of the Academy of Painters (1612–1680). He became a member of the Council of Ten (1620–1622) and a member of the Council of Forty (1623–1630) and the Academy of Painters (1634–1640). In the late 16th century, he served the Duke of Urbino in Venice. In the 17th century, he collaborated in the decoration of the Ducal Palace in Venice, which is now the home of Museo Correr. He painted the grandiose frescoes in the Palazzo Loredan dell'Ambasciatore in Venice. Barozzi painted a series of canvases for the apartments of Doge Francesco Morosini at his private Palazzo Barbarigo in Venice. He painted frescoes in the Villa Pisani at Stra. In 1710, he was commissioned to contribute a series of paintings depicting the Transit of Peter the Great and Saint Nicholas. These have been copied by other painters, including Canaletto, and the originals are kept at the Museo Correr in Venice.     Between 1710 and 1712, Barozzi painted a number of canvases for the Palazzo Loredan dell'Ambasciatore in Venice. These were experimental paintings with themes from Byzantine myth and history, but the Venetian painters had different ideas for what they wanted to present. Loredan preferred a classical approach with scenes set in an elegant  Renaissance style. He wanted to capture the feel of a party, rather than a coronation.    Barozzi's canvases were not published until 1727, and were simply not made available to anyone wanting them. He collaborated with Francesco Tiraolo and Francesco Meldolla in making  mosaics of some of the church's icons and saints.    The painting of Saints Peter and Paul and other Catholic saints by Barozzi was an important part of Venetian iconography during the Renaissance period. The mosaics are believed to have been produced between 1710 and 1714, and were intended for the palazzo where they were stored during the restoration of the Palazzo d'Italia in Venice in 1718. The mosaics are believed to have been completed around 1715. However, some of the mosaics in the ducal palace are dated 1714/1716, and the work was probably begun around 1716.     By 1719, Barozzi's career was firmly put back into commission. He helped decorate the ceiling of the chapel of the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice with portraits of Cardinal Francesco Bembo and his family, and of Joan of Arc. In the summer of 1719, the Italian painter Giuseppe Barozzi visited Paris and trained with Carracci. By 1722, he had left Venice for Rome. He painted a series of panels for the Dome of Bergamo from 1724–1729, and later, for the Dome of Bergamo from 1733 to 1739, and for the Dome of Bergamo from 1747 to 1751. In the course of his career, he helped decorate other churches including that of San Giovanni e Paolo (1728), Santa Maria Maddelena (1731), the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista (1734–1737), the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista (1737), the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista (1744), the Palazzo Gazzetta (1751), the Palazzo Giustinian (1756), the Palazzo Barbarigo
Salvatore Gallo was a Venetian Fuller. [SEP]    Born in Venice in the 1490s, Alvise Gallo spent much of his life in the city of Venice. At age 63, he decided to move to France, and in 1623, he served as a court physician to Louis I. From 1626 to 1629, he was a court physician to Charles I, with whom he was very close friends. As a physician, Gallo was very influential.    In the late 15th century, French physician and scholar Blaise Zoccola published several documents on the medical practice of Galba. These included the Magistracy of Galba, or, A Course of Medical Science; or, A Course of Practical Karate; or, Two Discourses on the Art of Fighting.    In 1633, Gallo published the Magistracy of Galba, which contained valuable historical, scientific, and moral information about the Roman Curia, the Byzantine Empire, and the medieval forms of medicine. Later, he published the  Jesu Christi generale, or, Jesu Christ and the Medico-Historical,   which contains historical material and a bibliography of historical sources. In the early 18th century, Giovanni Battista Grillo published the Panache anatomici et curiosi et humanistici et technologiche attested to the Saracen Empire, Venice, or its port in Dalmatia; this work was reprinted in 1878 by Grillo and Bertrandus Vaqueras.   
Giacinto Ricci was a Venetian Storyteller. [SEP]    He was the adopted son of Giovanni Ricci and his wife, and brother of Jacopo Ricci, and half-brother of Marco Ricci, the adopted son of Tommaso Ricci and his wife, and half-sister of Ginevrail Ricci, and sister of Marco Ricci. He was one of eight children born to Giacomo Ricci and his wife, and their father was Giovanni Ricci. In 1602, he married  Elise Piccinino, daughter of Francesco Piccinino, and sister of Francesco Piccinino, and half-sister of Ginevrail Ricci, and had four children:   Caroline Francesca (1613–1640), married to Baldassare Longhena, with whom she had ten children:   Ginevrail Francesca (1613–1640), unmarried and without children:   Giorgio Francesca (1613–1647), married to Anna Piscopia (died 1660), without children:   Andrea Francesca (1616–1692), without children:     He was primarily engaged in the production of historical, oratorical or otherwise literary works, but also of secular or profane stories; and, in a short period of time, he became interested in the history of his native city, hence began his long fascination with the mysterious history of Rome, especially the myths and legends around the city. This fascination led him to travel extensively, and to settle in Rome, for a period of about five years in 1624–26, where he visited many of the fabled sites of Rome, including those at Trevigiano, Trevigiano Virigini, and Natale Virigini. In Rome he became acquainted with the writings of Giacomo La Rocca and Giuseppe Federici, and became attached to their doctrines; he even studied with them a little, and became persuaded that they would prove a great help in the study of the occult sciences. In 1627 he visited Venice, and there established a correspondence with the authors of the Mysteries, with whom he remained in correspondence throughout the seventeenth century. Between 1629 and 1631 he visited Albizzi, and there settled in Bologna, where he became a member of the Accademia degli Incogniti, held an important position for a period of five years, where he was able to exert great labor and to receive from the Accademia a large number of assignments. He then joined the faculty of the University of Bologna, and there remained for some time in that institution, in various offices, including provveditore (vicellor), professor (superintendent), member of the Accademia giornale (subdean), professor (professorial organist), and professor (profession of singers and poets). In 1634, he joined the faculty of the University of Padova, where he became a professor of music and musicology, and also of madrigal music. He then went to Paris, where he met the then newly established Accademia of Paris, and was appointed as professor of music and musicology, and contracted a professor at the University of Padova, where he remained until his death in 1636. In Paris he acquired a reputation as a thorough, thoroughly scientific, and especially a theorist of the sacred music (the more so as he was the first to propose and defend the ideas of the ancients against the modern innovations). But, despite being regarded as a very capable man, he was not taken as a professor at Padova, and was instead appointed as a member of the Accademia fur Schönborn, who had been established at Padova in 1625 in opposition to the Academy of Paris.      
Gilberto De Luca was a Venetian Gardener. [SEP]    De Luca was the son of Paolo De Luca, who was a Venetian noble who owned land near the present Vartrana Zagurović-Wojtas. Pietro was educated at Padua and studied law and medicine at Padua and Padova. He was vice-doge of Venetian Republic from 1596 until his death. In 1564 he was elected as Doge of Venice. During his reign Venice was visited by Genoese commander of the neighborhood, Mantegna, who sent him a letter of congratulations. In 1566 he married Benedetta Pisani, daughter of Giovanni Pisani, a Venetian nobleman, who was the political mentor of his daughter's career. Pisani was also a noted poet and author. In 1575 he and his family moved to Mantua, where De Luca became the doge's chamberlain.    Among his many other appointments, he became the Venetian ambassador to the papal court.    In 1576 he was elected as Doge of Venice. During his reign Venice was visited by General Francesco Algarotti, commander of Venetian naval units, and saw a full-scale war between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice, which lasted for over a year. In 1577, the Peace of Ulcinium was signed, ending a long period of repeated attempts by the Venetian Republic to secure a peace for its colonies in the Balkans.    De Luca commissioned a series of paintings to celebrate the Republic's victory over the Ottoman Empire in the 1577 siege of Ulcinium. The paintings show Venetian troops engaged in battle against the Ottoman siege towers, with the colors Red, Green and Blue associated with victory. Two years later the Venetians engaged in the same siege for the second time, and in 1579 the two armies locked in an intense battle for years. The Venetians eventually breached the fortress of Ulcinium and held out until its defenders surrendered under heavy fire on 11 March 1588. The Venetians had suffered numerous defeats in the previous years, and they would not be allowed to repeat the experience. The last Byzantine fortress in the Venetian Zone lay in ruins, and the Venetians were forced to surrender. In the interim, De Luca commissioned a relief depicting Saints Peter and Paul and Judas Iscariot with Saints Peter and Paul and Judas Iscariot, among other subjects, in a church on Il Redentore in Rome.    In 1582 he was created provveditore of the Serenissima, a position that would last him until 1591. In this capacity, he was sent to recapture Passaro, the last major Byzantine stronghold in the Balkans. Upon his return he was instrumental in the negotiation between Venice and the Ottoman Empire regarding the creation of a Venetian-Ottoman zone from 1590 to 1594. This effort failed, and in 1593 De Luca was forced into exile, taking refuge in Venice. During this time he also began to paint, a process that took several more years for him to complete. In 1594 he was forced to leave Venice due to the Ottoman threat, and in 1595 he returned to paint in Venice. He would paint in Venice until his death in 1598.    In 1597 he was elected as a member of the Ten, and in 1599 he was created a member of the Board of Governors. In this capacity he was instrumental in the negotiation between Venice and the Ottoman Empire regarding the purchase of Passaro. In 1597 a peace was signed that saw the two empires withdraw to the Peloponnese, and De Luca was allowed to proceed with the fortifications of Passaro. In the same year he was named captain of the guard, and was personally involved in the construction of the fortress of Koper.In 1603 he was named captain of the fortress of Negroponte, and was personally involved in the construction of the fortress of Koper.    In 1606, he was elected as a member of the Savi di Terraferma, and was personally involved in the construction of the fortress of Koper. In 1608 he was named captain of the campione d'opretti of the Venetian frontier, and was personally involved in the construction of the fortress of Koper. In 1610 he was made a Savi di Terraferma, and was personally involved in the construction of the fortress of Koper. In 1612 he was named captain of the guard at Treviso.    In 1614, he became a member of the Senate of Venice, and was personally involved in the negotiation between Venice and the Ottoman Empire regarding the purchase of Passaro. In 1616 he was again elected as a Savi di Terraferma, and

Arnaldo De Luca was a Venetian Navigator. [SEP]    He was born in Venice in 1519. He studied law and theology at Padova, where he was a professor of philosophy, politics, and law. In 1542 he received his doctorate of Laws from the University of Padova. His original works include:    De Luca's system of judicial system: An oration of the Dolfin brothers, with a comparison of the Venetian legal system with that of Florence, and a comparison of the judicial procedure of Venice with that of Florence. (1542)   
Aldo De Luca was a Venetian Grave Digger. [SEP]    His first job as a mercenary was as a mercenary in the service of the Republic of Venice, for which he dug trenches and other works in the region of Ubane and Ubani. He then moved to Brescia, where he was hired to dig trenches for the construction of the bridge to Istria and Brescia. After this, he moved to Marseille, for which he worked for the state. He was also employed by other state bodies for the construction of bridges and roads in the region of Ubani and Brescia. In 1824, he became a member of the Istria Mining Club and continued digging in the region of Ubani and Brescia. Around 1825, he was hired by Albani to dig ditches in the area of Ubuera. Albani would continue to work for Albani until 1829, when he was hired by the Albani family of Ubani.    In 1810, Albani was in Brescia, to work for the municipality there. He moved to Brescia in 1812, where he became a professor of civil and structural engineering at the University of Brescia. In 1819, he became a member of the Accademia of Sciences of Brescia. His pupils included Stefano Maggiotto, Ludovico Lipparini, Antonio Lotti, Pietro Lazzari.    In 1813, Albani was in Turin, working on the plan of the Alcantara-Noguchi tunnel, the first tunnel under the sea from La Plata to Bergamo. He returned to Venice, where he and his family lived. In 1816, Albani was in Padua, working on the configuration of the Piazza San Marco.    In 1818, Albani was in Padua, again as a professor of civil and structural engineering, and was involved in the design and construction of the La Plata-Dubrovnik tunnel, the first tunnel under the sea from La Plata to Bergamo. He designed the post-Civil War section of the Vittorio Veneto-Real tunnel system, which ended in 1819 with the construction of the Vittorio Veneto-Barzione Veneziane (Tunnel of the Venetians). This design was followed by many other tunnels under the sea, including the Pasqualigo-Dubrovnik (1822), and the much smaller La Plata-Dubrovnik (1822-24) and the Rivoa-Dubrovnik (1829-1831) to Venetian soil. Albani was one of the engineers involved in the design of the latter two tunnels, which were completed in 1819. It was also during this period that he was also one of the many Venetian citizens who were employed in the excavation of the old mines near Vicenza.    In 1819, Albani became a member of the Accademia of Sciences of Brescia, a prestigious academic group, numbering approximately forty scholars, including Venetian Academy members. The Accademia was one of the few academic groups that continued to publish after the abolition of the Academy in 1831; in addition to scientific matters, the Accademia published literary works, colloquially known as  "livre charters", colloquially known as  "lectures", and dissertations, which were popular among scholars of the time for their grammatical facility.    In 1820, he became a member of the Accademia of Urbino, the official writing branch of the Academy. He served as its secretary and treasurer. In 1821, he became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions a éditeur, a committee of literary agents, scholars and officials, headed by the famous Éditeur Gustin de Caïen. In this position, he undertook numerous important literary works, some of which were not published until the nineteenth century. Among other works, he wrote a biography of Napoleon III, published in 1822.In 1822, he married the lawyer Maria Pasqualigo, mother of the future Pope Clement XIII.     In 1825, he became a member of the Spanish Academy, joining the Accademia of Sciences, where he became a professor of rhetoric. In 1829, he married the poet Algernon Wyclif, who would become the father of Francesco Wyclif, and wife Ursula Graham, sister of John Ruskin, who also became a professor of rhetoric at the Academy. In 1830, he and his wife founded the Academy of Bellas Artes. In 1832, he was appointed a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, a prestigious literary society.In 1833, he became a member of the Venetian Academy. In
Piero Rizzo was a Venetian Mason. [SEP]      He was born in Venice, in the parish of Santa Maria della Pedice. He was apprenticed to a Venetian woman named Cecilia Contarini who claimed descent from the noble Venetian family of Rizzo. He was initially educated by his father in the monastery of Verona. He entered the Benedictine Order in Padua and was ordained to the priesthood in Padua on 15 November 1602. In 1607, he left the monastery and visited Venice. On his return he was appointed as secretary to the Vestal Virgins and was consecrated as a priest in the order on 22 November 1608. In 1611, he became a confessor and minister of the Vestal Virgins, an important position in the order. He was a friend of  Henry IV of France and spent the years 1613–1615 as a hostage of Henry IV in the aftermath of the Fall of Constantinople. On 30 May 1614, he visited the Ducal Palace in Rome to receive his orders. In 1616-17 he appeared as  chancellor to the King of France. On 20 October 1617, he was appointed provveditore di Terraferma. He held this post until 1621, when he joined the Venetian Senate. He was vice-doge in the Constitutions first published by the Venetian Senate and then as podestà of Venetian mercantile district in Milan, where he was elected to succeed Francesco Morosini as Podestà of the Republic of Venice.In 1619-20, he appeared as podestà of Palazzo Loredan in Venice. He held this post until 1624, when he was elected Doge. He held this post until the end of the world war on 11 December 1624.      In 1623, he was appointed as podestà of the Ducal Palace in Rome, a post he held for two years. During this time, he appeared to be in possession of the most intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Roman Curia. He became podestà of the Ducal Court in Brescia and its previous occupants on 9 May 1625, 1627, and finally on 25 September 1629, as podestà of the Venetian Lodge in Brescia. In this position, he was able to confer with the Venetian nobility. He appeared to have a close personal relationship with Doge Francesco Foscari, who appeared to be his mentor from childhood. In 1631, he married the German dancer and singer Maria Ammanni. In 1634, he became a doctor of medicine, and on 8 July 1638, he became vice-doge.     He appears to have had a short-term fixation on the art of painting. After attending the Academy of Venice, on 1 June 1638, he was appointed to the faculty of the famous Academy of Venice. In this position, he was able to negotiate the sale of the Academy, which had been held by the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, to the French court at Charles VII. In 1646, he became a director of the Academy of Venice. These positions were all consistent with the interests of the major Venetian Venetian patrons, to whom he was subject for life. He appears to have cared little for the arts or literature of his time, and was content to make money by embroidery. He died in Brescia on 8 July 1650.      The year is generally given as 1638–1651, with some uncertainty because Giustiniani arrived in Venice as a free man in 1639.     He favored the use of Venetian art, and his disciples followed his lead. Giovanni Battista Palazzi (collected by Leopold Wilhelm) was one of the first artists to use the Venetian school in his embroidery. His disciples included his daughter Giovanna Carlo and her sister María Elena Carpioni. Giustiniani was a patroness of the Academy of Venice and had bought a share in the leases of the buildings and supplies used in it.     Giuseppe Giustiniani was born in Venice, the son of Tommaso Giustiniani, a member of the Giustiniani family, which had come to Italy from Brescia in the 1490s. In 1636, he was awarded a noble family position in the town of Chiesa in Veneto, then a Blackrock, then a land grant from the Venetian state. After a period of time in Brescia, he settled in Venice, where he became a member of the distinguished court of King Philip II. From 1640 to 1644, Giustiniani embroidered garments for the king,

Coriolano Ricci was a Venetian Locksmith. [SEP]          The name Coriolano is a trademark of Italiano company Coriolano.       He was born in Venice in 1625 of a family of modest means, but distinguished in the vine-growing community. His father, Giovanni, was a carpenter, while his mother, Elisabetta Tagliapietra, was a housewife.     Coriolano received a first lesson in viniculture from his father, before he entered the vine-cultivation school of Venice.  When not engaged in any branch of the business, he was employed as a trader, and later as a magistrate.  In 1633, he became the first to declare that the vines of Coriolano were superior to those of Bologna.  In 1635, he was made a member of the Venetian vine-cultivation guild.  In 1637, he was elected as a member of the zonta of the Republic of Venice.  In 1638, he entered the family business, which employed him in various capacities including court jester, bailiff, bailiwick (landlord), and secretary.  He was also a member of the Venetian vine-guild, and was provveditore of vine-land (land used for vine-cultivation).  In 1641, he partnered with Francesco Foscarini and Flavio Ricci to form the first Italian company to import viticultural commodities through a coastal route.  The resulting import company, interested in both vine and nutmeg, was influential throughout the eastern Mediterranean.  The company's wines were named after their regions of origin.  Coriolano also played a role in the formation of the first siesti di Passariano,  a regional grapevilla extending from the towns of Passariano in the south to Passariano in the north.  The Venetian variant of the Sicilian village of Passariano was named after him.    In his numerous other roles, Coriolano played a banker, a politician, and a banker.     In 1634, the Venetian government commissioned him to design an elaborate new city wall for the new city of Venice.  The wall was meant to prevent ships from sailing through narrow canals along the waterfront, and to provide a conspicuous place for tourists on grandiose walls.  Coriolano designed the wall himself, and contributed many details to its construction.  The resulting urban landscape, the Plan di Siena, is one of Venice's grand architectural achievements.  The lack of storm walls hindered the best agricultural practices and allowed for easy cultivation of the surrounding countryside.  Coriolano died in Venice in 1636, and was buried in the Basilica di Sant'Agostino.   
Armando Conti was a Venetian Solicitor. [SEP]    Conti was born in Venice in 1564, and was the son of a rich family. He was the son of the writer Vittoria Conti and her husband Giuseppe Conti. He was a writer and poet, and wrote or completed works as numerous as those by Cipriano de Rore and Andrea Palladio. He was married to Cecilia Bordoni.    In 1619, he entered the service of the Republic of Venice as a Solicitor, and by 1624 he was their most valuable asset. The Senate of Venice required that he act as their representative during the legal disputes arising in the Republic. In 1628, he took the last name of Conti, and had fifteen judgeships, the most prestigious position in the Venetian legal system. In his capacity as Solicitor, he arbitrated numerous disputes between Venetian courts and the Papacy, and presided over the Venetian Republic's most important intellectual property cases, including the import and export of books, manuscripts, and CDs.

Amadeo Marino was a Venetian Fisherman. [SEP]    Marino, a young Venetian, married in 1320, the daughter of the rich and noble Antonio of Valois and his second wife, the Ratac Abbey and subsequent grant of the latter's land to his son. Marino inherited the island of Syros and its industrial past. As a vassal of the House of Hino, he approved of the Venetian mercantile activities, such as the construction of the first docks at Argos and Messina. He also commissioned various fortifications on the island, such as the first fortifications on the mainland and a second at the frazione of Corfu. The foundation of the fortress was laid by his death. Marino has been called the father of the lagoon.    Marino was a small, nautical-minded man, who enjoyed the company of good women. He was most concerned about the management of the lagoon, which had become an important part of the Venetian economy. He believed that the best way to improve the situation of the lagoon was to establish canals and waterways that could be navigated by boat. This idea was further developed during the 15th century, when the Venetian navy began to construct canals that brought canals to the islands of Curzola and Corfu. The Venetians would also construct the first canals in the Venetian Lagoon in 1573.       
Amadeo Rossi was a Venetian Shipwright. [SEP]    Born in Venice in 1518, he enlisted at a young age in the navy of the republic of Venice. He was promoted admiral of the ship that won a battle off Genoa in 1575 and participated in the final stages of the siege of Durazzo. He also led a fleet of 35 galleys in a delaying action against the archipelago of Crete. In 1579, he was in the fleet that defeated the larger Persian navy off Bactria. In 1581, he was a governor of Negroponte. In 1585, he was governor of the Duchy of the Archipelago in a guest of the victor, then governor of Chios, then governor of the islands of Paros, Santorinium and Thirassia, and finally governor of Negroponte.     In his later years, he was a survivor of a shipwreck. In a battle near Acre in 1589, he lost a larger fleet but was not captured, and returned to Venice, where he was elected captain of the squadron. In 1590, he led a Republican army which defeated the satyrical ruler of Ithaca, John I d'Este, in a naval battle off Crete.    In 1593, he and his fleet of 35 galleys raided Flanders. The Venetians, led by the newly elected Doge Alvise Contarini, used the river Meuse to transport the plunder. In a truce signed in Crete on 14 December 1593, he was to reimburse the losses of the Venetian fleet in the event of his capture. On 28 December 1594, he was governor of Ithaca again. In 1595, he was defeated by the satyrical ruler of Colchis, Cosimo I d'Este, but did not abandon his post, and was appointed as a satyrical court to the next emperor, who chose him for his experience and capacity to resist Pisani's ambitions. In 1596, he was governor of Santorinium, Santorinium e Therasia, a fief in the Venetian Aegean.    In 1596, he participated in the final stages of the siege of Durazzo. In this campaign, he was one of the main belligerents in the Morea War between the Republic of Venice and the Byzantine Empire. He was forced to evacuate Santorinium and Therasia, and suffered losses in the process. The Venetians won the Morea War, and he was recognized as the new ruler of the Principatum Venetorum.      At around the same time, he also became a participant in the Venetian-Ottoman war of 1595-96. He fought as illy as the Venetian chronicler Stefano Querini in the Morea War of 1594, but was content to return to Venice, where he could earn a comfortable living as a commercial captain and happily settled into the Ducal Castle of Santorini. He was unhappy with the Venetian surrender terms, and sought to incite a Venetian recrimination. In 1509, he was created provveditore of Alcantara, and soon renamed provveditore of Santorini. While still in Alcantara, he was to reconquer Fiume, restore order to the island, and to negotiate peace agreements for the creation of a Venetian colony in the Morea and for the surrender of the Morea to the Ottoman Empire.      At around the same time, Marechal II de' Medici was elected Duke of Candia, and soon moved to the Venetian court in Rome. There, he enjoyed the warmest relations with Pope Clement VII, but little else. In 1564, the Ottoman war began, and Marechal served as war commander for the Venetians. In 1570, the Senate of Venice authorized him to collect taxes from the Venetian merchants in Crete. The rebels in Crete used the harbor of Candia as a base for their operations, and the Venetians were forced to confront the possibility of a pitched battle. The Venetians were able to clear the island of the enemy, but not Marechal, who was forced to return to Venice. In the meantime, the Senate of Venice authorized him to collect taxes from the Venetians in Crete. In 1574, he was to return to Crete. In 1585, the Senate of Venice authorized him to haul the enemy fleet away from Candia, and to set sail for the besieged Venetian city of Candia. On its return journey, the Venetians recaptured a stratioti fortress at Candia. The Venetians also recaptured a fort of the same general type at Candia, but they

Paride Conti was a Venetian Peddler. [SEP]     He was born in Venice in 1510 of a noble Venetian family, and passed his youth in Venice. From 1594 to 1599 he was  employed by the court of Savoy at various positions, and from there to Constantinople, for whom he was the most important Venetian diplomat.  During his time in Constantinople he played an important role in the negotiations between the Byzantine Emperors and the Republic over the re-adoption of the Byzantine heraldry of the Latin alphabet.  After the death of the heralds of the Latin alphabet, Conti played an important role in negotiations between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Turks over the re-introduction of the heraldry of the Latin alphabet.  He was vice-geon of the Venetian Fleet in 1591-92 and commander of the Venetian fortress at Corfu in 1594-96.    In 1594 Conti accompanied Vettore Cappello on a diplomatic mission to Florence.  During this mission he met Bartolomeo della Rovere, the Venetian ambassador to Florence, and his brother Giuseppe, a Venetian patrician who served as Venice's ambassador to Genoa.  After the meeting, Conti wrote a congratulatory letter to the Florentine government for Bartolomeo's election as Doge.  This was the first time a Venetian had been awarded such an honor.  In the same year, Conti was sent to negotiate over the re-conquest of Kephalos, the last Byzantine stronghold in the Peloponnese.  During his time in Constantinople, Conti played an important role in the negotiations between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Turks over the re-introduction of the heraldry of the Latin alphabet.  In 1596, Venice and the Ottoman Sultanate signed a treaty introducing the heraldry of the Latin alphabet to the Byzantine Empire.  This heraldry was introduced in the Byzantine Empire by the Sultan Süleyman I (r. 1597–1453) and it remained in force until the Ottoman conquest of Corinth in 1587.  In 1594 Conti proposed the adoption of the heraldry of the Latin alphabet by the Ottoman Sultanates.  This was the first time a Venetian had been awarded such an honor.  In 1597 Conti presented the Ottoman Sultan with the Golden Book, the official Venetian version of the Golden Book.  This was the first Golden Book to be awarded to a foreign power.  It contained detailed information on the Jewish people, their laws, customs, and culture.  The only mention of Jewish language was in the introduction and the last sentence, which read "This book is for Turks only".  The introduction to the book described the Book as an historical record, which was recognized by the Signory of Venice and other Venetian courts as such.  It was printed in Venice and contained detailed information on the history of the Jewish people, their laws, customs and culture.  The description of Kephalos was one of the inspirations for Zdravić.  The geography of the district was described as "mixed and inaccurate", and the inhabitants were described as having various customs, including those concerning war and betrayal.  Conti was the first to use the geographical region "Crete" in place of "Jerusalem", which had been coined by other authors, and he was the first to use this name to describe the region of Peloponnese.  The region of Peloponnese was later named "The Land of Israel" after the biblical city of Jerusalem.         In 1596, Conti was named by the Senate of Venice as one of the four captains of Venice, one of three Venetian envoys to the Ottoman Sultan Suleyman I (r. 1597–1453).  This was the highest honor a Venetian could receive.  The other two were Francesco Conti, who was appointed Vice-Doge in Istanbul, and Alvise Conti, who was appointed Captain-General of the Venetian Navy.  Both were dismissed from office after they returned to Venice.  Conti died in Venice in 1599, and was buried in the Basilica of the National Museum of Art in Bologna.     During the Ottoman–Venetian War (1575–1579), Conti was sent in Egypt as Consul General of Venetian Forces and one of the most important diplomatic agents between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire.  After the war, Conti was sent to Constantinople as the second Consul of Venetian Forces, and then to the Ottoman capital to serve as the Venetian ambassador to the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II (r. 1579–1589).  After Meh
